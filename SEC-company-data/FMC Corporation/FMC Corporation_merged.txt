risk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization- our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. competition- all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. additionally, in agricultural products, competition includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredient, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds, and intellectual property regarding production or use of pesticides. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. changes in our customer base- our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions- our agricultural products markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment- changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our agricultural products business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify that their chemicals can be marketed safely through a special registration system . climate change regulation- changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations, particularly certain industrial chemicals operations in the united states, to significant additional costs or limits on operations. raw materials and energy costs- our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in the costs of raw materials or energy. supply arrangements and production hazards- certain raw materials are critical to our production process, especially in our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or execute under the contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, especially in agricultural products. an inability to obtain these products or execute under the contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. our facilities and those of our key contract manufacturers are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business. 17 table of contents economic and political change- our business could be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. foreign operations- the company's foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability. economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in brazil, our customers face a combination of economic factors that could result in cash flow pressures that lead to slower payments. market access risk- our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. in certain agricultural products segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which we do not have majority control. where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios. business disruptions- our business could be adversely affected by information technology systems outages or intrusions, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. operational risks- the company's manufacturing operations inherently entail hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as leaks, ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. if operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the company's ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flow. litigation and environmental risks- current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials- we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance- the company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. technology risks: our ability to compete successfully, particularly in agricultural products and specialty chemicals, depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. financial risks: while we have seen signs of recovery in global economic activity and in worldwide credit markets since the financial crisis that commenced in 2008, a general slowdown in economic activity caused by an economic recession could adversely affect our business. a worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to fully perform their commitments to us. we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the euro, the brazilian real and the chinese yuan. to a lesser extent, we are sensitive to the mexican peso, the argentine peso, the british pound sterling and several asian currencies, including the japanese yen. we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. 18 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market-value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2011, our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $5.9 million compared to a net liability of $6.8 million at december 31, 2010. the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios. commodity price risk energy costs are approximately nine percent of our cost of sales and services and are diversified among coal, electricity, and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2011 and december 31, 2010, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease in the net liability position of $2.5 million at december 31, 2011, compared to a $3.4 million decrease of the net liability position at december 31, 2010. a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of $2.5 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2011, compared to an increase of $3.4 million of the net liability position at december 31, 2010. our agricultural products segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans. to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts, we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure. as of december 31, 2011 our net financial instrument position was immaterial. as of december 31, 2010, we had no such contracts in place. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the u.s. dollar versus the chinese yuan and the u.s. dollar versus the brazilian real. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2011 and december 31, 2010, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of $2.4 million in the net asset position at december 31, 2011, compared to an increase of $33.3 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2010. a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of $2.1 million in the net 42 table of contents asset position at december 31, 2011, compared to a decrease of $31.1 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2010. as a result, at december 31, 2011, the net asset position would have become a net liability position whereas the net liability position at december 31, 2010 would have become a net asset position. interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2011 and december 31, 2010, we had no interest rate swap agreements. our debt portfolio, at december 31, 2011, is composed of 95 percent fixed-rate debt and five percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2011 credit agreement, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2011, a one percentage point increase in interest rates then in effect would have increased gross interest expense by $0.4 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates then in effect would have decreased gross interest expense by $0.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2011.risk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization- our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. competition- all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. our industrial chemicals - alkali division from time to time experiences competitive pricing pressures from our chinese competition who will price their products at or near their manufacturing costs in an attempt to gain control of or reacquire short-term market position. additionally, in agricultural products, competition includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredient, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds, and intellectual property regarding production or use of pesticides. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. changes in our customer base- our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions- our agricultural products markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment- changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our agricultural products business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify that their chemicals can be marketed safely through a special registration system . fda regulation - some of our manufacturing processes and facilities, as well as some of our customers, are subjected to regulation by the fda or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. climate change regulation- changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations, particularly certain industrial chemicals operations in the united states, to significant additional costs or limits on operations. raw materials and energy costs- our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in the costs of raw materials or energy. supply arrangements and production hazards- certain raw materials are critical to our production process, especially in our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or execute under the contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, especially in agricultural products. an inability to obtain these products or execute under the contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. our facilities and those of our key contract manufacturers are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business and could also negatively impact the company's reputation. 16 table of contents economic and political change- our business could be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. in argentina, continued tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business. foreign operations- the company's foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability. economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. inflation as a result of economic and political conditions especially in argentina could adversely affect our operations and have unfavorable impact to our financial results. market access risk- our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. in certain agricultural products segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which we do not have majority control. where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios. business disruptions- our business could be adversely affected by information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about us, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. operational risks- the company's manufacturing operations inherently entail hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as leaks, ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. if operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the company's ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flow. litigation and environmental risks- current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials- we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance- the company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. the company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. inability to attract and retain key employees - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. technology risks: our ability to compete successfully, particularly in agricultural products and specialty chemicals, depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. 17 table of contents financial risks: further deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in brazilian economic growth or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the euro, the brazilian real and the chinese yuan. to a lesser extent, we are sensitive to the mexican peso, the argentine peso, the british pound sterling and several asian currencies, including the japanese yen. our effective tax rate is favorably impacted by the fact that a portion of our earnings are taxed at more favorable rates in some jurisdictions outside the united states. changes in tax laws or in their application with respect to matters such as transfer pricing, dividends from subsidiaries or restriction in tax relief allowed on intercompany debt could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results. we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market-value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2012 , our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $2.2 million compared to a net liability of $5.9 million at december 31, 2011 . the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. commodity price risk energy costs are approximately seven percent of our cost of sales and services and are diversified among coal, electricity, and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2012 and 2011 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 39 table of contents percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease in the net liability position of $4.6 million at december 31, 2012 , compared to a $2.5 million decrease of the net liability position at december 31, 2011 . as a result, at december 31, 2012, the net liability position would have become a net asset. a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of $4.1 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2012 , compared to an increase of $2.5 million of the net liability position at december 31, 2011 . our agricultural products segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans. to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts, we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 our net financial instrument position was immaterial. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the u.s. dollar versus the chinese yuan and the u.s. dollar versus the brazilian real. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2012 and 2011 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of $5.5 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2012, compared to an increase of $2.4 million in the net asset position at december 31, 2011 . as a result, at december 31, 2012, the net liability position would have become a net asset. a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of $4.3 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2012 , compared to a decrease of $2.1 million in the net asset position at december 31, 2011 . interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2012 and 2011 , we had no interest rate swap agreements. our debt portfolio, at december 31, 2012 , is composed of 83 percent fixed-rate debt and 17 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2011 credit agreement, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2012 , a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $1.6 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $1.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2012 .risk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization- our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. competition- all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. our fmc minerals - alkali division from time to time experiences competitive pricing pressures from our chinese competition who will price their products at or near their manufacturing 13 table of contents costs in an attempt to gain control of or reacquire short-term market position. additionally, in fmc agricultural solutions, competition includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredient, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds, and intellectual property regarding production or use of pesticides. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. changes in our customer base- our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our fmc minerals and fmc health and nutrition businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions- our fmc agricultural solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment- changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our fmc agricultural solutions business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify that their chemicals can be marketed safely through a special registration system . food and pharmaceutical regulation - some of our manufacturing processes and facilities, as well as some of our customers, are subjected to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. climate change regulation- changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations, particularly certain fmc minerals' operations in the united states, to significant additional costs or limits on operations. raw materials and energy costs- our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in the costs of raw materials or energy. supply arrangements- certain raw materials are critical to our production process. while we have

ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers. an inability to obtain these products or execute under the contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. in fmc minerals geological conditions can affect production of raw materials. economic and political change- our business could be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business. market access risk- our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. in certain fmc agricultural solutions segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which 14 table of contents we do not have majority control. where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios. business disruptions- our business could be adversely affected by information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about us, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. operational risks- our manufacturing operations and those of our key contract manufacturers inherently entail hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as leaks, ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. if operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the company's ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flow. litigation and environmental risks- current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials- we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance- we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. inability to attract and retain key employees - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. technology risks: our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. financial risks: deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in either brazilian or argentine economic growth or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the euro, the brazilian real and the chinese yuan. to a lesser extent, we are sensitive to the mexican peso, the argentine peso, the british pound sterling and several asian currencies, including the japanese yen. our effective tax rate is favorably impacted by the fact that a portion of our earnings are taxed at more favorable rates in some jurisdictions outside the united states. changes in tax laws or in their application with respect to matters such as transfer pricing, dividends from subsidiaries or restriction in tax relief allowed on intercompany debt could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results. 15 table of contents we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market-value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2013 , our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $6.4 million compared to a net liability of $2.2 million at december 31, 2012 . the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. commodity price risk energy costs are diversified among coal, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2013 and 2012 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged energy exposure vs. energy market pricing (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets 10% increase 10% decrease net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2013 $0.1 $3.0 $(2.7) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2012 (1.3) $3.3 $(5.4) our fmc agricultural solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans. to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts, we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012 our net financial instrument position was immaterial. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the u.s. dollar versus the chinese yuan, the u.s. dollar versus the brazilian real and the u.s. dollar versus the argentine peso. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. 38 table of contents to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2013 and 2012 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged currency vs. functional currency (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets 10% strengthening 10% weakening net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2013 $(6.5) $9.1 $(21.0) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2012 $(0.9) $4.6 $(5.2) interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012 , we had no interest rate swap agreements. our debt portfolio, at december 31, 2013 , is composed of 63 percent fixed-rate debt and 37 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our commercial paper program, credit facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2013 , a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $6.8 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $2.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2013 .risk factor 12 risk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization - our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. competition - all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. our fmc agricultural solutions, competition includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredient, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds, and intellectual property regarding production or use of 12 table of contents pesticides. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. changes in our customer base - our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our fmc minerals and fmc health and nutrition businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions - our fmc agricultural solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment - changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our fmc agricultural solutions business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify that their chemicals can be marketed safely through a special registration system . geographic concentration - although we have operations in most regions throughout the globe, the majority of our fmc agricultural solutions sales outside the united states have principally been to customers in brazil, argentina and mexico. with the acquisition of cheminova, we will expand the reach of international sales to include europe and key asian countries. accordingly, developments in those parts of the world generally have a more significant effect on our operations than developments in other places. our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. food and pharmaceutical regulation - some of our manufacturing processes and facilities, as well as some of our customers, are subjected to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. climate change regulation - changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations. fluctuations in commodity prices - our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities such as raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in commodity pricing. accordingly, increases in commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. where practical, we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. we also use raw material supply agreements that contain terms designed to mitigate the risk of short-term changes in commodity prices. however, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. additionally, fluctuations in commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their product at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers' abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables. supply arrangements - certain raw materials are critical to our production process. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or execute under the contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a limited number of suppliers. an inability to obtain these products or execute under our existing contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. in fmc minerals geological conditions can affect production of raw materials. economic and political change - our business could be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and 13 table of contents economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business. operational risks: market access risk - our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. in certain fmc agricultural solutions segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which we do not have majority control. where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios. business disruptions - although historically, we have engaged in contract manufacturing and have not owned and operated its own manufacturing facilities, cheminova (upon acquisition) owns and operates large-scale manufacturing facilities in denmark and india. after the cheminova acquisition is completed, our operating results will be dependent on the continued operation of its various production facilities and the ability to manufacture products on schedule. interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties. although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include, explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of incorrect or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities. our manufacturing operations and those of our key contract manufacturers inherently entail hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as leaks, ruptures, fire, explosions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, other environmental risks, mechanical failure or other hazards beyond our control such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations, large scale power outages or vehicle accidents. if operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact our ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flow. information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about us, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. capital-intensive business - with our impending acquisition of cheminova, our business will be more capital intensive than it has been historically. we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. moreover, interest payments, dividends, the expansion of our business and pursuit of other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and the cost of new capital will be dependent upon the state of the capital markets generally and the market participants' assessment of the adequacy of our creditworthiness. there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global 14 table of contents credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, adversely affecting our operating results. we may use our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to provide for our cash needs, including supporting our commercial paper program. as of december 31, 2014, we had approximately $924 million of available credit capacity, after considering utilization for letters of credit and support for our commercial paper program. in the event of a default under our credit agreements or any of our senior notes, we could be required to repay immediately outstanding borrowings, redeem commercial paper notes outstanding, and make cash deposits as collateral for letters of credit that the facility supports, and we may not have the financial resources to do so. a default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to continue business operations. litigation and environmental risks - current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials - we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance - we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws. regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in its manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. inability to attract and retain key employees - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. technology risks: our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. portfolio management risks: we expect to complete the acquisition of cheminova and the divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division in early 2015. the majority of our expected proceeds from the sale of the fmc alkali chemicals division will be used to settle a portion of the borrowings that will be used to complete the acquisition of cheminova. any significant delay in the sale of our alkali chemicals division or an inability to complete the sale of our alkali chemicals division could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as a result of the acquisition borrowings remaining outstanding longer than expected. the expected sale of the alkali chemicals division is subject to various conditions, complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions. completion of the divestment of our fmc alkali chemicals division will be contingent upon customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our diverse portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with its growth strategy. as part of this evaluation we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets and gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets may affect the company's earnings. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce its earnings. in particular, if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop cheminova as planned, after the acquisition has been completed, could result in our inability to achieve the synergies we have projected and could thereby cause our future results of operations to be materially and adversely worse than expected. part of the synergies we expect to generate is the improvement of the cost-efficiency of cheminova's business operations. another is to reduce the mix of cheminova's sales from generic, lower margin products to more differentiated and higher margin products. yet another will be the 15 table of contents favorable rationalization of the different distribution channels used by fmc and cheminova in overlapping european markets. there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving these planned synergies. financial risks: deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, particularly latin american regions, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodity at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the euro, the brazilian real and the chinese yuan. to a lesser extent, we are sensitive to the mexican peso, the argentine peso, the british pound sterling and several asian currencies, including the japanese yen. our acquisition of cheminova will significantly expand our operations and sales in foreign countries and correspondingly increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks. our effective tax rate is favorably impacted by the fact that a portion of our earnings are taxed at more favorable rates in some jurisdictions outside the united states. changes in tax laws or in their application with respect to matters such as transfer pricing, dividends from subsidiaries or restriction in tax relief allowed on intercompany debt could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results. we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market-value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2014 , our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $92.5 million compared to a net liability of $6.4 million at december 31, 2013 . the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to higher unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. commodity price risk energy costs are diversified among coal, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2014 and 2013 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged energy exposure vs. energy market pricing (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% increase net asset / (liability) position with 10% decrease net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2014 $(7.3) $(5.3) $(9.4) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2013 $0.1 $3.0 $(2.7) our fmc agricultural solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans. to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts, we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 our net financial instrument position was immaterial. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the chinese yuan, the brazilian real and the argentine peso. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2014 and 2013 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged currency vs. functional currency (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% strengthening net asset / (liability) position with 10% weakening net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2014 (1) $(85.2) $91.3 $(261.0) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2013 $(6.5) $9.1 $(21.0) ______________ (1) includes the unrealized loss on hedging the purchase price of cheminova. interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 , we had no interest rate swap agreements. 41 table of contents our debt portfolio, at december 31, 2014 , is composed of 70 percent fixed-rate debt and 30 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our commercial paper program, credit facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2014 , a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $5.1 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $2.5 million for the year ended december 31, 2014 .risk factors 12 risk factors below lists our risk factors updated for these events. among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization - our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. competition - all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. competition for our fmc agricultural solutions business, includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. increased generic presence in agricultural 12 table of contents chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. changes in our customer base - our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our fmc lithium and fmc health and nutrition businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions - our fmc agricultural solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment - changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china, argentina and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our fmc agricultural solutions business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely . geographic concentration - although we have operations in most regions, the majority of our fmc agricultural solutions sales outside the united states have principally been to customers in latin america, including brazil, argentina and mexico. with the acquisition of cheminova, we are expanding our international sales, particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india. accordingly, developments in those parts of the world will generally have a more significant effect on our operations. our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. food and pharmaceutical regulation - some of our manufacturing processes and facilities, as well as some of our customers, are subject to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. climate change regulation - changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations. fluctuations in commodity prices - our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities such as raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in commodity pricing. accordingly, increases in commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. where practical, we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. we also use raw material supply agreements that contain terms designed to mitigate the risk of short-term changes in commodity prices. however, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. additionally, fluctuations in commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers' abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables. supply arrangements - certain raw materials are critical to our production process. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers. an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. in fmc lithium, geological conditions can affect production of raw materials. economic and political change - our business has been and could continue be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or 13 table of contents expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business. in brazil, which makes up a larger portion of our agricultural solutions business in latin america since our acquisition of cheminova in the second quarter of 2015, continued high inflation and economic recession could continue to adversely affect our business. operational risks: market access risk - our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. business disruptions - although more recently, fmc agricultural solutions has engaged in pesticide active ingredient contract manufacturing rather than owned and operated fmc own manufacturing facilities, cheminova owns and operates large-scale manufacturing facilities in denmark and india. this will present us with additional operating risks, in that our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the various acquired production facilities and the ability to manufacture products on schedule. interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties. although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of incorrect or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities. information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. capital-intensive business - with the acquisition of cheminova, our business is more capital intensive than it has been historically. we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results. we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. in the event of a default this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. litigation and environmental risks - current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. 14 table of contents hazardous materials - we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance - we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws. regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. inability to attract and retain key employees - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization. technology risks: our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively. portfolio management risks: we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets (e.g., divesting) may affect the company's earnings. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. in particular, an inability to successfully integrate and develop cheminova as planned could result in our inability to achieve the synergies we have projected and could thereby cause our future results of operations to be materially and adversely worse than expected. we expect to generate synergies as a result of i) improving cheminova operating cost-efficiencies, ii) changing the mix of cheminova's sales from generic, lower margin products to more differentiated and higher margin products, and iii) rationalizing of the distribution channels used by fmc and cheminova in overlapping european markets. however, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving these planned synergies. financial risks: deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect our customers ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, particularly latin american regions, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. the ongoing economic recession in brazil has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business there. we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real, the euro, the argentine peso and the chinese yuan. to a lesser extent, we are sensitive to the mexican peso, the british pound sterling and several asian currencies. our acquisition of cheminova has significantly expanded our operations and sales in foreign countries and correspondingly increased our exposure to foreign exchange risks. during 2015, adverse changes in the brazilian real exchange rate adversely impacted our financial results and continued weakness in the real could continue to adversely impact our financial results. 15 table of contents our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued. we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2015 , our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $13.4 million compared to a net liability of $92.5 million at december 31, 2014 . the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. commodity price risk energy costs are diversified among coal, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged energy exposure vs. energy market pricing (in millions) net asset / (liability)

$(1.1) $(2.9) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2014 $(7.3) $(5.3) $(9.4) our fmc agricultural solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans. to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts, we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 our net financial instrument position was immaterial. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the chinese yuan, the brazilian real and the argentine peso. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2015 and 2014 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged currency vs. functional currency (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% strengthening net asset / (liability) position with 10% weakening net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2015 $(11.4) $24.4 $(47.2) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2014 (1) $(85.2) $91.3 $(261.0) ______________ (1) includes the unrealized loss on hedging the purchase price of cheminova as of december 31, 2014 . see "cheminova acquisition hedge costs" in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k. 43 table of contents interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , we had no interest rate swap agreements. our debt portfolio at december 31, 2015 is composed of 56 percent fixed-rate debt and 44 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our term loan facility, commercial paper program, credit facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2015 , a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $9.6 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $3.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2015 .risk factors 11 risk factors below lists our risk factors updated for these events. among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization - our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. competition - all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. competition for our fmc agricultural solutions business, includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. also, there are changing competitive dynamics in the agro-chemical industry as some of our competitors are attempting to consolidate, resulting in them having greater scale and diversity. these competitive differences may not be overcome and erode our business. changes in our customer base - our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our fmc lithium and fmc health and nutrition businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions - our fmc agricultural solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations; for example, drought may reduce the need for fungicides, which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market, whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease 11 table of contents or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment - changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china, argentina and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our fmc agricultural solutions business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely. geographic concentration - although we have operations in most regions, the majority of our fmc agricultural solutions sales outside the united states have principally been to customers in latin america, including brazil, argentina and mexico. with the acquisition of cheminova, we are expanding our international sales, particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india. accordingly, developments in those parts of the world will generally have a more significant effect on our operations. our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. food and pharmaceutical regulation - some of our manufacturing processes and facilities, as well as some of our customers, are subject to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. consumer preferences - changing consumer preferences is a risk particularly within fmc health and nutrition. any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and impact our results of operations. climate change regulation - changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations. fluctuations in commodity prices - our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities, including raw materials. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in commodity pricing. accordingly, increases in commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. we also use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. however, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. additionally, fluctuations in commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers' abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables. supply arrangements - certain raw materials are critical to our production process. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, largely outside of the u.s. and principally in china. an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. in fmc lithium, geological conditions can affect production of raw materials. economic and political change - our business has been and could continue be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by the united states government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within the united states and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, 12 table of contents price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business. operational risks: market access risk - our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. business disruptions - although more recently, fmc agricultural solutions has engaged in pesticide active ingredient contract manufacturing rather than owned and operated manufacturing facilities, we now own and operate large-scale manufacturing facilities in denmark and india as a result of the cheminova acquisition. this presents us with additional operating risks as our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the various acquired production facilities and the ability to manufacture products on schedule. interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties. although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of contaminated or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities. information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties' intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation, violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions, and also potentially result in liability to us. this could damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. capital-intensive business - with the acquisition of cheminova, our business is more capital intensive than it has been historically. we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results. credit default risks - we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. litigation and environmental risks - current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials - we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance - we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. we may 13 table of contents face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. workforce - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization. we operate in markets where business ethics and local customs may differ from our standards, increasing the potential for the misunderstanding or misapplication of those standards. this may increase the risk of noncompliance. technology risks: technological change - our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. failure to make process improvements - failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. patents of competitors - some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively. portfolio management and integration risks: portfolio management risks - we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets (e.g., divesting) may affect the company's earnings. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. continuing integration challenges - failure to successfully integrate the operating and financial systems of cheminova into our systems poses technology integration risks and could result in our inability to achieve the synergies we have projected. this could thereby cause our future results of operations to be materially and adversely worse than expected. as we evaluate and adjust our supply chain as part of integrating cheminova to achieve synergies and efficiencies, we face execution and sustainability risks if we are unable to modify and timely execute the supply chain as planned. financial risks: exposure to global economic conditions - deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, particularly latin american regions, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. the ongoing economic challenges in brazil has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business there. foreign exchange rate risks - we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real, the euro, the chinese yuan, the mexican peso, and the argentine peso. our acquisition of cheminova has significantly expanded our operations and sales in foreign countries and correspondingly increased our exposure to foreign exchange risks. during 2015, adverse changes in the brazilian real exchange rate adversely impacted our financial results and continued weakness in the real could continue to adversely impact our financial results. uncertain tax rates - our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued. 14 table of contents uncertain recoverability of investments in long-lived assets - we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. pension and postretirement plans - obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2016 , our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $2.5 million compared to a net liability of $13.4 million at december 31, 2015 . the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. commodity price risk energy costs are diversified among coal, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2016 and 2015 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged energy exposure vs. energy market pricing (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% increase net asset / (liability) position with 10% decrease net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2016 $2.0 $3.3 $0.8 net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2015 $(2.0) $(1.1) $(2.9) foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the chinese yuan, the brazilian real and the argentine peso. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2016 and 2015 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged currency vs. functional currency (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% strengthening net asset / (liability)

the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , we had no interest rate swap agreements. 43 table of contents our debt portfolio at december 31, 2016 is composed of 58.9 percent fixed-rate debt and 41.1 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our term loan facility, commercial paper program, credit facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2016 , a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 7.8 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 6.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 .risk factors 10 risk factors below lists our risk factors updated for these events. among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization - our lithium business is sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within the industry. competition - all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. competition for our fmc agricultural solutions business, includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients, but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries, and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. also, there are changing competitive dynamics in the agro-chemical industry as some of our competitors are attempting to consolidate, resulting in them having greater scale and diversity. these competitive differences may not be overcome and erode our business. changes in our customer base - our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our fmc lithium business is most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions - our fmc agricultural solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations; for example, drought may reduce the need for fungicides, which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market, whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment - changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china, argentina and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our fmc agricultural solutions business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely. geographic concentration - although we have operations in most regions, the majority of our fmc agricultural solutions sales outside the united states have principally been to customers in latin america, including brazil, argentina and mexico. with the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business, we are expanding our international sales, particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india. accordingly, developments in those parts of the world will generally have a more significant effect on our operations. our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. pharmaceutical regulation - our lithium facility in bessemer city, north carolina, and some of our manufacturing processes at that facility, as well as some of our customers, are subject to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. 10 table of contents climate change regulation - changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations. fluctuations in commodity prices - our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities, including raw materials. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in commodity pricing. accordingly, increases in commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. however, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. additionally, fluctuations in commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers' abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables. supply arrangements - certain raw materials are critical to our production processes. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, largely outside of the u.s. and principally in china. an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. economic and political change - our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by the united states government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within the united states and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business. realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses. in china, unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns of manufacturing activity in broad geographic areas due to non-attainment across the entire area rather than specific infractions or actions of individual producers, impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers. operational risks: market access risk - our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. business disruptions - as a part of the dupont crop protection integration we now own and operate large-scale manufacturing facilities in the united states (mobile), puerto rico (manati) and china (pudong and jinshan) in addition to our legacy active ingredient plants in denmark (ronland) and india (panoli). this presents us with additional operating risks as our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the various acquired production facilities and the ability to manufacture products on schedule. interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties. although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of contaminated or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities. information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties' intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation, violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions, 11 table of contents and also potentially result in liability to us. this could damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. capital-intensive business - with the acquisition of dupont crop protection assets and the planned continued expansion of our lithium business, our business is more capital intensive than it has been historically. we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results. credit default risks - we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. litigation and environmental risks - current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials - we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance - we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. compliance with laws and regulations: the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage, which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards. workforce - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization. technology risks: technological change - our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients for fmc agricultural solutions relies on discovery of new chemical molecules. such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules, which are novel and outside of patents held by others, and such molecules being efficacious against target pests without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment, and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria. failure to make process improvements - failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. patents of competitors - some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively. portfolio management and integration risks: portfolio management risks - we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our 12 table of contents financial results. in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets (e.g., divesting) may affect the company's earnings. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. continuing integration challenges - failure to successfully integrate the acquired dupont business and transition the management information systems of the dupont business from the erp system provided under transition services agreement by dupont to a management information system integrated with fmc's legacy products could result in interruption of operations or failure to achieve synergies we expect. this could cause our future results of operations to be materially worse than expected. fmc lithium separation challenges - we are separating our fmc lithium business at that same time as we continue to integrate the dupont assets into fmc agricultural solutions as well as implement other major initiatives such as the migration to a single global instance of sap s4 hana. these three projects will place significant demands on certain functions who are heavily involved in all three projects, particularly finance and information technology. failure to successfully execute such projects could materially and adversely affect our expected performance in fmc agricultural solutions and/or fmc lithium. financial risks: exposure to global economic conditions - deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. foreign exchange rate risks - we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real, the euro, the chinese yuan, the mexican peso, and the argentine peso. our acquisition of dupont crop protection business has significantly expanded our operations and sales in certain foreign countries and correspondingly may increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks. uncertain tax rates - our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued. uncertain recoverability of investments in long-lived assets - we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. pension and postretirement plans - obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2017 , our net financial instrument position was a net asset of $4.4 million compared to a net liability of $2.5 million at december 31, 2016 . the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. commodity price risk energy costs are diversified among coal, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2017 and 2016 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged energy exposure vs. energy market pricing (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% increase net asset / (liability) position with 10% decrease net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2017 $ $ $ net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2016 $2.0 $3.3 $0.8 foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the chinese yuan, the brazilian real and the argentine peso. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2017 and 2016 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged currency vs. functional currency (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% strengthening net asset / (liability) position with 10% weakening net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2017 $4.4 $10.8 $(3.2) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2016 $(4.5) $31.9 $(39.0) interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , we had no interest rate swap agreements. our debt portfolio at december 31, 2017 is composed of 38 percent fixed-rate debt and 62 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities, commercial paper program, credit facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. 38 table of contents based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2017 , a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $19.7 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $19.7 million for the year ended december 31, 2017 .risk factors 10 risk factors below lists our risk factors updated for these events. among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization - our fmc lithium segment is sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within the industry. competition - all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. competition for our fmc agricultural solutions segment includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. also, there are changing competitive dynamics in the agrochemical industry as some of our competitors have consolidated, resulting in them having greater scale and diversity. these competitive differences may not be overcome and may erode our business. changes in our customer base - our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our fmc lithium segment is most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions - our fmc agricultural solutions markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. for example, drought may reduce the need for fungicides, which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market, whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides. adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment - changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states, brazil, china, argentina and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. our fmc agricultural solutions segment is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which affects each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind the reach regulation is that manufacturers must verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely. geographic presence outside of united states - with the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business, fmc agricultural solutions has a strong presence in latin america, europe and asia, as well as in the united states. growth of our geographic footprint particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india means that developments outside the united states will generally have a more significant effect on our operations than in the past. our operations outside the united states are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control 10 table of contents regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. pharmaceutical regulation - our fmc lithium facility in bessemer city, north carolina, and some of our manufacturing processes at that facility, as well as some of our customers, are subject to regulation by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and u.s. department of agriculture (usda) or similar foreign agencies. regulatory requirements of the fda and usda are complex, and any failure to comply with them including as a result of contamination due to acts of sabotage could subject us and/or our customers to fines, injunctions, civil penalties, lawsuits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial of government approvals, withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution. any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales, undermine goodwill established with our customers, damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations. climate change regulation - changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations. fluctuations in commodity prices - our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in chemical raw material commodity pricing. accordingly, increases in such commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. however, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. additionally, fluctuations in harvested crop commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers' abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables. supply arrangements - certain raw materials are critical to our production processes and our purchasing strategy and supply chain design are complex. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and could lead to operational disruption and increase uncertainties around business performance. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, largely outside of the u.s. and principally in china. an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. economic and political change - our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, tariff increases or potential new tariffs, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by the united states government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within the united states and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business. realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses. in china, unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns in broad geographic areas, impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers. operational risks: market access risk - our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. business disruptions - we produce product through a combination of owned facilities and contract manufacturers. as a result of the dupont crop protection acquisition we now own and operate large-scale manufacturing facilities in the united states (mobile), puerto rico (manati) and china (pudong and jinshan) in addition to our legacy active ingredient plants in denmark (ronland) and india (panoli). this presents us with additional operating risks as our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the acquired production facilities. interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity of a particular manufacturing facility, or the profitability of our business as a whole. although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic 11 table of contents or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of contaminated or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, pandemic situations and large scale power outages. some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities. information technology security risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties' intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation, violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions, and also potentially result in liability to us. while we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with the european union's general data protection regulation and other data privacy regulations, these measures may be challenged by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. we could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines or penalties. this could damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. litigation and environmental risks - current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials - we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance - we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. compliance with laws and regulations: the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage, which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards. workforce - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization. technology risks: technological change - our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients for fmc agricultural solutions relies on discovery of new chemical molecules. such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules, which are novel and outside of patents held by others, and such molecules being efficacious against target pests without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment, and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria. failure to make process improvements - failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. patents of competitors - some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively. portfolio management and integration risks: portfolio management risks - we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. failure to achieve these anticipated synergies, could materially and adversely affect our financial results. in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such 12 table of contents assets (e.g., divesting) may affect the company's earnings. moreover, we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. significant effort will likely be required to ensure that the right mix of resources are trained, engaged and focused on achieving business objectives while adhering to our core values of safety, ethics and compliance. intellectual property - our patents cover many of our products, manufacturing processes, and product uses, as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting our new product pipeline. patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities. our future performance will depend on our ability to address patent expirations through effective portfolio life cycle management for our high value assets. system implementation and integration risks - failure to successfully integrate the acquired dupont crop protection business and transition the management information systems of the dupont crop protection business from the erp system provided under transition services agreement by dupont to a management information system integrated with fmc's legacy processes could result in interruption of operations or failure to achieve synergies we expect. this could cause our future results of operations to be materially worse than expected. major enterprise initiatives - we are working to spin off our fmc lithium segment in parallel to the continued integration of the dupont crop protection business assets into fmc agricultural solutions as well as implement other major initiatives such as the migration to a single global instance of sap s4 hana. these three projects will place significant demands on certain functions who are heavily involved in all three projects, particularly finance and information technology. failure to successfully execute such projects could materially and adversely affect our expected performance in fmc agricultural solutions and/or fmc lithium. potential tax implications of fmc lithium separation - we have received an opinion from outside counsel to the effect that the spin-off of fmc lithium as a distribution to our stockholders qualifies as a non-taxable transaction for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from both fmc and fmc lithium, as well as certain covenants by those parties. the opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect. the opinion of counsel is not binding upon the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. it is possible that the irs or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that aforementioned transaction results in the recognition of significant taxable gain by fmc, in which case fmc may be subject to material tax liabilities. financial risks: cyclicality - we may experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products given the nature of the crop protection market and the geographic regions in which we operate. access to debt and capital markets - we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and working capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results. credit default risks - we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. exposure to global economic conditions - deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect both our own and our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. 13 table of contents foreign exchange rate risks - we are an international company and face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real, the euro, the indian rupee, the chinese yuan, the mexican peso, and the argentine peso. our acquisition of the dupont crop protection business has significantly expanded our operations and sales in certain foreign countries and correspondingly may increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks. uncertain tax rates - our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at different rates than the united states federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; currency gains and losses; and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued. uncertain recoverability of investments in long-lived assets - we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. pension and postretirement plans - obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2018 , our net financial instrument position was a net asset of $10.2 million compared to a net asset of $4.4 million at december 31, 2017 . the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. commodity price risk energy costs are diversified among coal, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we perform a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. note, as of december 31, 2018 and december 31, 2017 , we had no open commodity contracts. as a result, there was no sensitivity analysis performed over commodity price risk for the periods presented. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the chinese yuan, the brazilian real and the argentine peso. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2018 and 2017 , with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged currency vs. functional currency (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% strengthening net asset / (liability) position with 10% weakening net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2018 $ 10.4 $ 28.4 $ (31.0 ) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2017 $ 4.4 $ 10.8 $ (3.2 ) interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. in the quarter ended december 31, 2018 , we had outstanding contracts in place to swap portions of our variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt with an aggregate notional value of $200.0 million . there were no interest rate swap agreements as of december 31, 2017. to analyze the effects of changing interest rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous one percent change in the interest rates from their levels at december 31, 2018 , with all other variables held constant. (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on condensed consolidated balance sheets 1% increase 1% decrease net asset (liability) position at december 31, 2018 $ (0.2 ) $ 2.2 $ (2.7 ) our debt portfolio at december 31, 2018 is composed of 52 percent fixed-rate debt and 48 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2017 term loan facility, commercial paper 42 table of contents program, credit facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2018 , a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $13.2 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $13.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2018 .risk factors 10 risk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: competition and new agricultural technologies - our business faces competition, which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices, successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. competition for our business includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds. increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade, and this trend is expected to continue. also, there are changing competitive dynamics in the agrochemical industry as some of our competitors have consolidated, resulting in them having greater scale and diversity, as well as market reach. these competitive differences may not be overcome and may erode our business. agriculture in many countries is changing and new technologies (e.g., precision pest prediction or application, data management) continue to emerge. at this time, the scope and potential impact of these technologies are largely unknown but could have the potential to disrupt our business. climatic conditions - our markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. for example, drought may reduce the need for fungicides, which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market, whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides. drought and/or increased temperatures may change insect pest pressures, requiring growers to use more, less, or different insecticides. natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. cyclicality - while our business is well balanced geographically, in any given calendar quarter a certain geography(ies) will predominate in light of seasonal variations in the demand for our products given the nature of the crop protection market and the geographic regions in which we operate. unexpected market conditions in that predominating geography(ies), such as adverse weather, pest pressures, or other risks described herein, may impact our business if occurring during a calendar quarter in which such geography(ies) is predominating. changing regulatory environment and public perception - changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the u.s., brazil, china, india, argentina and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue producing and/or selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so. additionally, changes to the regulatory environment may be influenced by non-government public pressure as a result of negative perception regarding the use of our crop protection products. we are sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products. many countries require re-registration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements; while we defend our products vigorously, these re-registration processes may result in significant additional data costs, reduced number of permitted product uses, or potential product cancellation. compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which requires manufacturers to verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely. geographic presence outside of u.s. - we have a strong presence in latin america, europe and asia, as well as in the u.s. growth of our geographic footprint particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india means that developments outside the u.s. will generally have a more significant effect on our operations than in the past. our operations outside the u.s. are subject to special risks and restrictions, including: fluctuations in currency values; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions or tariffs; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting u.s. companies doing business abroad. climate change and government regulation of greenhouse gases - the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels, drought, flooding and general volatility in seasonal temperatures could adversely affect our operations globally. extreme weather events attributable to climate change may result in, among other things, physical damage to our property and equipment, and interruptions to our supply chain. climate change may also impact markets in which we sell our products, where, for example, a prolonged drought may result in decreased demand for our products. the more gradual effects of persistent temperature change in geographies with significant agricultural lands may result in changes in lands suitable for agriculture or changes in the mix of crops suitable for cultivation and the pests that may be present in such geographies. for example, prolonged increase in average temperature may make northern lands suitable for growing crops not grown historically in such climes, leading farmers to shift from crops such as wheat to 10 table of contents soybean and may result in new or different weed, plant disease or insect pressures on such crops such changes would impact the mix of pesticide products farmers would purchase, which may be adverse for us, depending on the local market and our product mix. additionally, changes in the governmental regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations. fluctuations in commodity prices - our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities - both chemical raw material commodities and harvested crop commodities. we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in chemical raw material commodity pricing. accordingly, increases in such commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results. we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks, where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms. however, we are unable to avoid the risk of medium- and long-term increases. additionally, fluctuations in harvested crop commodity prices could negatively impact our customers' ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity. inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers' abilities to pay for our products and, therefore, affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables. supply arrangements - certain raw materials are critical to our production processes and our purchasing strategy and supply chain design are complex. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and could lead to operational disruption and increase uncertainties around business performance. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, largely outside of the u.s. and principally in china. an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. economic and political change - our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, tariff increases or potential new tariffs, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the u.s. or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in laws, taxation, and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws, taxes, and regulations; restrictions imposed by the u.s. government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy; nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights, and legal systems or political instability; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. economic and political conditions within the u.s. and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. in argentina, continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business. realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses. in china, unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns in broad geographic areas, impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers. operational risks: market access risk - our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. business disruptions - we produce products through a combination of owned facilities and contract manufacturers. we own and operate large-scale active ingredient manufacturing facilities in the u.s. (mobile), puerto rico (manati), china (pudong and jinshan), denmark (ronland), and india (panoli). our operating results are dependent in part on the continued operation of these production facilities. interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity of a particular manufacturing facility, or the profitability of our business as a whole. although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions, our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. these potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties, information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of contaminated or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, large scale power outages and public health epidemics/pandemics. some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities. further, outbreaks of pandemics such as the covid-19 (wuhan) coronavirus currently impacting china and other countries, or the fear of such events, could provoke responses, including government imposed travel restrictions, which may impact: access to our production sites, the ability of raw material suppliers to produce and deliver goods to us, our ability to ship our products to production, warehousing or customer sites, or the ability of our sales organization to make sales or for customers (or indirect customers such as farmers) to purchase our products. 11 table of contents litigation and environmental risks - current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials - we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment, they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us. environmental compliance - we are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, emissions in the air, discharges to land and water, and the generation, handling, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials. we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business, including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture, handle or own. we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. compliance with laws and regulations - the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage, which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards. workforce - the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. in addition, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization. technology risks: information technology security and data privacy risks - as with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties' intent on extracting information, corrupting information, deploying ransomware, or disrupting business processes. our systems have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems, lockout from systems due to ransomware, or in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation, violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions, and also potentially result in a liability. while we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with the european union's general data protection regulation and data privacy regulations in other countries, these measures may be challenged by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. we could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines or penalties. this could damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations. technological and new product discovery/development - our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative, high value-added products for existing and future customers. our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients relies on discovery of new chemical molecules or biological strains. such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules and strains, which are novel and outside of patents held by others, and such molecules/strains being efficacious against target pests, and our ability to develop those molecules and strains into new products without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment, and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria. the timeline from active ingredient discovery through full development and product launch averages 8-10 years depending on local regulatory requirements; the complexity and duration of developing new products create risks that product concepts may fail during development or, when launched, may not meet then-current market needs or competitive conditions. portfolio management and integration risks: portfolio management risks - we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives. if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses, we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth. failure to achieve these anticipated synergies could materially and adversely affect our financial results. in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy. in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets. the gains or losses on the divestiture of, or lost operating income from, such assets (e.g., divesting) may affect the company's earnings. moreover, we may incur asset 12 table of contents impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings. significant effort will likely be required to ensure that the right mix of resources are trained, engaged and focused on achieving business objectives while adhering to our core values of safety, ethics and compliance. innovation and intellectual property - our innovation efforts are protected by patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that cover many of our current products, manufacturing processes, and product uses, as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting our new product pipeline. trademarks protect valuable brands associated with our products. patents and trademarks are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities. our future performance will depend on our ability to address active ingredient composition of matter patent expirations through effective enforcement of our patents that continue to cover key chemical intermediates and process patents, as well as portfolio life cycle management, particularly for our high value diamide insecticides (see "diamide growth strategy" and "patents, trademarks and licenses" in item 1 for more details). if our innovation efforts fail to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs, such conditions could impede our competitive position. some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete cost-effectively. enforcement of intellectual property rights - the composition of matter patents on our rynaxypyr active ingredient is nearing its expiration in several key countries. we have a broad estate of additional patents regarding the production of rynaxypyr active ingredient, as well as trademark and data exclusivity protection in certain countries that extend well beyond the active ingredient composition of matter patents. (see "diamide growth strategy" and "patents, trademarks and licenses" in item 1). we intend to strategically and vigorously enforce our patents and other forms of intellectual property and have done so already against several third parties. other third parties may seek to enter markets with infringing products or may find alternative production methods that avoid infringement or we may not be successful in litigating to enforce our patents due to the risks inherent in any litigation. patents involve complex factual and legal issues and, thus, the scope, validity or enforceability of any patent claims we have or may obtain cannot be clearly predicted. patents may be challenged in the courts, as well as in various administrative proceedings before u.s. or foreign patent offices, and may be deemed unenforceable, invalidated or circumvented. we are currently and may in the future be a party to various lawsuits or administrative proceedings involving our patents. such challenges can result in some or all of the claims of the asserted patent being invalidated or deemed unenforceable. in such circumstances, an adverse patent enforcement decision which could lead to the entry of competing chlorantraniliprole products in relevant markets may materially and adversely impact our financial results. system implementation and integration risks - failure to successfully integrate the acquired dupont crop protection business and transition the management information systems of the dupont crop protection business from the erp system provided under transition services agreement by dupont to a management information system integrated with fmc's legacy processes could result in interruption of operations or failure to achieve synergies we expect. this could cause our future results of operations to be materially worse than expected. major enterprise initiatives - in addition to the continued integration of the dupont crop protection business assets, we are implementing other major initiatives such as the migration to a single global instance of sap s/4 hana. these projects will place significant demands on certain of our internal functional groups, particularly finance and information technology. failure to successfully execute these projects could materially and adversely affect our expected performance. potential tax implications of fmc lithium separation - we have received an opinion from outside counsel to the effect that the spin-off of fmc lithium as a distribution to our stockholders qualified as a non-taxable transaction for u.s. federal income tax purposes. the opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from both fmc and fmc lithium, as well as certain covenants by those parties. the opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect. the opinion of counsel is not binding upon the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position. it is possible that the irs or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that aforementioned transaction results in the recognition of significant taxable gain by fmc, in which case fmc may be subject to material tax liabilities. 13 table of contents financial risks: access to debt and capital markets - we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and working capital needs. limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results. moreover, interest payments, dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future. however, if we need external financing, our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally. there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results. credit default risks - we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs, to the extent available. in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes, we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports, which we may not be able to do. any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments. without waivers from lenders party to those agreements, any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate. exposure to global economic conditions - deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business. a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect both our own and our customers' ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers' ability to perform all their commitments to us. a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets, or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers, suppliers and our overall business there. customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. foreign exchange rate risks - we are an international company operating in many countries around the world, and thus face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business. we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real, the euro, the indian rupee, the chinese yuan, the mexican peso, the argentine peso and the u.s. dollar. while we engage in hedging and other strategies to mitigate those risks, unexpected severe changes in foreign exchange may create risks that could materially and adversely affect our expected performance. uncertain tax rates - our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions, as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at different statutory rates than the u.s. federal statutory rate; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowance; changes in tax law; currency gains and losses. uncertain recoverability of investments in long-lived assets - we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. we may recognize future impairments of long-lived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations. pension and postretirement plans - obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this, we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. at december 31, 2019, our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $8.9 million compared to a net asset of $11.4 million at december 31, 2018. the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio. since our risk management programs are generally highly effective, the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the chinese yuan, the brazilian real, mexican peso, indian rupee and the argentine peso. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2019 and 2018, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. hedged currency vs. functional currency (in millions) net asset / (liability) position on consolidated balance sheets net asset / (liability) position with 10% strengthening net asset / (liability) position with 10% weakening net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2019 $ (8.0) $ 55.9 $ (75.4) net asset/(liability) position at december 31, 2018 11.6 19.2 (16.7) interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. in the quarter ended december 31, 2019, we had outstanding contracts in place to swap portions of our variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt with an aggregate notional value of $200.0 million. to analyze the effects of changing interest rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous one percent change in the interest rates from their levels at december 31, 2019 and 2018, with all other variables held constant.

position at december 31, 2018 (0.2) 2.2 (2.7) our debt portfolio at december 31, 2019 is composed of 80 percent fixed-rate debt and 20 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2017 term loan facility, credit facility, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2019, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by $6.4 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by $6.4 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. 44 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market-value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using third-party software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (spot and forward foreign exchange rates) as of the valuation date. we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party. at december 31, 2004, our net financial instrument position of interest rate swaps and currency and energy hedges was a net liability of $5.4 million compared to a net asset of $1.1 million at december 31, 2003. the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized losses in our foreign currency portfolio. commodity price risk energy costs are approximately 10 percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal, electricity and natural gas, and to a lesser extent, oil. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas and oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003 with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of $10.6 million and $9.0 million at december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, respectively. a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of $10.7 million and $8.5 million in the net asset position and as a result would change the net asset position into a net liability position at december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, respectively. 44 table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the euro versus the norwegian krone, the u.s. dollar versus the japanese yen and the u.s. dollar versus the brazilian real. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects

31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in an increase of $19.9 million and $16.2 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, respectively. a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of $18.9 million and $15.6 million in the net liability position and as a result would change the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31, 2004 and december 31, 2003, respectively. interest rate risk one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in the agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. in the first quarter of 2003, we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of $100.0 million. these swaps, in which we exchange net amounts based on making payments derived from a floating-rate index and receiving payments on a fixed-rate basis, are used to hedge our 10.25 percent senior secured notes due 2009. interest rate swaps that meet specific conditions under sfas no. 133 are accounted for as fair-value hedges. the termination liability of these interest rate swap agreements at december 31, 2004 was $1.2 million. the net termination position was not material at december 31, 2003. all existing fair-value hedges are 100 percent effective. as a result, there is no effect on earnings from hedge ineffectiveness. our debt portfolio, including interest rate swap agreements, at december 31, 2004 is composed of 70 percent fixed-rate debt and 30 percent variable-rate debt compared to 62 percent fixed-rate debt and 38 percent variable-rate debt at december 31, 2003. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of bank borrowings, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and interest rate swap agreements entered into in the first quarter of 2003 with an aggregate notional principal amount of $100.0 million. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt, including interest rate swap agreements, in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2004 and 2003, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates in 2004 and 2003 would increase or decrease net income by $2.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. 45 table of contentsrisk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization our industrial chemicals businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. 18 table of contents competition all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to raise prices or successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. additionally in agricultural products, competition from generic producers has increased as a number of significant product patents have expired in the last decade. changes in our customer base our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions our agricultural products markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely affect crop pricing and pest infestations. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states and the european union could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets. raw materials and energy costs our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to fully offset the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs through price increases or productivity improvements. supply arrangements certain raw materials are critical to our production process, especially in agricultural products and specialty chemicals, and while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements an inability to obtain these critical raw materials would adversely impact our ability to produce product. unforeseen economic and political change our business could be adversely affected by unforeseen economic and political changes in the international markets where we compete including: war, terrorism, civil unrest, inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; change in governmental laws and regulations and the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. market access risk our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. in certain agricultural product segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which we do not have majority control. where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios. litigation and environmental risks current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may prove inadequate. hazardous materials we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature and while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner if they are mishandled or released into the environment it could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us. production hazards our facilities are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business. technology risks: failure to make continued improvements in our product technology and new product introductions could impede our competitive position, particularly in agricultural products and specialty chemicals. failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. 19 table of contents financial risks: we are an international company and therefore face foreign exchange rate risks. we are particularly sensitive to the euro and the brazilian real. to a lesser extent, we are sensitive to asian currencies, particularly the japanese yen. in brazil our customers face a combination of economic factors that could result in cash flow pressures that lead to slower payments. we have significant deferred income tax assets. the carrying value of these assets is dependent upon, among other things, our future performance and our ability to successfully implement our tax planning strategies. we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. our results incorporate the financial performance of our equity affiliates. as such, our influence, though significant, is exercised in concert with our partners; accordingly, the performance of these investments is not under our control. obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly.

which could adversely affect crop pricing and pest infestations. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets. our agricultural products business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the new chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which will affect each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind this regulation is that manufacturers must verify that their chemicals can be marketed safely through a special registration system. climate change regulation changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations, particularly certain industrial chemicals operations in the united states, to additional costs or limits on operations. raw materials and energy costs our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to fully offset the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs through price increases or productivity improvements. supply arrangements/chain/production hazards certain raw materials are critical to our production process, especially in agricultural products and specialty chemicals, and while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or execute under the contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce product. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, especially in agricultural products. an inability to obtain these products or execute under the contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell product. our facilities and those of our key contract manufacturers are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business. economic and political change our business could be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: war, terrorism, civil unrest, inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign

increase of $17.9 million in the net asset position at december 31, 2006. as a result, at december 31, 2007, the net liability position would become a net asset position. 47 table of contents interest rate risk one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements. in these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreed-upon notional principal amount. in 2003, we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of $100.0 million. in 2005, we terminated these swaps at a net cost of $2.7 million and redeemed the underlying debt. as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, we had no interest rate swap agreements. our debt portfolio, at december 31, 2007, is composed of 52 percent fixed-rate debt and 48 percent variable-rate debt. the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of foreign bank borrowings including borrowings under our european credit agreement and, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2007, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates then in effect would have increased or decreased gross interest expense for 2007 by $2.6 million. 48 table of contentsrisk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: worldwide recession and disruption of financial markets: the recent worldwide financial and credit market disruptions have reduced the availability of liquidity and credit generally necessary to fund a continuation and expansion of global economic activity. the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in equity markets has led to a worldwide economic recession that could become prolonged. the general slowdown in economic activity caused by an extended recession could adversely affect our business. a continuation or worsening of the current difficult financial and economic conditions could adversely affect our customers ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers ability to fully perform their commitments to us. industry risks: pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including: capacity utilization our businesses are sensitive to industry capacity utilization, particularly in our industrial chemicals business. as a result, pricing tends to fluctuate when capacity utilization changes occur within our industry. competition all of our segments face competition, which could affect our ability to raise prices or successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position. additionally, in agricultural products, competition from genetically modified products (gmo) as well as generic producers has increased. generics are driven by the number of significant product patents that have expired in the last decade. changes in our customer base our customer base has the potential to change, especially when long-term supply contracts are renegotiated. our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals businesses are most sensitive to this risk. climatic conditions our agricultural products markets are affected by climatic conditions, which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations. the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict. changing regulatory environment changes in the regulatory environment, particularly in the united states and the european union, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets. our agricultural products business is most sensitive to this general regulatory risk. in the european union, the regulatory risk specifically includes the new chemicals regulation known as reach (registration, evaluation, and authorization of chemicals), which will affect each of our business segments to varying degrees. the fundamental principle behind this regulation is that manufacturers must verify that their chemicals can be marketed safely through a special registration system. 18 table of contents climate change regulation changes in the regulation of greenhouse gases, depending on their nature and scope, could subject our manufacturing operations, particularly certain industrial chemicals operations in the united states, to additional costs or limits on operations. raw materials and energy costs our operating results are significantly affected by the cost of raw materials and energy, including natural gas. we may not be able to fully offset the impact of higher raw materials and energy costs through price increases or productivity improvements. supply arrangements and production hazards certain raw materials are critical to our production process, especially in our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments. while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements, an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or execute under the contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products. we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers, especially in agricultural products. an inability to obtain these products or execute under the contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products. our facilities and those of our key contract manufacturers are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business. economic and political change our business could be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including: war, terrorism, civil unrest, inflation rates, recessions, trade restrictions, foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business; change in governmental laws and regulations and the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations; other governmental actions; and other external factors over which we have no control. market access risk our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels, which could impact our ability to access the market. in certain agricultural products segments, we access the market through joint ventures in which we do not have majority control. where we do not have a strong product portfolio or market access relationships, we may be vulnerable to changes in the distribution model or influence of competitors with stronger product portfolios. litigation and environmental risks current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate. hazardous materials we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature. while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner, if they are mishandled or released into the environment they could cause property damage or personal injury claims against us. technology risks: failure to make continued improvements in our product technology and new product introductions could impede our competitive position, particularly in agricultural products and specialty chemicals. failure to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs could impede our competitive position. financial risks: we are an international company and therefore face foreign exchange rate risks. we are particularly sensitive to the euro, the chinese yuan, and the brazilian real. to a lesser extent, we are sensitive to other asian currencies, particularly the japanese yen. in brazil, our customers face a combination of economic factors that could result in cash flow pressures that lead to slower payments. 19 table of contents we have significant deferred income tax assets. the carrying value of these assets is dependent upon, among other things, our future performance and our ability to successfully implement our future business plans. we have significant investments in long-lived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities. our results incorporate the financial performance of our equity affiliates. as such, our influence, though significant, is exercised in concert with our partners; accordingly, the performance of these investments is not under our control. obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions. to the extent our plans actual experience differs from these assumptions, our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity, interest and currency exchange rates. to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions. the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one-year period. market-value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen. we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using third-party software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions (spot and forward foreign exchange rates) as of the valuation date. we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party. at december 31, 2008, our net financial instrument position was a net liability of $39.9 million compared to a net liability of $3.2 million at december 31, 2007. the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to higher unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios. commodity price risk energy costs are approximately 13 percent of our costs of sales and services and are well balanced among coal, electricity and natural gas. we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixed-price contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil. to analyze the effect of changing energy prices, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31, 2008 and december 31, 2007 with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease of the net liability position of $7.6 million at december 31, 2008 compared to a $9.7 million decrease in the net liability position at december 31, 2007. as a result, at december 31, 2007, the net liability position would have become a net asset position. a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of $7.6 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2008 compared to an increase of $9.7 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2007. foreign currency exchange rate risk the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the u.s. dollar versus the euro, the u.s. dollar versus the chinese yuan and the u.s. dollar versus the brazilian real. foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates, we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31, 2008 and december 31, 2007, with all other variables (including interest rates) held constant. a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of $10.9 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2008. a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of $17.6 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2007. a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of $11.8 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2008, compared to a decrease of $17.6 million in the net liability position at december 31, 2007. as a result, at december 31, 2007, the net liability position would have become a net asset position. 50 table of contents interest rate risk one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap

the variable-rate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our domestic and european credit agreements, variable-rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds, and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines. changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variable-rate debt portfolio in different ways. based on the variable-rate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31, 2008, a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates then in effect would have increased or decreased gross interest expense for 2008 by $4.2 million. 51 table of contentsrisk factors among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are: worldwide recession and disruption of
