( numonyx ), which manufactures and sells nor flash, nand flash, dram and phase change memory technologies and products. we acquired numonyx in a stock-for-stock transaction to further strengthen our portfolio of memory products, increase manufacturing and revenue scale, access numonyx's customer base and provide opportunities to increase multi-chip offerings in the embedded and mobile markets. (see item 8. financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements numonyx holdings b.v. note.) all other: operating results of all other primarily reflect activity of our wafer manufacturing operations for cmos image sensors and also include activity of our microdisplay, solar and other operations. we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina imaging corporation ( aptina ), which is 35% owned by us, under a wafer supply agreement. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements supplemental balance sheet information equity method investments aptina note.) products memory: sales of memory products were 88%, 89% and 89% of our total net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. dynamic random access memory ( dram ) : dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval. dram products were 60%, 50% and 54% of our total net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. we offer dram products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics including high-volume ddr3 and ddr2 products as well as specialty dram memory products including ddr, sdram, mobile low power dram, psram and rldram. ddr3 and ddr2: ddr3 and ddr2 are standardized, high-density, high-volume dram products that are sold primarily for use as main system memory in computers and servers. ddr3 and ddr2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost compared to other dram products. ddr3 products were 22% of our total net sales in 2010 as compared to 7% of our total net sales in 2009 and we expect that sales of ddr3 products as a percentage of total net sales will continue to increase in 2011. ddr2 products were 24%, 22% and 28% of our total net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. we offer ddr3 products in 1 gigabit ( gb ) and 2 gb densities and ddr2 products in 256 megabit ( mb ), 512 mb, 1 gb and 2 gb densities. we expect that these densities will be necessary to meet future customer demands for a broad array of products and offer these products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types. in connection with our investment in inotera in 2009, we also offered ddr2 and ddr3 dram products manufactured by inotera using a trench dram technology. as inotera transitioned to our stack dram technology it discontinued wafers starts on trench dram in july of 2010. all wafer starts since that time have been on our stack dram technology. other dram products: we also offer specialty dram memory products including ddr, sdram, ddr and ddr2 mobile low power dram ( lpdram ), pseudo-static ram ( psram ) and reduced latency dram ( rldram ), in densities ranging from 64 mb to 2 gb, which are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment and computer peripherals as well as computer memory upgrades. aggregate sales of these products were 14%, 21% and 25% of our total net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. nand flash memory ( nand ) : nand products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand sales for the memory segment were 28%, 39% and 35% of our total net sales in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. nand is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memory. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash memory cards, are used with applications such as personal computers, digital still cameras, mp3/4 players and mobile phones. embedded nand-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, mp3/4 players, computers, solid-state drives ( ssd's ), tablets and other personal and consumer applications. the market for nand products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to demand for these and other removable and embedded storage devices. 2 dram, nand and nor share common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our nand designs feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we offer single-level cell ( slc ) products and multi-level cell ( mlc ) nand products, which have two or more times the bit density

(see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated variable interest entities nand flash joint ventures with intel note.) 4 (2) tech: we have a dram memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore, tech semiconductor singapore pte. ltd. ( tech ) among us, canon inc. ( canon ) and hewlett-packard company ( hp ). as of september 2, 2010, we owned an approximate 87% interest in tech. subject to specific terms and conditions of the joint venture agreements, we have agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech. tech's semiconductor manufacturing facilities use our product and process technology. the shareholders' agreement for the tech joint venture expires in april 2011. in september 2009, tech received a notice from hp that it does not intend to extend the tech joint venture beyond april 2011. we are in discussions with hp and canon to reach a resolution of this matter. the parties' inability to reach a resolution prior to april 2011 could result in the sale of tech's assets and could require repayment of tech's credit facility ($348 million outstanding as of september 2, 2010). as of september 2, 2010, the carrying value of tech's net assets was $1.1 billion. tech accounted for 45% of our total dram wafer production in 2010, including 48% in the fourth quarter of 2010. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements tech semiconductor singapore pte. ltd. note.) (3) mp mask: we produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask technology center, llc ( mp mask ), a joint venture with photronics, inc. ( photronics ). we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask. mp mask is included in our memory segment. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated variable interest entities mp mask technology center, llc. note.) (4) inotera and meiya: we have partnered with nanya technology corporation ( nanya ) for the design, development and manufacture of stack dram products, including the joint development of dram process technology. in connection therewith, we have partnered with nanya in two taiwan dram memory companies, inotera memories, inc. ( inotera ) and meiya technology corporation ( meiya ). we have a supply agreement with inotera and nanya which gives us the right and obligation to purchase 50% of inotera's semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions. under the formula for this supply agreement, all parties' manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera, as well as our and nanya's selling prices for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera, are considered in determining costs for wafers from inotera. we also partner with nanya to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products. in connection with the partnering agreement, we have also deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of stack dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya. under a cost sharing arrangement effective beginning in april 2010, we generally share dram development costs equally with nanya. in addition, in 2010, we began receiving royalties from nanya for sales of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya with technology developed prior to april 2010. inotera and meiya are included in our memory segment. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity met hod investments inotera and meiya dram joint ventures with nanya note.) (5) transform: on december 18, 2009, we acquired a 50% interest in transform solar pty limited ( transform ), a subsidiary of origin energy limited ( origin ) in exchange for nonmonetary assets with a fair value of $65 million, consisting of manufacturing facilities, equipment, intellectual property and a fully-paid lease to a portion of our boise, idaho manufacturing facilities. transform develops and manufactures photovoltaic solar panels. transform is included in our all other nonreportable segments. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments transform note.) (6) aptina: we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina under a wafer supply agreement. our ownership in aptina constitutes 35% of aptina's total common and preferred stock and 64% of aptina's common stock. aptina is included in our all other nonreportable segments. our investment in aptina is accounted for as an equity method investment, in which we recognize our share of aptina's results of operations based on our 64% share of aptina's common stock. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments aptina note.) 5 manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, israel, italy, japan, malaysia, the philippines, puerto rico and singapore. our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan. our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environmen t. we continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products. in the second half of 2010, most of our dram products were manufactured using our 50nm line-width process technology and we expect to transition our dram production to 42nm line-width process technology in 2011. in 2010 we began transitioning production of our nand flash memory products to our 25nm line-width process technology and expect that most of our nand flash products will be manufactured with this process technology in 2011. in 2010, we manufactured substantially all of our high-volume dram and nand flash products on 300mm wafers. we manufactured nor flash, some specialty dram and cmos image sensor products on 200mm wafers. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. we are able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. after fabrication, most silicon wafers are separated into individual die. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. bare die ) forms. for packaged products, functional die are sorted, connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages. we assemble products in a variety of packages, including tsop (thin small outline package), tqfp (thin quad flat package) and fbga (fine pitch ball grid array). bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility for use in packaging technologies such as systems-in-a-package (sips) and multi-chip packages (mcps), which reduce the board area required. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. we assemble a significant portion of our memory products into memory modules. memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices. we also contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture lexar flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices. we utilize subcontractors to perform a significant portion of our assembly, test and module assembly services. outsourcing these services enables us to reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing process. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. 6 nand flash joint ventures with intel corporation: our im flash joint ventures with intel manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners. we share the output of im flash with intel generally in proportion to their investment in im flash. in the second quarter of 2010, im flash began moving forward with start-up activities in a new singapore wafer fabrication facility, including placing purchase orders and tool installations that commenced in the first quarter of 2011. inotera: under a supply agreement with inotera, we have the right and obligation to obtain 50% of inotera's output, estimated to be approximately 65,000 300mm dram wafer starts per month by the end of calendar 2010. in 2010, inotera substantially completed a transition of its manufacturing from trench dram process technology to our stack dram process technology. tech: our tech joint venture in singapore manufactures dram products using our product and process technology. subject to specific terms and conditions, we have agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech. in 2010, tech accounted for approximately 24% of our total wafer production and 45% of our total dram production. mp mask: we produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask. we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask. aptina supply agreement: we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina under a wafer supply agreement. (see partnering arrangements ) availability of raw materials our production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards, including several that are customized for, or are unique to, us. we generally have multiple sources and sufficient availability of supply; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames, molding compound and other materials. in addition, transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials. although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not significantly interrupted our operati ons in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the future. also, lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is interrupted, or lead times are extended, our results of operations could be adversely affected. marketing and customers our products are sold into computing, consumer, networking, telecommunications, and imaging markets. approximately 45% of our net sales for 2010 were to the computing market, which includes desktop pcs, servers, notebooks and workstations. sales to hewlett-packard company, primarily of dram, were 13% of our net sales in 2010. sales to intel, primarily of nand flash from our im flash joint ventures, were 9% of our net sales in 2010, 20% of our net sales in 2009 and 19% of our net sales in 2008. our memory products are offered under the micron, lexar , crucial and spectek brand names and private labels. our numonyx products are offered under the numonyx brand name. we market our memory and numonyx semiconductor products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell lexar-branded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial -branded products primarily through a web-based customer direct sales channel. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. we offer products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing, server, automotive, networking, commercial/industrial, consumer electronics, mobile, embedded, security and medical applications. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. 7 backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that pro vided under our general terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; hynix semiconductor inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd; sandisk corporation; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. research and development our process technology research and development ( r&amp;d ) efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts are concentrated on our high density ddr3dram and lp-ddr2 mobile lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory (including multi-level cell technology), nor flash memory, specialty memory, pcm and memory systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $624 million, $647 million and $680 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. we generally share r&amp;d process and design costs for nand flash equally with intel and for dram equally with nanya. as a result of reimbursements under our nand flash and dram cost sharing arrangements with our joint venture partners, our overall r&amp;d expenses were reduced by $155 million, $107 million and $148 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. our process development center and largest design center are located at our corporate headquarters in boise, idaho. we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world. in addition, we develop leading edge photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. 8 geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.1 billion for 2010 and included $3.3 billion in sales to china, $817 million in sales to malaysia, $777 million in sales to europe, $711 million in sales to taiwan, and $1.1 billion in sales to the rest of the asia pacific region (excluding china, malaysia and taiwan). sales to customers outside the united states totaled $3.9 billion for 2009 and $4.4 billion for 2008. as of september 2, 2010, we had net property, plant and equipment of $3.9 billion in the united states, $2.2 billion in singapore, $173 million in italy, $111 million in israel, $90 million in china, $81 million in japan, and $60 million in other countries. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information note and item 1a. risk factors. ) patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of september 2, 2010, we owned approximately 16,800 u.s. patents and 2,900 foreign patents. in addition, we have numerous u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have terms expiring through 2029. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. in recent years, we have recovered some of our investment in technology through sales or license of intellectual property rights to joint venture partners and other third parties. we are pursuing additional opportunities to recover our investment in intellectual property through additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and potential partnering arrangements. on october 1, 2010, we entered into a 10-year patent cross-license agreement with samsung electronics co., ltd. ( samsung ). under the agreement, samsung will pay us $275 million, with $200 million paid in october 2010, $40 million due january 31, 2011 and $35 million due march 31, 2011. the license is a life-of-patents license for existing patents and applications, and a 10-year term license for all other patents. employees as of september 2, 2010, we had approximately 25,900 employees, of which approximately 15,900 were outside the united states, including approximately 6,400 in singapore, 3,400 in italy, 1,500 in japan, 1,300 in china and 1,200 in israel. our employees include approximately 2,300 in our im flash joint ventures, primarily located in the united states, and approximately 1,800 are employees of our tech joint venture, located in singapore. our employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of our production, research and product and process development. many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees. the loss of our key personnel could hav e a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. in 2010, our wholly-owned wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001certification. to continue certification, we met annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal. 9 as of september 2, 2010, the following executive officers and directors were subject

events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. for 2010 average selling prices of nand products decreased 18% and average selling prices of dram products increased 28%. the increase in average selling prices for dram products is the first increase since 2004. for 2009, average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 52% and 56%, respectively, as compared to 2008. for 2008, average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 51% and 67%, respectively, as compared to 2007. for 2007, average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 23% and 56%, respectively, as compared to 2006. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs. if average selling prices for our memory p roducts decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, and changes in process technologies or products that inherently may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products. the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; hynix semiconductor inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. the transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semicon ductor memory. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. as a result of improving conditions in the semiconductor memory market in recent periods, our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 12 the inability to reach an acceptable agreement with our tech joint venture partners regarding the future of tech after its shareholders' agreement expires in april 2011 could have a significant adverse effect on our dram production and results of operation. since 1998, we have participated in tech, a semiconductor memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore among us, canon inc. ( canon ) and hewlett-packard company ( hp ). as of september 2, 2010, the ownership of tech was held approximately 87% by us, approximately 10% by canon and approximately 3% by hp. the financial results of tech are included in our consolidated financial statements. in the fourth quarter of 2010, tech accounted for 48% of our total dram wafer production. the shareholders' agreement for tech expires in april 2011. in the first quarter of 2010, tech received a notice from hp that it does not intend to extend the tech joint venture beyond april 2011. we have been in discussi ons with hp and canon to reach a resolution of the matter. however, there remain wide gaps between our position and those of hp and canon. the parties' inability to reach a resolution of this matter prior to april 2011 would, per the terms of the shareholders' agreement, result in the sale of tech's assets. as of september 2, 2010, the carrying value of tech's net assets was $1.1 billion and in the event of dissolution our loss could be a significant portion of this amount. in addition, the parties' inability to reach a resolution prior to april 2011 could result in the sale of tech's assets and could require repayment of tech's credit facility ($348 million outstanding as of september 2, 2010). the sale of tech's assets per the terms of the shareholders' agreement may have a significant adverse impact on our dram production and results of operation. integration of our acquired numonyx business may disrupt operations and result in significant costs. the integration of our acquired numonyx business is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, even with proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt the business of numonyx and our other operations. realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the timely integration of technology, operations, and personnel. if we are unable to successfully integrate numonyx with our operations in a timely manner our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. the challenges involved in this integration include the following: combining product and service offerings; coordinating research and development activities to enhance the development and introduction of new products and services; preserving customer, supplier and other important relationships of both micron and numonyx and resolving potential conflicts that may arise; managing supply chains and product channels effectively during the period of combining operations; minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns; additional expenses associated with the acquisition and integration of numonyx; retaining key employees; managing new business structures; and coordinating and combining overseas operations, relationships and facilities, which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by geographic distance and local laws and regulations. 13 the downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. the downturn in the worldwide economy had an adverse effect on our business. a continuation or deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers and other computing and networking products, mobile devices, flash memory cards and usb devices. reduced demand for our products could result in continued market oversupply and significant decreases in our average selling prices. a continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experie nce losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. we expect that capital spending will be approximately $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion for 2011. the actual amount in 2011 will vary depending on funding participation by joint venture partners and market conditions. as of september 2, 2010, we had cash and equivalents of $2,913 million, of which $601 millio n consisted of cash and investments of im flash and tech that would generally not be available to finance our other operations. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions, and the adverse conditions in the credit markets, it may be difficult to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or find other sources of financing to fund our operations; make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency; or access capital markets. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks. we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these arrangements include our im flash nand flash joint ventures with intel, our inotera dram joint venture with nanya, our tech dram joint venture, our mp mask joint venture with photronics, our transform joint venture with origin energy and our cmos image sensor wafer supply agreement with aptina . these joint ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners in the future or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in our joint venture; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; recognition of our share of potential inotera, aptina and transform losses in our results of operation; due to financial constraints, our partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in capital contributions to our joint ventures which may result in us increasing our capital contributions to such ventures resulting in additional cash expenditures by us; for example, our contributions to im flash singapore in 2010 and the first two months of 2011 totaled $128 million and $392 million, respectively, while intel's contributions totaled $38 million and $0, respectively; 14 the terms of our arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements; these operations may be less cost-efficient as a result of underutilized capacity; changes in tax, legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners; and political or economic instability may occur in the countries where our joint ventures and/or partners are located. if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. our ownership interest in inotera involves numerous risks. our 29.9% ownership interest in inotera involves numerous risks including the following: risks relating to actions that may be taken or initiated by qimonda ag's ( qimonda ) bankruptcy administrator relating to qimonda's transfer to us of its inotera shares; we may experience continued difficulties in transferring technology to inotera; we may experience continued difficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera; inotera's ability to meet its ongoing obligations; costs associated with manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from underutilized capacity; difficulties in converting inotera production from qimonda's trench technology to our stack technology; uncertainties around the timing and amount of wafer supply we will receive under the supply agreement; and obligations during the technology transition period to procure product based on a competitor's technology which may be difficult to sell and to provide support for such product, with respect to which we have limited technological understanding. in connection with our ownership equity interest in inotera, we have rights and obligations to purchase 50% of the wafer production of inotera. in 2010, we purchased $693 million of dram products from inotera. an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on may 5, 2004, rambus, inc. ( rambus ) filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california (san francisco county) against us and other dram suppliers alleging that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram ( rdram ) by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips. rambus' complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including, among other things, a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices, a conspiracy to monopolize, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and unfair competition. rambus alleges that it is entitled to actual damages of more than a billion dollars and seeks joint and several liability, treble damages, punitive damages, a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint, interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. a trial date has not been scheduled. (see item 1. legal proceedings for additional details on this case and other rambus matters pending in the u.s. and europe.) on september 24, 2010, oracle america inc. ( oracle ), successor to sun microsystems, a dram purchaser that opted-out of a direct purchaser class action suit that was settled, filed suit against us in u.s. district court for the northern district of california. the complaint alleges dram price-fixing and other violations of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws based on purported conduct for the period from august 1, 1998 through at least june 15, 2002. oracle is seeking joint and several damages, trebled, as well as restitution, disgorgement, attorneys' fees, costs and injunctive relief. 15 we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. an adverse court determination in any of these lawsuits alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on january 13, 2006, rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2, ddr3, rldram, and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages, treble damages, and injunctive relief. the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales. on june 2, 2006, we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging, among other things, antitrust and fraud claims. on january 9, 2009, in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware, judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambu had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us. rambus subsequently appealed the delaware court's decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. that appeal is pending. subsequently, the northern district of california court stayed a trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case pending the outcome of the appeal of the delaware court's spoliation decision or further order of the california court. (see item 1. legal proceedings for additional details on this lawsuit and other rambus matters pending in the u.s. and europe.) on march 6, 2009, panavision imaging llc filed suit against us and aptina imaging corporation, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, in the u.s. district court for the central district of california. the complaint alleges that certain of our and aptina's image sensor products infringe four panavision imaging u.s. patents and seeks injunctive relief, damages, attorneys' fees, and costs. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. if, despite design review, quality control and product qualification procedures, problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products, we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product, and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. 16 there are a number of risks and uncertainties related to numonyx's former joint venture with hynix. in connection with our purchase of numonyx on may 7, 2010, we acquired a 20.7% noncontrolling equity interest in hynix-numonyx semiconductor ltd. (the hynix jv ), a joint venture with hynix semiconductor, inc. ( hynix ) and hynix semiconductor (wuxi) limited. the change in control of numonyx gave hynix the right to purchase all of our equity interests in the hynix jv. hynix exercised its right to purchase our interest in the hynix jv and consummated the equity transfer on august 31, 2010 for $423 million. a significant portion of numonyx's sales are dependent upon sales of products supplied to us by the hynix jv pursuant to a supply agreement. on july 29, 2010, we entered into a new supply agreement with hynix, which provides for the continued supply of products through september 30, 2011 at market rates. pricing under the new agreement is not anticipated to be as favorable as pricing under the jv supply agreement that existed prior to the sale of our ownership interest in the hynix jv. concurrent with the numonyx acquisition, we entered into agreements with stmicroelectronics n.v. and dbs bank ltd. ( dbs ) that require us to guarantee an outstanding $250 million loan, due in periodic installments from 2014 through 2016, made by dbs to the hynix jv. under the agreements, on august 31, 2010, we deposited $250 million of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the hynix jv into a pledged account at dbs to collateralize our obligations under the guarantee of the loan. the amount on deposit in the dbs account is accounted for as restricted cash on our balance sheet. the amount on deposit and our guarantee decrease as payments are made by the hynix jv against the loan.&#1 60; there can be no assurance that the hynix jv will not default under such loan. we may make future acquisitions and alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following: difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increasing debt to finance an acquisition or formation of a new business; diverting management's attention from normal daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; and hiring and retaining key employees. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future transactions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products, that we will be able t o successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. our debt level is higher than compared to historical periods. we currently have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods. as of september 2, 2010 we had $2.4 billion of debt, net of discounts of $247 million. we may need to incur additional debt in the future. our debt level could adversely impact us. for example it could: 17 make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other general corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions; expose us to fluctuations in interest rates with respect to that portion of our debt which is at a variable rate of interest; and require us to make additional investments in joint ventures to maintain compliance with financial covenants. several of our credit facilities, one of which was modified during 2009 and another of which was modified in 2010, have covenants that require us to maintain minimum levels of tangible net worth and cash and investments. as of september 2, 2010, we were in compliance with our debt covenants. if we are unable to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants, or obtain waivers, an event of default could be triggered, which, if not cured, could cause the maturity of other borrowings to be accelerated and become due and currently payable. covenants in our debt instruments may obligate us to repay debt, increase contributions to our tech joint venture and limit our ability to obtain financing. our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt may be affected by economic or business conditions or other events. as of september 2, 2010, our 87% owned tech semiconductor singapore pte. ltd., ( tech ) subsidiary, had $348 million outstanding under a credit facility with covenants that, among other requirements, establish certain liquidity, debt service coverage and leverage ratios for tech and restrict tech's ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and acquire or dispose of assets. if tech does not comply with these debt covenants and restrictions, this debt may be deemed to be in default and the debt declared payable. there can be no assurance that tech will be able to comply with its covenants.&#1 60; additionally, if tech is unable to repay its borrowings when due, the lenders under tech's credit facility could proceed against substantially all of tech's assets. in the first quarter of 2010, tech amended certain of its debt covenants under the credit facility. we have guaranteed 100% of the outstanding amount borrowed under tech's credit facility. if tech's debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due. existing covenant restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. to avoid covenant defaults we may be required to repay debt obligations or make additional contributions to tech, all of which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and are reported in u.s. dollars. across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies, primarily the singapore dollar, euro and yen. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $23 million for 2010, $30 million for 2009 and of $25 million for 2008. we estimate that, based on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar as of september 2, 2010, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar would expose us to foreign currency gains or losses of approximately u.s. $2 million for the singapore dollar and u.s. $1 million for the euro and the yen . in the event that the u.s. dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar, euro and yen, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. 18 the limited availability certain raw materials or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including equipment scanners, we are dependent on a single supplier. in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconduc tor equipment timely, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we may incur additional material restructure charges in future periods. in response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions, we implemented restructure initiatives that resulted in net charges of $70 million in 2009 and $33 million in 2008. the restructure initiatives included shutting down our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in boise, suspending the production ramp of a new fabrication facility in singapore and other personnel cost reductions. we may need to implement further restructure initiatives in future periods. as a result of these initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, lose production output, lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in delivering products timely. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 83% of our consolidated net sales for 2010. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: currency exchange rate fluctuations; export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 19 our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited. we have a valuation allowance against substantially all u.s. net deferred tax assets. as of september 2, 2010, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $2.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $290 million, respectively. if not utilized, substantially all of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2022 to 2029 and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015. as of september 2, 2010, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were $188 million and $204 million respectively. if not utilized, substantially all of our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2013 to 2030. as a consequence of prior business acquisitions, utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income. the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions. if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. additionally, our control over operations at our im flash, tech, inotera, mp mask and transform joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturi ng yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete. in recent years, manufacturing supply has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram, nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors. the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants. some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments have provided, or are considering, significant financial assistance for some of our competitors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of september 2, 2010, $1,810 million of our $2,360 million of debt was at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. the estimated fair value of our debt was $2,565 million as of september 2, 2010 and $2,868 million as of september 3, 2009. we estimate that, as of september 2, 2010, a 1% decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed-rate debt instruments by approximately $49 million. as of september 2, 2010, $550 million of the debt had variable interest rates and a 1% increase in the rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item 1a. risk factors. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. we held cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at an aggregate of u.s. $504 million as of september 2, 2010 and u.s. $229 million as of september 3, 2009. we also had foreign currency liabilities valued at an aggregate of u.s. $901 million as of september 2, 2010, and u.s. $742 million as of september 3, 2009. significant components of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were as follows (in u.s. dollar equivalents): september 2, 2010 september 3, 2009 singapore dollars yen euro singapore dollars yen euro (amounts in millions) deferred tax assets $ -- $ 115 $ 6 $ -- $ 115 $ 4 other assets 88 55 196 25 17 40 accounts payable and accrued expenses (158 ) (186 ) (168 ) (68 ) (141 ) (99 ) debt (78 ) (9 ) (61 ) (289 ) (25 ) (4 ) other liabilities (14 ) (75 ) (100 ) (8 ) (55 ) (41 ) net assets (liabilities) $ (162 ) $ (100 ) $ (127 ) $ (340 ) $ (89 ) $ (100 ) we estimate that, based on the assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar as of september 2, 2010, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar would expose us to foreign currency gains or losses of approximately u.s. $2 million for the singapore dollar and u.s. $1 million for the euro and the yen. during the first quarter of 2010, we began using derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk.

nand flash and nor flash memory, as well as other innovative memory technologies, packaging solutions and semiconductor systems for use in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking, automotive, industrial and mobile products. in addition, we manufacture semiconductor components for cmos image sensors and other semiconductor products. we market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world. our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and the return on research and development investments. we obtain products from three primary sources: (1) production from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities, (2) production from our joint venture manufacturing facilities and (3) to a lesser degree from third party manufacturers. in recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements, including joint ventures, which have helped us to attain lower costs than we could otherwise achieve through internal investments alone. 2 we have made significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technology that is implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and through our joint ventures to enable the production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs. we generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as our leading-edge line-width process technology and innovative array architecture. we continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption and increased memory density. to leverage our significant investments in research and development, we have formed various strategic joint ventures that have allowed us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with our joint venture partners. in addition, from time to time, we have also sold and/or licensed technology to other parties. we continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. in the second quarter of 2011, we reorganized our business to better align with the markets we serve. all prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this reorganization. after the reorganization, we have the following four reportable segments: dram solutions group ("dsg"): includes high-volume dram products sold to the pc, consumer electronics, networking and server markets. nand solutions group ("nsg"): includes high-volume nand flash products sold into data storage, personal music players, and portions of computing markets, as well as nand flash products sold to intel corporation ("intel") through our consolidated im flash joint ventures. wireless solutions group ("wsg"): includes dram, nand flash and nor flash products, including multi-chip packages, sold to the mobile device market. embedded solutions group ("esg"): includes dram, nand flash and nor flash products sold into automotive and industrial applications, as well as nor and nand flash sold to consumer electronics, networking, pc and server markets. our other operations do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other. all other includes our cmos image sensor, led, microdisplay and solar operations. products over the past several years we have been focused on diversifying our product portfolio beyond dram products, which historically had constituted a substantial majority of our sales. in 2011, sales of dram products were less than half our total sales and in the fourth quarter of 2011 sales of nand flash products exceeded sales of dram products for the first time in our history. dynamic random access memory ("dram") dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval. dram products were 41%, 60% and 50% of our total net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. dram products are sold by the dsg, wsg and esg segments. we offer dram products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics including high-volume ddr3 and ddr2 products as well as specialty dram memory products including mobile low power dram ("lpdram"), ddr, sdram, reduced latency dram ("rldram") and pseudo-static dram ("psram"). ddr3 and ddr2 : ddr3 and ddr2 are standardized, high-density, high-volume dram products that are sold primarily for use as main system memory in computers and servers. ddr3 and ddr2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost compared to other dram products. ddr3 products were 21%, 22% and 7% of our total net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. ddr2 products were 10%, 24% and 22% of our total net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. we offer ddr3 products in 1 gigabit ("gb"), 2gb and 4 gb densities and ddr2 products in 256 megabit ("mb"), 512 mb, 1 gigabit and 2 gb densities. we expect these densities will be necessary to meet future customer demands for a broad array of products and offer these products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types. 3 specialty dram products : we also offer dram memory products including ddr and ddr2 mobile lpdram, ddr, sdram, rldram and psram in densities ranging from 64 mb to 2 gb. lpdram products are used primarily in laptop computers, tablets, and other consumer devices that require low power consumption. our other specialty dram products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment and computer peripherals as well as computer memory upgrades. aggregate sales of lpdram and our other dram products were 10%, 14% and 21% of our total net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. nand flash memory ("nand") nand products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand sales were 36%, 28% and 39% of our total net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. nand products are sold by the nsg, wsg and esg segments. nand is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memory. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash memory cards, are used with applications such as personal computers, digital still cameras, mp3/4 players and mobile phones. embedded nand-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, mp3/4 players, computers, solid-state drives ("ssds"), tablets and other personal and consumer applications. the market for nand products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to demand for these and other removable and embedded storage devices. our nand products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we offer single-level cell ("slc") nand products and multi-level cell ("mlc") nand products, which have two or more times the bit density of slc nand products. in 2011, we offered slc nand products in 1 gb, 2 gb, 4 gb and 8 gb densities. in addition, we offered 8 gb, 16 gb, 32 gb and 64 gb 2-bit-per-cell mlc nand products and 32 gb and 64 gb 3-bit-per-cell mlc nand products. we offer high-speed nand products that are compatible with advanced interfaces. we offer nand flash in multichip packages ("mcps") that incorporate nand flash with other memory products to create a single package that simplifies design while improving performance and functionality. we offer next-generation realssd solid-state drives for enterprise server and notebook applications which feature higher performance, reduced power consumption and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. using our slc and mlc nand process technology, these ssds are offered in 2.5-inch and 1.8-inch form factors, with densities up to 512 gigabytes. we also offer embedded usb devices with densities up to 16 gigabytes. we are sampling enterprise pcie ssds with capacities up to 700 gigabytes. we expect that demand for ssds will continue to increase significantly over the next several years. through our lexar brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and original equipment manufacturing ("oem") channels. our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and jumpdrive products with a range of speeds, capacities and value-added features. we offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including: compactflash, memory stick and secure digital ("sd"). compactflash and memory stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. other products, including sd memory cards and some jumpdrive products, incorporate third party controllers. we sell products under our lexar brand and manufacture products that are sold under other brand names. we also resell flash memory products that are purchased from other nand flash suppliers. nor flash memory ("nor") nor products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off, offer fast read times due to random access capability and have execute-in-place ("xip") capability that enables processors to read nor without first accessing ram. these capabilities make nor ideal for storing program code in wireless and embedded applications. our nor sales originated from the may 7, 2010 acquisition of numonyx and were 18% and 5% of our total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. nor products are sold by the wsg and esg segments. we offer both parallel and serial interface nor products in a broad range of densities, packages, and features. our parallel nor products are constructed to meet the needs of the consumer electronics, industrial, wired and wireless communications, computing and automotive applications. these products offer high densities, xip performance, architectural flexibility and proven reliability in rigorous industrial settings. our serial nor products are designed to meet the needs of consumer electronics, industrial, wired communications, and computing applications. these products offer industry-standard packaging, pinouts, command sets and chipset compatibility. 4 phase change memory ("pcm") pcm is a new memory technology that combines the attributes of nor, nand and ram, simplifying memory and producing more capabilities within a single chip. pcm is bit-alterable, non-volatile memory featuring fast read/write/erase speeds that is highly scalable to lower line-width technologies. we currently offer both parallel and serial interface pcm products and expect that the market for these products will increase significantly in the next several years. partnering arrangements the following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of september 1, 2011: partner(s) approximate micron ownership interest formed/ acquired product market consolidated entities: imft (1) intel corporation 51 % 2006 nand flash imfs (1) intel corporation 86 % 2007 nand flash mp mask (2) photronics, inc. 50 % 2006 photomasks equity method investments: inotera (3) nanya technology corporation 30 % 2009 dram meiya (3) nanya technology corporation 50 % 2008 dram transform (4) origin energy limited 50 % 2010 solar panels aptina (5) riverwood capital llc and tpg partners vi, l.p. 35 % 2009 cmos image sensors (1) im flash: we partner with intel corporation ("intel") for the design, development and manufacture of nand flash products. in connection therewith, we have formed two joint ventures with intel to manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners: im flash technologies, llc ("imft") and im flash singapore llp ("imfs") (collectively, "im flash"). as of september 1, 2011, we owned an approximate 51% interest in imft and an approximate 86% interest in imfs with the remaining interests held by intel. our ownership interest in imfs increased from 51% prior to the second quarter of 2010 to 86% on september 1, 2011 as intel did not match our capital contributions. on september 26, 2011, intel participated in a capital call of imfs by contributing $131 million. after that capital call, our ownership interest in imfs was reduced to 82%. the partners share the output of im flash generally in proportion to their investment in im flash. we sell nand flash products to intel through im flash at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. we generally share product design and other research and development costs equally with intel. in 2011, im flash began ramping production at a new singapore wafer fabrication facility and we expect that output from this facility will significantly increase our overall nand flash production in 2012. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated variable interest entities nand flash joint ventures with intel" note.) (2) mp mask: we produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask technology center, llc ("mp mask"), a joint venture with photronics, inc. ("photronics"). we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated variable interest entities mp mask technology center, llc." note.) 5 (3) inotera and meiya: we partner with nanya technology corporation ("nanya") for the design, development and manufacture of stack dram products, including the joint development of dram process technology. in connection therewith, we have partnered with nanya in two taiwan dram memory companies, inotera memories, inc. ("inotera") and meiya technology corporation ("meiya"). we have a supply agreement with inotera and nanya which gives us the right and obligation to purchase 50% of inotera's semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions. under the formula for this supply agreement, all parties' manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera, as well as our and nanya's revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera, are considered in determining costs for wafers from inotera. inotera accounted for 37% of our dram gigabit production in the fourth quarter of 2011. we also partner with nanya to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products. in connection with the partnering agreement, we have also deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of stack dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya. under a cost-sharing arrangement effective beginning in april 2010, we generally share dram development costs equally with nanya. in addition, in 2010 we began receiving royalties from nanya for sales of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya with technology developed prior to april 2010. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments inotera and meiya dram joint ventures with nanya" note.) (4) transform: on december 18, 2009, we acquired a 50% interest in transform solar pty limited ("transform"), a subsidiary of origin energy limited ("origin") in exchange for nonmonetary assets with a fair value of $65 million, consisting of manufacturing facilities, equipment, intellectual property and a fully-paid lease to a portion of our boise, idaho manufacturing facilities. transform develops and manufactures photovoltaic solar panels. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments transform" note.) (5) aptina: we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina under a wafer supply agreement. we own 64% of aptina's common stock and none of their preferred stock resulting in a total ownership interest in aptina of 35%. our investment in aptina is accounted for as an equity method investment, in which we recognize our share of aptina's results of operations based on our 64% share of aptina's common stock. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments aptina" note.) manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, israel, italy, malaysia, puerto rico and singapore. our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan. in 2011, we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan to tower semiconductor ltd. ("tower") and entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may 2014. our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment. dram, nand and nor share common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. we continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products. in 2011, we transitioned the majority of our dram production to 42nm line-width process technology and began transitioning to 30nm line-width process technology. in 2011 most of our nand flash memory products were manufactured on our 25nm line-width process technology and we expect to continue transitioning to 20nm line-width process technology in 2012. in 2011, we manufactured all of our nand flash and our high-volume dram products on 300mm wafers. we manufactured nor flash, some specialty dram and cmos image sensor products on 200mm wafers. in 2011, the majority of our nor flash memory products were manufactured on our 65nm line-width process technology and we expect to continue transitioning to 45nm line-width technology in 2012. 6 wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. we are able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. after fabrication, most silicon wafers are separated into individual die. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms. for packaged products, functional die are sorted, connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages. we assemble products in a variety of packages, including tsop (thin small outline package), tqfp (thin quad flat package) and fbga (fine pitch ball grid array). bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility for use in packaging technologies such as systems-in-a-package (sips) and multi-chip packages (mcps), which reduce the board area required. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. we assemble a significant portion of our memory products into memory modules. memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards ("pcbs") that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices. we also contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture lexar-brand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices. we utilize subcontractors to perform a significant portion of our assembly and module assembly services. outsourcing these services enables us to reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing process. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. nand flash joint ventures with intel corporation our im flash joint ventures with intel manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners. we share the output of im flash with intel generally in proportion to our and intel's investment in im flash. in 2011, im flash began ramping production at a new singapore wafer fabrication facility and we expect that output from this facility will significantly increase our overall nand flash production in 2012. inotera under a supply agreement with inotera, we have the right and obligation to obtain 50% of inotera's total capacity of approximately 130,000 300mm dram wafer starts per month as of september 1, 2011. inotera accounted for 33% of our dram gigabit production in 2011. mp mask we produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask. we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we have agreed to purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask. aptina supply agreement we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina under a wafer supply agreement. (see "partnering arrangements") 7 availability of raw materials our production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards, including several that are customized for, or are unique to, us. we generally have multiple sources and sufficient availability of supply. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, molding compound and other materials. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is interrupted or our lead times extended, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. marketing and customers our products are sold into computing, consumer, networking, telecommunications, automotive, industrial and imaging markets. market concentrations from 2011 net sales were approximately as follows: computing (including desktop pcs, servers, notebooks and workstations), 30% ; mobile, 25% ; consumer electronics, 15% ; and networking and storage, 15% . sales to intel, primarily of nand flash from our im flash joint ventures, were 10% of our net sales in 2011, 9% of our net sales in 2010, and 20% of our net sales in 2009. sales to hewlett-packard company, primarily of dram, were 9% of our net sales in 2011 and 13% of our net sales in 2010. our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron, lexar , crucial , spectek and numonyx brand names and private labels. we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell lexar-branded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial -branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. we offer products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing, server, automotive, networking, commercial/industrial, consumer electronics, mobile, embedded, security and medical applications. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions. 8 competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; hynix semiconductor inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd; sandisk corporation; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications, and as such, have similar performance characteristics to our competitors. for these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size and form factors. for our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedent to pricing. research and development our process technology research and development ("r&amp;d") efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts are concentrated on our high density ddr3 dram and lp-ddr2 mobile lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory (including multi-level cell technology), nor flash memory, specialty memory, pcm and other next-generation memories and memory systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $791 million, $624 million and $647 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. we generally share r&amp;d process and design costs for nand flash equally with intel and for dram equally with nanya. as a result of reimbursements under our nand flash and dram cost sharing arrangements with our joint venture partners, our overall r&amp;d expenses were reduced by $236 million, $155 million and $107 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. our process development center and largest design center are located at our corporate headquarters in boise, idaho. in 2011, we began construction of a new 450mm-wafer capable r&amp;d facility in boise which we expect will be ready for tool installations in the beginning of calendar year 2012. we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world. in addition, we develop leading edge photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.4 billion for 2011 and included $3.0 billion in sales to china, $924 million in sales to europe, $744 million in sales to taiwan, $737 million in sales to malaysia and $1.5 billion in sales to the rest of the asia pacific region (excluding china, malaysia and taiwan). sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.1 billion for 2010 and $3.9 billion for 2009. as of september 1, 2011, we had net property, plant and equipment of $3.6 billion in singapore, $3.5 billion in the united states, $190 million in italy, $179 million in china, $94 million in israel, and $36 million in other countries. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information" note and "item 1a. risk factors.") 9 patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of september 1, 2011, we owned approximately 17,100 u.s. patents and 3,200 foreign patents. in addition, we have numerous u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2030. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. in recent years, we have recovered some of our investment in technology through sales or licenses of intellectual property rights to joint venture partners and other third parties. we are pursuing additional opportunities to recover our investment in intellectual property through additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and potential partnering arrangements. employees as of september 1, 2011, we had approximately 26,100 employees, of which approximately 15,500 were outside the united states, including approximately 7,600 in singapore, 3,300 in italy, 1,700 in china, 1,300 in israel and 1,000 in malaysia. our employees include approximately 2,800 in our im flash joint ventures, primarily located in the united states and singapore. our employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of our production, research and product and process development. many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees. the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. in 2011, our wholly-owned wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001certification. to continue certification, we met annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. while we have not experienced any materially adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal. 10 as of september 1, 2011,

this form 10-k, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices in recent years as noted in the table below. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs. dram nand flash (percentage change in average selling prices) 2011 from 2010 (39 )% (17 )% 2010 from 2009 28 % * (18 )% 2009 from 2008 (52 )% (56 )% 2008 from 2007 (51 )% (67 )% 2007 from 2006 (23 )% (56 )% * only increase in dram pricing since 2004. we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products. an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on may 5, 2004, rambus, inc. ("rambus") filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california (san francisco county) against us and other dram suppliers alleging that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram ("rdram") by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips. rambus' complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including, among other things, a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices, a conspiracy to monopolize, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and unfair competition. rambus is seeking a judgment for damages of approximately $3.9 billion, joint and several liability, trebling of damages awarded, punitive damages, a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint, interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. trial began on june 20, 2011, and the case went to the jury on september 21, 2011. at the time of this filing, a jury verdict is pending. we cannot predict when a verdict will be reached or when a formal judgment would be entered by the court subsequent to a verdict. in the event of an adverse judgment, we would anticipate filing appropriate post-judgment motions and appeals. we may be required to post a bond or other security to stay enforcement of an adverse judgment pending appeal. depending on the amount required, we cannot assure you we would be able to obtain sufficient security to pursue an appeal. we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss. accordingly, we have not provided an accrual for an adverse judgment in the september 1, 2011, financial statements. however, we have accrued a liability and charged operations for estimated costs to successfully defend the matter. an adverse judgment may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity. 14 on september 24, 2010, oracle america inc. ("oracle"), successor to sun microsystems, a dram purchaser that opted-out of a direct purchaser class action suit that was settled, filed suit against us in u.s. district court for the northern district of california. the complaint alleges dram price-fixing and other violations of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws based on purported conduct for the period from august 1, 1998 through at least june 15, 2002. oracle is seeking joint and several damages, trebled, as well as restitution, disgorgement, attorneys' fees, costs and injunctive relief. we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. an adverse court determination in any of these lawsuits alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; hynix semiconductor inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. the transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. the downturn in the worldwide economy had an adverse effect on our business. a continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers and other computing and networking products, mobile devices, flash memory cards and usb devices. reduced demand for our products could result in continued market oversupply and significant decreases in our average selling prices. a continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. inotera's liquidity risk may adversely impact our ownership interest and supply agreement. because of significant market declines in the selling price of dram, inotera incurred net losses of $278 million for the six-month period ended june 30, 2011. also, inotera's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $2.3 billion as of june 30, 2011, which exposes inotera to liquidity risk. further, under generally accepted accounting principles in the republic of china, inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended september 30, 2011 of an additional new taiwan dollars 7,022 million (approximately $241 million u.s. dollars). inotera's management has developed plans to improve its liquidity. if inotera is unable to adequately improve its liquidity, we may have to impair our $323 million investment in inotera. in connection with our ownership equity interest in inotera, we have rights and obligations to purchase 50% of the wafer production capacity of inotera. in 2011, we purchased $ 641 million of dram products from inotera, and our supply from inotera accounted for 37% or our dram gigabit production in the fourth quarter of 2011. as a result, if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our supply agreement with inotera involves numerous risks. our supply agreement with inotera involves numerous risks including the following: we have experienced difficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera on our technology and may continue to experience difficulties and delays in the future; we may experience continued difficulties in transferring technology to inotera; costs associated with manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from underutilized capacity; 15 difficulties in obtaining high yield and throughput due to differences in inotera's manufacturing processes from our other fabrication facilities; uncertainties around the timing and amount of wafer supply we will receive under the supply agreement; and the cost of our product obtained from inotera is impacted by nanya's revenue and back-end manufacturing costs for product obtained from inotera. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda ag ("qimonda") insolvency proceedings, filed suit against us and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary, in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between us and qimonda in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the inotera shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. a hearing is scheduled to begin on november 9, 2011. we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies. our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram, nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements, and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies . there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, research and development, and product and process technology. we estimate that capital spending for 2012 will be approximately $2 billion. the actual amounts for 2012 will vary depending on funding participation by joint venture partners and market conditions. as of september 1, 2011 , we had cash and equivalents of $2,160 million , of which $ 327 million consisted of cash and investments of im flash that is generally not available to finance our other operations. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed . as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions and the adverse conditions in the credit markets , it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency, or access capital markets. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 16 our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks. we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these arrangements include our im flash nand flash joint ventures with intel, our inotera dram joint venture with nanya, our mp mask joint venture with photronics, our transform joint venture with origin energy and our cmos image sensor wafer supply agreement with aptina . these joint ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in our joint venture; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; we may need to recognize our share of losses from inotera, aptina or transform in our future results of operations; due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in capital contributions to our joint ventures, which may result in us increasing our capital contributions to such ventures, resulting in additional cash expenditures by us; for example, our contributions to im flash singapore in 2011 and 2010 totaled $ 1,580 million and $128 million, respectively, while intel's contributions totaled $ 0 and $38 million, respectively; the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements; and changes in tax, legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on january 13, 2006, rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2, ddr3, rldram, and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages, treble damages, and injunctive relief. the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales. on june 2, 2006, we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging, among other things, antitrust and fraud claims. on january 9, 2009, in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware, judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us. rambus subsequently appealed the delaware court's decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. on may 13, 2011, the federal circuit affirmed judge robinson's finding of spoliation, but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the delaware district court for analysis of the remedy based on the federal circuit's decision. the northern district of california court stayed a trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the federal circuit. (see "item 1. legal proceedings" for additional details on this lawsuit and other rambus matters pending in the u.s. and europe.) we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. 17 products that fail to meet specifications, are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. if problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products, we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product, and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. we may make future acquisitions and alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following: integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increasing debt to finance an acquisition or formation of a new business; diverting management's attention from normal daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; and hiring and retaining key employees. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future transactions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the limited availability of raw materials, supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor equipment timely, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 18 new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. we cannot assure you that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited. we have a valuation allowance against substantially all u.s. net deferred tax assets. as of september 1, 2011, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $2.9 billion, $2.0 billion and $529 million, respectively. if not utilized, substantially all of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2022 to 2031 and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015. as of september 1, 2011, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were $206 million and $215 million respectively. if not utilized, substantially all of our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2013 to 2031. as a consequence of prior business acquisitions, utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income. the determination of these tax limitations is complex and requires a significant amount of judgment by us with respect to analysis of past transactions. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the singapore dollar, euro and yen. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $ 6 million for 2011 and $23 million for 2010. to the extent our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar as of september 1, 2011 are not hedged, we estimate that a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar would expose us to foreign currency gains or losses of approximately u.s. $ 2 million for the euro and u.s. $ 1 million for the yen and singapore dollar. in the event that the u.s. dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar, euro or yen, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84% of our consolidated net sales for 2011. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export control laws and similar rules and regulations; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels; disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 19 if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. additionally, our control over operations at our im flash, inotera, mp mask and transform joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may incur additional material restructure charges in future periods. in response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions, we implemented restructure initiatives that resulted in net charges of $70 million in 2009 and $33 million in 2008. we may need to implement further restructure initiatives in future periods. as a result of these initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, lose production output, lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in delivering products timely. consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete. in recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram, nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors. the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants. some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation. in addition, some governments have provided, or are considering providing, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. quantitative and qualitative disclolsures about market risk interest rate risk as of september 1, 2011 , $ 1,950 million of our $ 2,001 million of debt was at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. the estimated fair value of our debt was $ 2,281 million as of september 1, 2011 and $ 2,565 million as of september 2, 2010 . we estimate that, as of september 1, 2011 , a 1% decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed-rate debt instruments by approximately $ 59 million . as of september 1, 2011 , $ 51 million of the debt had variable interest rates and a 1% increase in the rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $ 1 million . foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in "item 1a. risk factors." changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. we held cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at an aggregate of u.s. $ 512 million as of september 1, 2011 and u.s. $ 504 million as of september 2, 2010 . we also had foreign currency liabilities valued at an aggregate of u.s. $ 944 million as of september 1, 2011 , and u.s. $ 901 million as of september 2, 2010 . because the substantial majority of our sales are denominated in u.s. dollar, we do not have significant natural hedges to offset our expenditures denominated in other currencies. significant components of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency) were as follows (in u.s. dollar equivalents): 2011 2010 singapore dollars yen euro other singapore dollars yen euro other (amounts in millions) cash and cash equivalents $ 22 $ 4 $ 33 $ 21 $ 27 $ 27 $ 53 $ 19 receivables 92 25 72 18 52 15 77 23 deferred tax assets 39 7 1 115 6 1 other assets 12 16 88 62 9 13 66 1 accounts payable and accrued expenses (124 ) (194 ) (240 ) (44 ) (158 ) (186 ) (168 ) (45 ) debt (81 ) (3 ) (3 ) (78 ) (9 ) (61 ) other liabilities (15 ) (8 ) (128 ) (104 ) (14 ) (75 ) (100 ) (7 ) net assets (liabilities) $ (94 ) $ (118 ) $ (171 ) $ (49 ) $ (162 ) $ (100 ) $ (127 ) $ (8 ) we estimate that, based on the assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar as of september 1, 2011 , a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar, resulting in currency gains or losses of approximately u.s. $ 2 million for the euro and $ 1 million for the yen and singapore dollar . during 2010, we began using derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk.

(see "item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview.") business segments we have the following four reportable segments: nand solutions group ("nsg"): includes high-volume nand flash products sold into data storage, personal music players and the high-density computing market, as well as nand flash products sold to intel corporation ("intel") through im flash. dram solutions group ("dsg"): includes dram products sold to the pc, consumer electronics, networking and server markets. wireless solutions group ("wsg"): includes dram, nand flash and nor flash products, including multi-chip packages, sold to the mobile device market. embedded solutions group ("esg"): includes dram, nand flash and nor flash products sold into automotive and industrial applications, as well as nor and nand flash sold to consumer electronics, networking, pc and server markets. our other operations do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other. products nand flash memory nand flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand flash sales were 44%, 36% and 30% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. nand flash products are sold by our nsg, wsg and esg segments. nand flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash memory cards, are used with applications such as pcs, digital still cameras, mp3/4 players and mobile phones. embedded nand flash-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, mp3/4 players, computers, solid-state drives ("ssds"), tablets and other personal and consumer applications. the market for nand flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to demand for these and other removable and embedded storage devices. our nand flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we offer single-level cell ("slc") nand flash products as well as multi-level cell ("mlc") and triple-level cell ("tlc") nand flash products, which have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of slc nand flash products. in 2012, we offered slc nand products in 1 gigabit ("gb") to 64gb densities. in addition, we offered 8gb to 128gb 2-bit-per-cell mlc nand flash products and 32gb to 128gb 3-bit-per-cell tlc nand flash products. we offer high-speed nand flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces. additionally, our multichip packages ("mcps") incorporate nand flash with other memory products to create a single package that simplifies design while improving performance and functionality. 2 we offer next-generation realssd ssds for enterprise server and notebook applications which feature higher performance, reduced power consumption and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. using our slc and mlc nand flash process technology, these ssds are offered in 2.5-inch and 1.8-inch form factors, with densities up to 512 gigabytes ("gb"). we also offer embedded usb devices with densities up to 16gb. we are sampling enterprise pcie ssds with capacities up to 700gb. we expect that demand for ssds will continue to increase significantly over the next several years. through our lexar brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and oem channels. our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and jumpdrive products with a range of speeds, capacities and value-added features. we offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including: compactflash, memory stick and secure digital ("sd"). compactflash and memory stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. other products, including sd memory cards and some jumpdrive products, incorporate third party controllers. we also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other nand flash suppliers. dynamic random access memory ("dram") dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval. dram sales products were 39%, 41% and 60% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. dram products are sold by our dsg, wsg and esg segments. we offer dram products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics including high-volume ddr3 and ddr2 products as well as specialty dram memory products including mobile low power dram ("lpdram"), ddr, sdram, reduced latency dram ("rldram") and pseudo-static dram ("psram"). ddr3 and ddr2 : ddr3 and ddr2 are standardized, high-density, high-volume, dram products that are sold primarily for use as main system memory in computers and servers. ddr3 and ddr2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost. ddr3 sales were 20%, 21% and 22% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. ddr2 sales were 9%, 10% and 24% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. we expect to begin volume production of ddr4 products in 2013. we offer ddr3 products in 1gb, 2gb and 4gb densities and ddr2 products in 512 megabit ("mb"), 1gb and 2gb densities. these densities enable us to meet customer demands for a broad array of products and we offer these products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types. specialty dram products : we also offer dram memory products including ddr and ddr2 mobile lpdram, ddr, sdram, rldram and psram in densities ranging from 64mb to 4gb. lpdram products are used primarily in laptop computers, tablets and other consumer devices that require low power consumption. our other specialty dram products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment and computer peripherals as well as computer memory upgrades. aggregate sales of lpdram and our other specialty dram products were 10%, 10% and 14% of our total net sales in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. nor flash memory nor flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off, offer fast read times due to random access capability and have execute-in-place ("xip") capability that enables processors to read nor flash without first accessing ram. these capabilities make nor ideal for storing program code in wireless and embedded applications. our nor flash sales originated from the may 7, 2010 acquisition of numonyx and were 12%, 18% and 5% of our total net sales for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. nor flash products are sold by our wsg and esg segments. we offer both parallel and serial interface nor flash products in a broad range of densities, packages and features. our parallel nor flash products are constructed to meet the needs of the consumer electronics, industrial, wired and wireless communications, computing and automotive applications. these products offer high densities, xip performance, architectural flexibility and proven reliability in rigorous industrial settings. our serial nor flash products are designed to meet the needs of consumer electronics, industrial, wired communications and computing applications. these products offer industry-standard packaging, pinouts, command sets and chipset compatibility. 3 partnering arrangements the following

(see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated variable interest entities mp mask" note.) (3) inotera: we partner with nanya technology corporation ("nanya") for the design, development and manufacture of dram products, including the joint development of dram process technology. in connection therewith, we have partnered with nanya in a dram memory company in taiwan, inotera memories, inc. ("inotera"). we have a supply agreement with inotera and nanya which gives us the right and obligation to purchase 50% of inotera's semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions. under the formula for this supply agreement, all parties' manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera, as well as our and nanya's revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera, are considered in determining costs for wafers purchased by us from inotera. in connection with the partnering agreement, we have also deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya. we also partner with nanya to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture dram products. under a cost-sharing arrangement effective beginning in april 2010, we generally share dram development costs with nanya. in addition, in 2010 we began receiving royalties from nanya for sales of dram products manufactured by or for nanya with technology developed prior to april 2010. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments inotera" note.) (4) aptina: we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina under a wafer supply agreement. we own 64% of aptina's common stock and none of their preferred stock resulting in a total ownership interest in aptina of 35%. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments other" note.) 4 on august 30, 2012, we had a 50% interest in transform solar pty limited ("transform"), a joint venture with origin energy limited ("origin"). transform developed and manufactured photovoltaic solar panels. as a result of the ongoing challenging global environment in the solar industry and unfavorable worldwide supply and demand conditions, on may 25, 2012, the board of directors of transform approved a liquidation plan. as of august 30, 2012, the operations of transform were substantially discontinued. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments transform" note.) manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, israel, italy, malaysia, puerto rico and singapore. our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan. in 2011, we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan to tower semiconductor ltd. ("tower") and entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may 2014. our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment. nand flash, dram and nor flash products share common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. we continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products. in 2012, most of our nand flash memory products were manufactured on our 25nm line-width process technology. we expect that for the second half of 2013 a majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured on our 20nm line-width process technology. in 2012, the majority of our dram production was manufactured on 42nm line-width process technology. we expect that for 2013 the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on 30nm line-width process technology. our nor flash memory products in 2012 were manufactured on our 65nm and 45nm line-width process technologies. in 2012, we manufactured all of our high-volume nand flash and dram products on 300mm wafers. we manufactured nor flash, some specialty dram and cmos image sensor products on 200mm wafers in 2012. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. after fabrication, most silicon wafers are separated into individual die. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms. for packaged products, functional die are sorted, connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages. we assemble products in a variety of packages, including tsop (thin small outline package), tqfp (thin quad flat package) and fbga (fine pitch ball grid array). bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility for use in packaging technologies such as system-in-a-package ("sips") and mcps, which reduce the board area required. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. we assemble a significant portion of our memory products into memory modules. memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices. we also contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices. 5 we utilize subcontractors to perform a portion of our assembly and module assembly services. outsourcing these services enables us to reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing process. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. availability of raw materials our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. marketing and customers our products are sold into computing, consumer, networking, telecommunications, automotive, industrial, and mobile markets. market concentrations from 2012 net sales were approximately as follows: computing (including desktop pcs, servers, notebooks and workstations), 25% ; consumer electronics, 20% ; mobile, 15% ; networking and storage, 10% ; and ssds, 10%. sales to intel, primarily nand flash products through im flash, were 12% of our net sales in 2012, 10% of our net sales in 2011, and 9% of our net sales in 2010. sales to hewlett-packard company, primarily of dram, were 8% of our net sales in 2012, 9% of our net sales in 2011 and 13% of our net sales in 2010. our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron, lexar , crucial , spectek and numonyx brand names and private labels. we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell lexar-branded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. 6 product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc.; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size and form factors. for our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricing. research and development our process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory (including mlc and tlc technologies), nor flash memory, specialty memory, phase-change memory, ssds and other memory technologies and systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $918 million, $791 million and $624 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. we generally share r&amp;d process and design costs for nand flash with intel and for dram with nanya. we also share r&amp;d costs for certain emerging memory technologies with intel. as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya cost-sharing arrangements, our overall r&amp;d expenses were reduced by $225 million, $236 million and $155 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. our process development center and largest design center are located at our corporate headquarters in boise, idaho. in 2012, we commenced operation of our new r&amp;d facility in boise, which was designed to accommodate 450mm wafer manufacturing. we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world. in addition, we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. 7 geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.0 billion for 2012 and included $2.9 billion in sales in china, $1.0 billion in sales in taiwan, $827 million in sales in europe, $546 million in sales in malaysia and $1.2 billion in sales in the rest of the asia pacific region (excluding china, malaysia and taiwan). sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.4 billion for 2011 and $7.1 billion for 2010. as of august 30, 2012, we had net property, plant and equipment of $3.3 billion in singapore, $3.2 billion in the united states, $328 million in china, $163 million in italy, $59 million in israel, and $37 million in other countries. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information" note and "item 1a. risk factors.") patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of august 30, 2012, we owned approximately 16,900 u.s. patents and 3,300 foreign patents. in addition, we have numerous u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2032. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. in recent years, we have recovered some of our investment in technology through sales or licenses of intellectual property rights to joint venture partners and other third parties. we are pursuing additional opportunities to recover our investment in intellectual property through additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and potential partnering arrangements. employees as of august 30, 2012, we had approximately 27,400 employees, of which approximately 16,000 were outside the united states, including approximately 7,800 in singapore, 3,400 in italy, 2,200 in china, 1,100 in israel and 1,000 in malaysia. our employees include approximately 1,600 in our imft joint venture, primarily located in the united states. our employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of our production, research and product and process development. many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees. the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. in 2012, our wholly-owned wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification. to continue certification, we met annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal. 8 as of august 30, 2012, the following executive officers

there are no family relationships between any of our directors or executive officers. 10 item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. dram trade nand flash* (percentage change in average selling prices) 2012 from 2011 (45 )% (55 )% 2011 from 2010 (39 )% (12 )% 2010 from 2009 28 % 26 % 2009 from 2008 (52 )% (52 )% 2008 from 2007 (51 )% (68 )% * trade nand flash excludes sales to intel from im flash. we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulty in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products. the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc.; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 11 the european financial crisis and overall downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. the european financial crisis and the overall downturn in the worldwide economy have had an adverse effect on our business. a continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, networking products and mobile devices. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices. a continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. inotera's financial situation may adversely impact the value of our interest and our supply agreement. due to significant market declines in the selling prices of dram, inotera incurred net losses of $259 million for its six-month period ended june 30, 2012 and $737 million for its fiscal year ended december 31, 2011. under generally accepted accounting principles in the republic of china, inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended september 30, 2012 of an additional new taiwan dollars 4,390 million (approximately $150 million u.s. dollars). in addition, inotera's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $1.85 billion as of june 30, 2012, which exposes inotera to liquidity risk. as of june 30, 2012 and december 31, 2011, inotera was also not in compliance with certain loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years, which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year. inotera obtained a waiver from complying with its financial covenants through june 30, 2012 and has requested an additional waiver from these requirements. inotera's management has developed plans to improve its liquidity. there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in obtaining an additional waiver or improving its liquidity. if inotera is unable to adequately improve its liquidity, we may have to impair our investment in inotera, which had a net carrying value of $321 million as of august 30, 2012 . in the second quarter of 2012, we contributed $170 million to inotera, which increased our ownership percentage from 29.7% to 39.7% . we may not continue to make equity contributions to inotera, which may further increase their liquidity risk. we have a supply agreement with inotera, under which nanya is also a party, for the rights and obligations to purchase 50% of inotera's wafer production capacity (the "inotera supply agreement"). as a result of our march 7, 2012 equity contribution to inotera, we expect to receive a higher share of inotera's 30-nanometer output when it becomes available as a result of inotera capital investments enabled by our $170 million equity investment. in the fourth quarter of 2012, we purchased $170 million of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 47% of our aggregate dram gigabit production. as a result, if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the following: we have experienced difficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera on our technology and may continue to experience difficulties and delays in the future; we may experience continued difficulties in transferring technology to inotera; costs associated with manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from underutilized capacity; difficulties in obtaining high yield and throughput due to differences in inotera's manufacturing processes from our other fabrication facilities; uncertainties around the timing and amount of wafer supply we will receive under the supply agreement; and the cost of our product obtained from inotera is impacted by nanya's revenue and back-end manufacturing costs for product obtained from inotera. 12 we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following: integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities; diverting management's attention from normal daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram, nand flash and nor flash products. resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of qimonda ag and the recent bankruptcy filing by elpida memory, inc. these types of proceedings often lead to confidential court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets. we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions, such as our pending acquisition of elpida. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our pending acquisitions of elpida and rexchip involve numerous risks. on july 2, 2012, we entered into a sponsor agreement with the trustees of the elpida companies that provides for, among other things, our acquisition of 100% of the equity of elpida. under the sponsor agreement, we committed to support plans of reorganization for the elpida companies that would provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of the elpida companies in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen (or approximately $2.5 billion ), less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items. as a condition of the sponsor agreement, we deposited 1.8 billion yen (or approximately $23 million) into an escrow account in july 2012 which will be applied to the share acquisition payments at closing. of the aggregate amount, we will fund 60 billion yen (or approximately $750 million ) through a cash payment to elpida at the closing, in exchange for 100% ownership of elpida's equity. the remaining 140 billion yen (or approximately $1.75 billion ) of payments will be made by the elpida companies in six annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014, with payments of 20 billion yen (or approximately $250 million ) in each of 2014 through 2017, and payments of 30 billion yen (or approximately $375 million ) in each of 2018 and 2019. on that same date, we entered into a share purchase agreement with powerchip and certain of its affiliates, under which we will purchase approximately 714 million shares of the common stock of rexchip, a manufacturing joint venture formed by elpida and powerchip, for approximately 10 billion new taiwan dollars (or approximately $334 million ). if the transactions contemplated by these two agreements are completed, we will own 100% of elpida and, directly or indirectly through elpida, approximately 89% of rexchip. 13 there can be no assurance that these transactions will close when expected or at all, or that the acquisition of elpida will ultimately be consummated on the terms and conditions set forth in the sponsor agreement. the transactions remain subject to bankruptcy and/or regulatory approval in various jurisdictions including the people's republic of china. these regulatory authorities may not approve the transactions or may impose modifications, conditions or restrictions that adversely impact the value of the transactions to micron. in addition, the proposed plan of reorganization of the trustees, which contemplates micron's acquisition of elpida pursuant to the sponsor agreement, remains subject to approval of both the court and the creditors of elpida, neither of which can be assured. various creditors are challenging the trustees' proposed plan of reorganization, and certain creditors have proposed an alternative plan of reorganization that does not contemplate micron's acquisition of elpida. if the requisite court and creditor approvals are not obtained, micron will not be able to close the acquisitions. in addition to the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor relating to acquisitions generally and to micron's ability to consummate the transaction described in the preceding paragraph, these acquisitions are expected to involve the following significant risks: continued deterioration of conditions in the semiconductor memory market threaten elpida's ability to pay its obligations; we may incur losses in connection with our support, including guarantees, of the elpida company's debtor-in-possession financing and capital expenditures, which losses may arise even if the transactions do not close; we are unable to maintain customers, successfully execute our integration strategies, or achieve planned synergies; we are unable to accurately forecast the anticipated financial results of the combined business; our consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transactions; increased exposure to the dram market, which experienced significant declines in pricing during 2012 and 2011; further deterioration of elpida's and rexchip's operations and customer base during the period between signing and closing; increased exposure to operating costs denominated in yen and new taiwan dollar; integration issues with elpida's and rexchip's primary manufacturing operations in japan and taiwan; integration issues of our product and process technology with elpida and rexchip; an overlap in customers; and restrictions on our ability to freely operate elpida as a result of contractual commitments as well as continued oversight by the court and trustee during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the elpida companies, which could last until all installment payments have been made. our pending acquisitions of elpida and rexchip are inherently risky, may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our pending acquisitions of elpida and rexchip expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange rates. under the sponsor agreement, we committed to support plans of reorganization for elpida that would provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen. also, under the share purchase agreement with powerchip, we agreed to pay approximately 10 billion new taiwan dollars to purchase approximately 714 million shares of rexchip common stock. these payments in yen and new taiwan dollars expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange rates. on july 2, 2012, we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 200 billion yen with a weighted-average strike price of 79.15 (yen per dollar). in addition, to reduce the cost of these call options, we sold put options to sell 100 billion yen with a strike price of 83.32 and we sold call options to buy 100 billion yen with a strike price of 75.57 . the net cost of these call and put options, which expire on april 3, 2013, of $49 million is payable upon settlement. these currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening yen for our yen-denominated payments under the sponsor agreement while preserving some ability for us to benefit if the value of the yen weakens relative to the u.s. dollar. on july 25, 2012, we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 10 billion new taiwan dollars with a weighted-average strike price of 29.21 (new taiwan dollars per u.s. dollars). the net cost of these options, which expire on april 2, 2013, of $3 million is payable upon settlement. these currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening new taiwan dollar for our payments under the rexchip share purchase agreement. these yen and new taiwan dollar option contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and are remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses reflected in our results of operations. therefore, changes in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the yen and the new taiwan dollar could have a significant impact on our results of operations. 14 the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda ag ("qimonda") insolvency proceedings, filed suit against us and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary, in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between us and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the inotera shares purchased from qimonda to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. a three-judge panel will render a decision after a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments and witnesses. a first hearing was held on september 25, 2012. the next hearing is scheduled for february 5, 2013. we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. as of august 30, 2012, the inotera shares purchased from qimonda had a net carrying value of $177 million. our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies. our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram, nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies . there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d and product and process technology. we estimate that capital spending for 2013 will be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion. as of august 30, 2012 , we had cash and equivalents of $2,459 million and short-term investments of $ 100 million . cash and investments included $157 million held by imft, which is generally not available to finance our other operations. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed . as a result of our current debt levels, general economic conditions and adverse conditions in the credit markets , it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 15 debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. we are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation, any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. in recent periods, our debt levels have increased and are expected to continue to increase through 2013. as of august 30, 2012 , we had $3.3 billion of debt, including $949 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2014. in september and october 2012, we entered into financing arrangements that allow for borrowings up to $469 million. in addition, if we are able to complete the elpida acquisition, we will fund 60 billion yen (or approximately $750 million) through a cash payment to elpida at the closing, in exchange for 100% ownership of elpida's equity. the remaining 140 billion yen (or approximately $1.75 billion) of payments will be made by the elpida companies in six annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014, with payments of 20 billion yen (or approximately $250 million) in each of 2014 through 2017, and payments of 30 billion yen (or approximately $375 million) in each of 2018 and 2019. we may need to incur additional debt in the future. our debt could adversely impact us. for example it could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, including the convertible notes, which will reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditures and other business activities; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, research and development and other general corporate requirements; contribute to a future downgrade of our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the convertible notes and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the convertible notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our payment obligations under the convertible notes and our other debt. our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks. we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these arrangements include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel, our inotera dram joint venture with nanya, our mp mask joint venture with photronics, our transform joint venture with origin energy and our cmos image sensor wafer supply agreement with aptina . these joint ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in our joint venture; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; we may need to continue to recognize our share of losses from inotera or transform in our future results of operations; due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment by our joint ventures, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us: for example, our contributions to imfs in 2011 and 2010 totaled $1,708 million while intel's contributions totaled $38 million and in 2012 we paid intel approximately $600 million to acquire its interests in two nand flash fabrication facilities; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements; the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. specifically, as a result of a liquidation plan approved by the board of directors of transform in may 2012, we recognized a charge of $69 million . 16 an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on may 5, 2004, rambus, inc. ("rambus") filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california (san francisco county) against us and other dram suppliers which alleged that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips. rambus' complaint alleged various causes of action under california state law including, among other things, a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices, a conspiracy to monopolize, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and unfair competition. rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately $3.9 billion, joint and several liability, trebling of damages awarded, punitive damages, a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint, interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. trial began on june 20, 2011, and the case went to the jury on september 21, 2011. on november 16, 2011, the jury found for us on all claims. on april 2, 2012, rambus filed a notice of appeal to the california 1st district court of appeal. we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter. an adverse court determination of any lawsuit alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on january 13, 2006, rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2, ddr3, rldram, and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages, treble damages, and injunctive relief. the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales. on june 2, 2006, we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging, among other things, antitrust and fraud claims. on january 9, 2009, in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware, judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us. rambus subsequently appealed the delaware court's decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. on may 13, 2011, the federal circuit affirmed judge robinson's finding of spoliation, but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the delaware district court for analysis of the remedy based on the federal circuit's decision. the northern district of california court stayed the trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the federal circuit. in addition, others have asserted, and may assert in the future, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. (see "item 3. legal proceedings" for additional details on these lawsuits.) we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. if problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products, we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required to replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product, and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. 17 new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete. in recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram, nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors. the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants. some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation. in addition, some governments have provided, and may be considering providing, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. we may incur additional material restructure charges in future periods. in response to severe downturns in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions, we implemented restructure plans in prior periods and may need to implement restructure initiatives in future periods. as a result, we could incur restructure charges, lose production output, lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products. the limited availability of raw materials, supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor equipment, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 18 our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited. we have a valuation allowance against substantially all u.s. net deferred tax assets. as of august 30, 2012, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $3.5 billion , $2.2 billion and $737 million , respectively. if not utilized, substantially all of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2023 to 2032 and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017. as of august 30, 2012, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were $208 million and $203 million respectively. if not utilized, substantially all of our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2013 to 2032. as a consequence of prior business acquisitions, utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income. the determination of these tax limitations is complex and requires a significant amount of judgment by us with respect to analysis of past transactions. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the singapore dollar, euro, shekel and yen. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $6 million for 2012, $6 million for 2011 and $23 million for 2010. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately u.s. $8 million as of august 30, 2012 and u.s. $9 million as of september 1, 2011. in the event that the u.s. dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar, euro, shekel or yen, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. in connection with the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement, we entered into currency option transactions to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen and new taiwan dollar payments. we estimate that, as of august 30, 2012, a 10% decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately u.s. $108 million for these currency options. additionally, we estimate that, as of august 30, 2012, a 10% decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with u.s. dollar would result in a decrease of u.s. $239 million of our planned payments under the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 85% of our consolidated net sales for 2012. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export control laws and similar rules and regulations; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels; disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 19 if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. additionally, our control over operations at our imft, inotera and mp mask joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. breaches of our network security could expose us to losses. we manage and store on our network systems, various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. we also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data for our customers, including sensitive personal information. computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, foreign currency option and forward contracts, and capped-call contracts on our stock. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of august 30, 2012 , $ 3,087 million of our $ 3,262 million of debt was at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. the estimated fair value of our debt was $ 3,622 million as of august 30, 2012 and $ 2,281 million as of september 1, 2011 . we estimate that, as of august 30, 2012 , a 1% decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed-rate debt instruments by approximately $ 88 million . as of august 30, 2012 , $ 175 million of the debt had variable interest rates. the increase in interest expense caused by a 1% increase in the rates would be approximately $2 million . as of august 30, 2012 , we held short-term debt investments of $100 million and long-term debt investments of $364 million that were subject to interest rate risk. we estimate that, as of august 30, 2012 , a 0.5% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our short-term and long-term debt instruments by approximately $3 million. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in "item 1a. risk factors." changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. as a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the shekel, the yen and the yuan. we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs. our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately u.s. $8 million as of august 30, 2012 and u.s. $9 million as of september 1, 2011. to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature from 12 to 18 months. 42 in connection with the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement, we may be required to make aggregate payments of 200 billion yen and approximately 10 billion new taiwan dollars. of the aggregate amount, 60 billion yen and approximately 10 billion new taiwan dollars will be due at the closing of the transactions and the remaining 140 billion yen amounts will be made by the elpida companies in annual installments from 2014 through 2019. (see "item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements elpida memory, inc. ) these payments are contingent upon the closing of the transaction and are therefore not recorded on our balance sheet as of august 30, 2012. changes in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the yen and the new taiwan dollar could have a significant impact on our financial statements if the transactions are consummated. to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen and new taiwan dollar payments, we entered into currency option transactions. these currency options did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in other operating income (loss). (see "item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements derivative financial instruments. ) we estimate that, as of august 30, 2012, a 10% decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately u.s. $108 million for these currency options. additionally, we estimate that, as of august 30, 2012, a 10% decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with u.s. dollar would result in a decrease of u.s. $239 million of our planned payments under the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement. 43risk factors." all period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. corporate information micron technology, inc., a delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1978. as used herein, "we," "our," "us" and similar terms include micron technology, inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. our executive offices are located at 8000 south federal way, boise, idaho 83716-9632 and our telephone number is (208) 368-4000. information about us is available on the internet at www.micron.com. copies of our annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q and current reports on form 8-k, as well as any amendments to these reports, are available through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission (the "sec"). materials filed by us with the sec are also available at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, d.c. 20549. information on the operation of the public reference room is available by calling (800) sec-0330. also available on our website are our: corporate governance guidelines, governance committee charter, compensation committee charter, audit committee charter and code of business conduct and ethics. any amendments or waivers of our code of business conduct and ethics will also be posted on our website at www.micron.com within four business days of the amendment or waiver. copies of these documents are available to shareholders upon request. information contained or referenced on our website is not incorporated by reference and does not form a part of this annual report on form 10-k. overview we are one of the world's leading providers of advanced semiconductor solutions. through our worldwide operations, we manufacture and market a full range of dram, nand flash and nor flash memory, as well as other innovative memory technologies, packaging solutions and semiconductor systems for use in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking, automotive, industrial, embedded and mobile products. we market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("oems") and retailers located around the world. our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generating a return on research and development ("r&amp;d") investments. we obtain products from three primary sources: (1) production from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities, (2) production from our joint venture manufacturing facilities, and (3) to a lesser degree, from third party manufacturers. in recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements, including joint ventures. 1 we make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technologies that are implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and through our joint ventures. these investments enable our production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs. we generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as our leading-edge line-width process technology and innovative array architecture. we continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/ write reliability and increased memory density. to leverage our significant investments in r&amp;d, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners. in addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties. we continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. on july 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of elpida memory, inc. ("elpida"), a japanese corporation, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies (as amended, the "sponsor agreement") that we entered into on july 2, 2012, with the trustees of elpida and one of its subsidiaries, akita elpida memory, inc., a japanese corporation ("akita" and, together with elpida, the "elpida companies") pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies' corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan. we paid $615 million for the acquisition of 100% of elpida's equity. on july 31, 2013, we also acquired a 24% ownership interest in rexchip electronics corporation ("rexchip"), a taiwanese corporation and manufacturing joint venture formed by powerchip technology corporation ("powerchip") and elpida, from powerchip and certain of its affiliates (the "powerchip group") pursuant to a share purchase agreement. we paid $334 million in cash for the shares. elpida and its subsidiaries (the "elpida group") own approximately 65% of rexchip's outstanding common stock. therefore, as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group, we own approximately 89% of rexchip's common stock. the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include, among other items, cash and restricted cash aggregating $1,618 million; inventories of $962 million; property, plant and equipment of $935 million; net deferred tax assets of $917 million and debt of $2,134 million. elpida's assets include, among others: a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima, japan; its approximate 65% ownership interest in rexchip, whose assets include a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in taichung city, taiwan; and a 100% ownership interest in akita, whose assets include an assembly and test facility located in akita, japan. elpida's semiconductor memory products include mobile dram, targeted toward mobile phones and tablets. we believe that combining the complementary product portfolios of micron and elpida will strengthen our position in the memory market and enable us to provide customers with a wider portfolio of high-quality memory solutions. we also believe that our acquisition of elpida will strengthen our market position in the memory industry through increased research and development and manufacturing scale, improved access to core memory market segments, and additional wafer capacity to balance among our dram, nand flash and nor flash memory solutions. elpida's operations are included primarily in the dsg and wsg segments. the elpida companies are currently subject to corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan. because the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the elpida acquisition, these proceedings are continuing, and the elpida companies remain subject to the oversight of the tokyo district court (the "japan court") and of the trustees appointed by the japan court (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the reorganization proceedings. as a result of this oversight and related consent rights of the japan court and the legal trustee, our ability to effectively integrate the elpida companies as part of our global operations or to cause the elpida companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions. for more information, see "part i, item 1a. risk factors" and "part i, item 3. legal proceedings reorganization proceedings of the elpida companies." 2 business segments we have the following four reportable segments: dram solutions group ("dsg"): includes dram products sold to the pc, consumer electronics, networking and server markets. nand solutions group ("nsg"): includes high-volume nand flash products sold into data storage, personal music players and the high-density computing market, as well as nand flash products sold to intel corporation ("intel") through our im flash joint venture. wireless solutions group

products sold into automotive and industrial applications, as well as nor and nand flash sold to consumer electronics, networking, pc and server markets. our other operations do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other. for more information regarding our segments, see "part i, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements segment information." products dynamic random access memory ("dram") dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval. dram sales products were 48%, 39% and 41% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. dram products are sold by our dsg, wsg and esg segments and are used in computers, servers, tablets, mobile phones, communication equipment, computer peripherals, industrial, automotive and other electronic devices. we offer dram products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics including high-volume ddr4, ddr3 and ddr2 products as well as specialty dram memory products including mobile low power dram ("lpdram"), ddr, sdram, reduced latency dram ("rldram") and pseudo-static dram ("psram"). ddr4, ddr3 and ddr2 : ddr4, ddr3 and ddr2 are standardized, high-density, high-volume, dram products. ddr4, ddr3 and ddr2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost. ddr3 sales were 31%, 20% and 21% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. ddr2 sales were 7%, 9% and 10% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. we began sampling ddr4 products in 2013 and expect to begin commercial production of ddr4 products in significant volumes during 2014. in 2013, we offered ddr3 products in 1gb, 2gb and 4gb densities and ddr2 products in 512 megabit ("mb"), 1 gigabit ("gb") and 2gb densities. these densities enable us to meet customer demands for a broad array of products and we offered these products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types. specialty dram products : we also offer dram memory products including ddr and ddr2 mobile lpdram, ddr, sdram, rldram and psram in densities ranging from 64mb to 4gb. lpdram products are used primarily in mobile phones, tablets, embedded applications, ultra-thin laptop computers and other mobile consumer devices that require low power consumption. our other specialty dram products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, computer peripherals, automotive and industrial applications as well as computer memory upgrades. in september 2013, we began sampling hybrid memory cube ("hmc") products, which are are semiconductor memory devices where vertical stacks of dram die that are connected using through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer. hmc enables ultra-high system performance with significantly lower power-per-bit. aggregate sales of lpdram and our other specialty dram products were 10% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011. 3 nand flash memory nand flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand flash sales were 40%, 44% and 36% of our total net sales in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. nand flash products are sold by our nsg, wsg and esg segments. nand flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories. embedded nand flash-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, solid-state drives ("ssds"), tablets, computers, industrial and automotive applications, mp3/4 players and other personal and consumer applications. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash memory cards, are used with applications such as pcs, digital still cameras, mp3/4 players and mobile phones. the market for nand flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to demand for these and other removable and embedded storage devices. our nand flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we offer single-level cell ("slc") nand flash products as well as multi-level cell ("mlc") and triple-level cell ("tlc") nand flash products, which have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of slc nand flash products. in 2013, we offered slc nand products in 1 gb to 64gb densities. in addition, we offered 8gb to 128gb 2-bit-per-cell mlc nand flash products and 32gb to 128gb 3-bit-per-cell tlc nand flash products. we offer high-speed nand flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces. we offer client and enterprise ssds which feature higher performance, reduced power consumption and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. our client ssds are targeted at notebook and other consumer applications. using our nand flash process technology and a leading-edge sata 6 gb/s interface, our ssds deliver read and write speeds that help improve boot and application load times and deliver higher performance than hard disk drives. our client ssds are offered in 2.5-inch and 1.8-inch form factors, with densities up to 960 gigabytes ("gb"). our enterprise ssds are targeted at server applications and incorporate our extended performance and enhanced reliability technology (xpert) architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements. the end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency. we offer enterprise ssds with capacities up to 1.4 terabytes. we expect that demand for both client and enterprise ssds will continue to increase significantly over the next several years. we also offer managed nand and nand-based multichip packages ("mcps") products, which incorporate our nand flash. our managed nand products combine nand flash with a logic controller that performs media management and error code correction ("ecc"), which provides reduced ecc complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration, and lower overall system costs. our managed nand products include e-mmc memory, embedded usb, and clearnand. our nand-based mcps combine nand flash with dram and/or other memory devices in a single package, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design. through our lexar brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and oem channels. our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and jumpdrive products with a range of speeds, capacities and value-added features. we offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including: compactflash, memory stick and secure digital ("sd"). compactflash and memory stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. other products, including sd memory cards and some jumpdrive products, incorporate third party controllers. we also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other nand flash suppliers. 4 nor flash memory nor flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off, offer fast read times due to random access capability and have execute-in-place ("xip") capability that enables processors to read nor flash without first accessing ram. these capabilities make nor ideal for storing program code in wireless and embedded applications. our nor flash sales were 9%, 12% and 18% of our total net sales for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. nor flash products are sold by our wsg and esg segments. we offer both parallel and serial interface nor flash products in a broad range of densities, packages and features. our parallel nor flash products are constructed to meet the needs of the consumer electronics, industrial, wired and wireless communications, computing and automotive applications. these products offer high densities, xip performance, architectural flexibility and proven

arrangements as of august 29, 2013: member or partner micron ownership interest formed/ acquired product market consolidated entities imft (1) intel corporation 51% 2006 nand flash mp mask (2) photronics, inc. 50% 2006 photomasks equity method investments inotera (3) nanya technology corporation 35% 2009 dram tera probe (4) various 40% 2013 wafer probe (1) imft: we partner with intel for the design, development and manufacture of nand flash and certain emerging memory products. in connection therewith, we formed a joint venture with intel, im flash technologies, llc ("imft"), to manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive use of the members. the members share the output of imft generally in proportion to their investment. we sell nand flash products to intel through imft at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. we generally share product design and other research and development costs for nand flash and certain emerging memory technologies equally with intel. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated variable interest entities im flash" note.) (2) mp mask: we produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask technology center, llc ("mp mask"), a joint venture with photronics, inc. ("photronics"). we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements consolidated variable interest entities mp mask" note.) 5 (3) inotera: we partner with nanya technology corporation ("nanya") for the manufacture of dram products, and through december 2012, the joint development of dram process technology. in connection therewith, we have partnered with nanya in a dram memory company in taiwan, inotera memories, inc. ("inotera"). through december 2012, we had a supply agreement with inotera and nanya which gave us the right and obligation to purchase 50% of inotera's semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions. under the formula for this supply agreement, all parties' manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera, as well as our and nanya's revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera, were considered in determining costs for wafers purchased by us from inotera. effective beginning january 2013, we are obligated to purchase for an initial period through january 2016, substantially all of inotera's output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components. in connection with the partnering agreement, we have also deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya. through december 2012, we partnered with nanya to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture dram products under a cost-sharing arrangement effective beginning in april 2010, under which we shared dram development costs with nanya. effective beginning january 2013, nanya ceased participating in the joint development program. we receive royalties from nanya for sales of dram products manufactured by or for nanya with technology developed prior to april 2010. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments inotera" note.) (4) tera probe: we have an approximate 40% ownership in tera probe, inc., an entity that provides semiconductor probe and test services. tera probe provides wafer probe services for our elpida and rexchip subsidiaries. manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, israel, japan, malaysia, puerto rico, singapore and taiwan. our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan. in september 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell our 200mm wafer fabrication equipment in kiryat gat, israel to intel and to terminate the related facility lease with intel. if this transaction is completed, intel will manufacture wafers for us at the kiryat gat facility through 2014 through a series of arrangements. in 2011, we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan to tower semiconductor ltd. ("tower") and entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may 2014. our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment. nand flash, dram and nor flash products share common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. we continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products. in 2013, the majority of our dram production was manufactured on 30nm line-width process technology. in connection with our acquisition of elpida, we expect in 2014 that a significant portion of our dram production will be manufactured on 25nm line-width process technology. in the fourth quarter of 2013, a majority of our nand flash memory products were manufactured on our 20nm line-width process technology. we expect to begin transitioning our nand flash production to our 16nm line-width process technology in 2014. our nor flash memory products in 2013 were manufactured on our 65nm and 45nm line-width process technologies. we manufacture all of our high-volume nand flash and dram products on 300mm wafers. in 2013, we manufactured nor flash, some specialty dram and non-memory products on 200mm wafers. 6 wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms. our packaged products include memory modules, mcp's, managed nand, ssds, memory cards and usb devices. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, we outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. availability of raw materials our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases including helium , photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. marketing and customers our products are sold into computing, consumer, networking, telecommunications, automotive, industrial, and mobile markets. market concentrations from 2013 net sales were approximately as follows: computing (including desktop pcs, servers, notebooks and workstations), 30% ; mobile, 15% ; consumer electronics, 15% ; ssds, 15% and networking and storage, 10% . sales to intel, primarily nand flash products through im flash, were 10% of our net sales in 2013, 12% of our net sales in 2012, and 10% of our net sales in 2011. sales to hewlett-packard company, primarily of dram, were 10% of our net sales in 2013, 8% of our net sales in 2012 and 9% of our net sales in 2011. we expect that our acquisition of elpida will increase our concentration of sales to mobile, graphics and computing markets in 2014. our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron, lexar , crucial , spectek and elpida brand names and private labels. we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell lexar-branded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc.; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size and form factors. for our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricing. research and development our process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies, as well as new fundamentally different memory structures, materials and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory (including mlc and tlc technologies), nor flash memory, specialty memory, ssds , hybrid memory cubes and other memory technologies and systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $931 million, $918 million and $791 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. we generally share r&amp;d process and design costs for nand flash with intel. we also share r&amp;d costs for certain emerging memory technologies with intel. we generally shared r&amp;d process and design costs for dram with nanya through december 2012, when our cost-sharing agreement was terminated. as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya cost-sharing arrangements, our overall r&amp;d expenses were reduced by $146 million, $225 million and $236 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 7 to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. our process, design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest r&amp;d centers located in boise, idaho and hiroshima, japan. our largest design center is also located at our corporate headquarters in boise, idaho. we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world. in 2012, we commenced operation of our new r&amp;d facility in boise, which was designed to accommodate 450mm wafer manufacturing. in addition, we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.6 billion for 2013 and included $3.8 billion in sales in china, $980 million in sales in taiwan, $820 million in sales in europe, $193 million in sales in malaysia and $1.3 billion in sales in the rest of the asia pacific region (excluding china, malaysia and taiwan). sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.0 billion for 2012 and $7.4 billion for 2011. as of august 29, 2013, we had net property, plant and equipment of $3.2 billion in singapore, $3.0 billion in the united states, $615 million in japan, $350 million in china, $307 million in taiwan, $28 million in israel, $18 million in italy and $42 million in other countries. (see "item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information" note and "item 1a. risk factors.") patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of august 29, 2013 , we owned approximately 16,200 u.s. patents and 3,700 foreign patents. in addition, we have numerous u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2032. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and potential partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. employees as of august 29, 2013, we had approximately 30,900 employees, of which approximately 19,600 were outside the united states, including approximately 7,500 in singapore, 3,700 in japan, 2,700 in china, 2,100 in taiwan, 1,100 in italy, 1,000 in israel and 1,000 in malaysia. our employees include approximately 1,700 in our imft joint venture, primarily located in the united states and 5,700 from our acquisition of elpida and rexchip, primarily located in japan and taiwan. in september 2013, we entered into an agreement to sell our 200mm wafer fabrication equipment in kiryat gat, israel to intel and to terminate the related facility lease with intel. if this transaction is completed, most of our employees in israel will terminate their employment with us and be transferred to intel. as of august 29, 2013, we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for this restructure activity. our employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of our production, research and product and process development. many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees. the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 8 environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. in 2013, our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification. to continue certification, we met annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal. as of august 29, 2013, the

could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. dram trade nand flash* (percentage change in average selling prices) 2013 from 2012 (11)% (18)% 2012 from 2011 (45)% (55)% 2011 from 2010 (39)% (12)% 2010 from 2009 28% 26% 2009 from 2008 (52)% (52)% * trade nand flash excludes sales to intel from im flash. we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulty in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products. the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc.; spansion inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 12 our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip involve numerous risks. on july 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of elpida, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2, 2012, with the trustees of the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies' pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan. we paid $615 million for the acquisition of 100% of elpida's equity. on july 31, 2013, we also acquired a 24% ownership interest in rexchip from the powerchip group pursuant to a share purchase agreement. we paid $334 million in cash for the shares. the elpida group owns approximately 65% of rexchip's outstanding common stock. therefore, as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group, we own approximately 89% of rexchip's common stock. the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include, among other items, cash and restricted cash aggregating $1,618 million, inventories of $962 million; property, plant and equipment of $935 million; net deferred tax assets of $917 million and debt of $2,134 million. in addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere, these acquisitions are expected to involve the following significant risks: we may be unable to maintain customers, successfully execute our integration strategies, or achieve planned synergies; we may be unable to accurately forecast the anticipated financial results of the combined business; our consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transactions; increased exposure to the dram market, which experienced significant declines in pricing during the first quarter of 2013 as well as 2012 and 2011; deterioration of elpida's and rexchip's operations and customer base following closing; increased exposure to operating costs denominated in yen and new taiwan dollar; integration issues with elpida's and rexchip's primary manufacturing operations in japan and taiwan; integration issues of our product and process technology with elpida and rexchip; integration of business systems and processes; and an overlap in customers. our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip are inherently risky, may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the operations of the elpida companies will be subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings. because the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of elpida, the japan proceedings are continuing, and the elpida companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the japan proceedings. the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the elpida companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition. during the pendency of the japan proceedings, the elpida companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies. accordingly, during the pendency of the japan proceedings, our ability to effectively integrate the elpida companies as part of our global operations or to cause the elpida companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the elpida companies. 13 our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange rates. under the sponsor agreement, we committed to support plans of reorganization for elpida that provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen. the u.s. dollar amount of this payment obligation could increase if the yen strengthens against the u.s. dollar. additionally, a significant portion of elpida's and rexchip's operating costs are paid in yen and new taiwan dollars so our operating results subsequent to the acquisition could also be adversely impacted if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar. our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip may increase our risk of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. elpida and rexchip have not performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of their internal control over financial reporting. in addition, elpida and rexchip have not historically prepared their financial statements under u.s. generally accepted accounting standards. elpida and rexchip were not required to be included in our assessment of internal controls for 2013 but will be included in our assessment for 2014, which may increase our risk for material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. we are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation, any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. in recent periods, our debt levels have increased. as of august 29, 2013, we had $6.0 billion of debt, including $485 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2014. as of august 29, 2013, we had two credit facilities available that provides for up to $408 million of additional financing, subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions. events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities. we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments, including debt incurred in connection with asset-backed financing. the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen (or the equivalent of approximately $2.05 billion), less certain expenses of the japan proceedings and certain other items. if the resolution of certain unfixed claims under the plans of reorganization, primarily comprised of outstanding litigation claims, would result in payments in respect of those claims in excess of amounts reserved under the plans of reorganization to satisfy such claims, there is a possibility that the elpida companies would be required to pay more than 200 billion yen to their pre-petition creditors under the plans of reorganization. in addition, if these unfixed claims are resolved pursuant to settlement arrangements or other post-petition agreements, a substantial portion of the amounts payable with respect to the claims may have to be funded by the elpida companies outside of the installment payments provided for by the plans of reorganization. our debt and our guarantee obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditures and other business activities; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, research and development and other general corporate requirements; contribute to a future downgrade of our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 14 we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d and product and process technology. we estimate that capital spending for 2014 will be approximately $2.6 billion to $3.2 billion. in addition, as a result of the elpida acquisition, we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the elpida transaction. as of august 29, 2013, we had cash and equivalents of $2,880 million, short-term investments of $221 million and long-term marketable investments of $499 million. cash and investments included $1,094 million held by elpida and its consolidated subsidiaries and $62 million held by im flash technologies, llc ("imft"), none of which is generally available to finance our other operations. as a result of the japan proceedings, for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans and advances. the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies prohibit the elpida companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the elpida companies' installment payments. these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the elpida companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the elpida companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the elpida companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the elpida companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the elpida companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court. as a result, the assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the elpida companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures and other operating needs of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us in our other operations. moreover, certain uses of the assets of the elpida companies, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in rexchip, may require consent of elpida's trustees and/or the japan court. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our current debt levels, expected debt amortization and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by elpida to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks. on january 17, 2013, we entered into a new supply agreement with inotera (the "inotera supply agreement") under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of inotera's output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the following: higher costs for supply obtained under the market-based provisions of the inotera supply agreement; difficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera and delays in the future; and difficulties in transferring technology to inotera. inotera's financial situation may adversely impact the value of our interest and our supply agreement. as of june 30, 2013, inotera's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $1.0 billion , which exposes inotera to liquidity risk. additionally, inotera incurred net losses of $541 million for its fiscal year ended december 31, 2012. as of june 30, 2013, inotera was not in compliance with certain loan covenants, and had not been in compliance for the past several years, which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year. inotera has applied for a waiver from complying with the june 30, 2013 financial covenants. inotera's management has implemented plans to improve its liquidity and for its six-month period ended june 30, 2013, inotera generated net income of $91 million ; however, there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in sufficiently improving its liquidity and complying with their loan covenants, which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year. if inotera is unable to continue to improve its liquidity, we may have to impair our investment in inotera. 15 on january 17, 2013, we entered into agreements with nanya technology corporation ("nanya") to amend the joint venture relationship involving inotera. under the inotera supply agreement we purchase substantially all of inotera's output at a purchase price based on a discount from actual market prices for comparable components. the inotera supply agreement was retroactively effective beginning on january 1, 2013. for the fourth quarter of 2013, we purchased $518 million of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 50% of our aggregate dram gigabit production. if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the singapore dollar, euro, shekel and yen. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $229 million for 2013, $6 million for 2012 and $6 million for 2011. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $19 million as of august 29, 2013. in the event that the u.s. dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar, euro, shekel or yen, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. in connection with the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement, we entered into currency hedges to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen payments. in 2013, we recognized losses of $228 million on these hedges and made payments of $222 million to settle these hedges. as of august 29, 2013, to hedge certain yen-denominated payments resulting from our acquisition of elpida, we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28, 2014 at a yen per u.s. dollar exchange rate of 98.53 and a forward contract to purchase 10 billion yen on november 27, 2015 at a yen per u.s. dollar exchange rate of 97.25. the financial crisis and overall downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. the financial crisis and the overall downturn in the worldwide economy have had an adverse effect on our business. a continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business, including any economic downturn resulting from the shutdown of the u.s. federal government or any default by the u.s. federal government on any of its debt or other obligations. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, networking products and mobile devices. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we may incur additional material restructure or other charges in future periods. in response to severe downturns in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions, we implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods. we may restructure or dispose of assets as we continue to optimize our manufacturing operations, including the wind-down of 200-millimeter wafer capacity as we migrate more products to 300-millimeter wafer production. as a result, we could incur restructure charges (including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits, losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other long-lived assets and inventory write downs), lose production output, lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products. in connection with these actions, we recorded $126 million in 2013 and may incur restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods. we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following: integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; 16 the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities; diverting management's attention from normal daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram, nand flash and nor flash products. resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of qimonda ag and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida memory, inc. these types of proceedings often lead to confidential court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets. we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies. our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram, nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies . there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. 17 the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda ag ("qimonda") insolvency proceedings, filed suit against us and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary, in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between us and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the inotera shares purchased from qimonda to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. a three-judge panel will render a decision after a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments and witnesses. hearings were held on september 25, 2012, february 5, 2013, june 11, 2013 and july 2, 2013. an additional hearing is scheduled for november 12, 2013. we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. as of august 29, 2013, the inotera shares purchased from qimonda had a carrying value of $190 million. our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks. we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these relationships include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel corporation ("intel"), our inotera dram joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in our joint venture; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; we may recognize losses from equity investment inotera in our future results of operations; due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment by our joint ventures, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements; we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners; the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. 18 an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on may 5, 2004, rambus, inc. ("rambus") filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california (san francisco county) against us and other dram suppliers which alleged that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips. rambus' complaint alleged various causes of action under california state law including, among other things, a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices, a conspiracy to monopolize, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and unfair competition. rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately $3.9 billion, joint and several liability, trebling of damages awarded, punitive damages, a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint, interest, and attorneys' fees and costs. trial began on june 20, 2011, and the case went to the jury on september 21, 2011. on november 16, 2011, the jury found for us on all claims. on april 2, 2012, rambus filed a notice of appeal to the california 1st district court of appeal. we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter. an adverse court determination of any lawsuit alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. on january 13, 2006, rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2, ddr3, rldram, and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages, treble damages, and injunctive relief. the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales. on june 2, 2006, we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging, among other things, antitrust and fraud claims. on january 9, 2009, in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware, judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us. rambus subsequently appealed the delaware court's decision to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. on may 13, 2011, the federal circuit affirmed judge robinson's finding of spoliation, but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the delaware district court for analysis of the remedy based on the federal circuit's decision. on january 2, 2013, judge robinson entered a new opinion in our favor holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation, that rambus' spoliation was done in bad faith, that the spoliation prejudiced us, and that the appropriate sanction was to declare the twelve rambus patents in the suit unenforceable against us. on march 27, 2013, rambus filed a notice of appeal to the u.s. court of appeals for the federal circuit. the northern district of california court stayed the trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the federal circuit. in addition, others have asserted, and may assert in the future, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. (see "item 1. legal proceedings" for additional details on these lawsuits.) we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: 19 we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace products; we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the u.s., singapore, taiwan, japan, israel and china. additionally, our control over operations at our imft, inotera and mp mask and tera probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete. in recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram, nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors. the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants and significant recent consolidation and, in certain cases, liquidation. some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation. in addition, some governments have provided, and may be considering providing, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. the limited availability of raw materials, supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases including helium, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 20 our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor equipment, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster, fire, chemical explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited. we have a valuation allowance against substantially all u.s. net deferred tax assets as well as $1.5 billion related to our foreign subsidiaries. as of august 29, 2013, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were $4.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. if not utilized, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2033. as of august 29, 2013, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were $238 million and $203 million, respectively. if not utilized, our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2033. as of august 29, 2013, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $7.0 billion, of which $5.9 billion pertains to elpida. we have placed a valuation allowance against $4.7 billion of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards, of which $3.8 billion pertains to elpida. if not utilized, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2023. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 83% of our consolidated net sales for 2013. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export control laws and similar rules and regulations; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels; disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 21 breaches of our network security could expose us to losses. we manage and store on our network systems, various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. we also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data for our customers, including sensitive personal information. computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, foreign currency option and forward contracts, and capped-call contracts on our stock. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act"), and its implementing sec regulations. the dodd-frank act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. substantially all of our indebtedness was at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of august 29, 2013 and august 30, 2012, a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our convertible notes and other notes by approximately $147 million and $88 million, respectively. the increase in interest expense caused by a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate note would not be significant. as of august 29, 2013 and august 30, 2012, we held debt securities of $787 million and $464 million, respectively, that were subject to interest rate risk. we estimate that a 0.5% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately $4 million as of august 29, 2013 and $3 million as of august 30, 2012. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in "item 1a. risk factors." changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. as a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and carry certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the shekel, the yen and the yuan. we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs. our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately u.s. $19 million as of august 29, 2013 and u.s. $8 million as of august 30, 2012 . to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature from 12 to 18 months. under the terms and conditions of the elpida companies' respective plans of reorganization, the elpida companies are obligated to pay 200 billion yen (or the equivalent of $ 2.05 billion based on exchange rates as of august 29, 2013), less certain expenses of their reorganization proceedings and certain other items, to the secured and unsecured creditors (the "elpida creditor installment payments") in respect of the elpida companies' pre-petition creditors and their related claims. substantially all of the $615 million we paid in connection with the acquisition of elpida was deposited into accounts that are legally restricted for payment to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in october 2013. the remaining 140 billion yen is due in six annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014, with payments of 20 billion yen in each of 2014 through 2017, and payments of 30 billion yen in each of 2018 and 2019. to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on the payments due in 2014 and 2015, we entered into forward contracts to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28, 2014 and 10 billion yen on november 27, 2015. in addition, the elpida companies' cash and equivalent balances in yen mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the yen remaining installment payments due in 2015 and after. (see "item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements debt.") changes in the exchange rate between the u.s. dollar and the yen could have a significant impact on our financial statements. 51risk factors." all period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. corporate information micron, a delaware corporation, was incorporated

contained or referenced on our website is not incorporated by reference and does not form a part of this annual report on form 10-k. overview we are one of the world's leading providers of advanced semiconductor solutions. through our worldwide operations, we manufacture and market a full range of dram, nand flash and nor flash memory, as well as other innovative memory technologies, packaging solutions and semiconductor systems for use in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking, automotive, industrial, embedded and mobile products. we market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers ("oems") and retailers located around the world. our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced product and process technologies and generating a return on r&amp;d investments. we obtain products for sale to our customers from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities and our joint ventures. in recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements. we make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technologies that are implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and through our joint ventures. these investments enable our production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs. we generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technologies, such as our leading-edge line-width process technology. we continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/ write reliability and increased memory density. to leverage our significant investments in r&amp;d, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners. in addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties. we continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. 1 on july 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of elpida, now known as mmj, and a controlling interest in rexchip, now known as mmt (together, the "mmj acquisition"). the mmj acquisition included a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima, japan, a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility in taichung city, taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita, japan. these wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30% of our total wafer capacity for 2014. the operations from the mmj acquisition, which are included primarily in our mbu and cnbu segments, include the manufacture of mobile dram targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing dram targeted to desktop pcs, servers, notebooks and workstations. in connection with the mmj acquisition, we recorded net assets of $2.60 billion, noncontrolling interests of $168 million and a gain on the transaction of $1.48 billion in 2013. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements micron memory japan, inc." note.) the mmj companies are currently subject to corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan. because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the mmj acquisition, these proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees appointed by the japan court (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the reorganization proceedings. as a result of this oversight and related consent rights of the japan court and the legal trustee, our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions. for more information, see "item 3. legal proceedings reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies" and "item 1a. risk factors." business segments in the third quarter of 2014, we reorganized our business units. all prior period amounts reflect this reorganization. factors used to identify our segments include, among others, markets, customers and products. segment information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision makers. we have the following four business units, which are our reportable segments: compute and networking business

through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer. hmc enables ultra-high system performance with significantly lower power-per-bit. nand flash memory nand flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand flash sales were 27%, 40% and 44% of our total net sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. nand flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories. embedded nand flash-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, ssds, tablets, computers, industrial and automotive applications, networking and other personal and consumer applications. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash memory cards, are used with applications such as pcs, digital still cameras and mobile phones. the market for nand flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to demand for these and other embedded and removable storage devices. nand flash products are sold by sbu, ebu, mbu and cnbu. our nand flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we offer high-speed slc, mlc and tlc nand flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces. mlc and tlc products have two

applications and incorporate our extended performance and enhanced reliability technology (xpert) architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements. the end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency. we offer enterprise ssds with capacities up to 1.4 terabytes. we expect that demand for both client and enterprise ssds will continue to increase significantly over the next several years. we also offer managed nand multi-chip package ("mcp") products, which incorporate our nand flash. our managed nand products include e-mmc, e-mcp and embedded usb. our e-mmc products combine nand flash with a logic controller that performs media management and error code correction ("ecc"), which provides reduced ecc complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration and lower overall system costs. our e-mcp products combine e-mmc with lpdram on the same substrate, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design. through our lexar brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and oem channels. our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and jumpdrive products with a range of speeds, capacities and value-added features. we offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including compactflash, memory stick and secure digital ("sd"). compactflash and memory stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. other products, including sd memory cards and some jumpdrive products, incorporate third party controllers. we also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other nand flash suppliers. 3 nor flash memory nor flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off, offer fast read times due to random access capability and have execute-in-place ("xip") capability that enables processors to read nor flash without first accessing ram. these capabilities make nor ideal for storing program code in wireless and embedded applications. our nor flash sales were 3%, 9% and 12% of our total net sales for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. nor flash products are sold primarily by ebu and cnbu. we offer both parallel and serial interface nor flash products in a broad range of densities, packages and features.

partnering arrangements the following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of august 28, 2014 : entity member or partner micron ownership interest formed/ acquired product market consolidated entities: imft (1) intel corporation 51% 2006 nand flash mp mask (2) photronics, inc. 50% 2006 photomasks equity method investments: inotera (3) nanya technology corporation 33% 2009 dram tera probe (4) various 40% 2013 wafer probe (1) imft: we partner with intel for the design, development and manufacture of nand flash and certain emerging memory products. in connection therewith, we formed a joint venture with intel, imft, to manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive use of the members. the members share the output of imft generally in proportion to their investment. we sell nand flash products to intel through imft at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. we generally share product design and other research and development costs for nand flash and certain emerging memory technologies equally with intel. the imft joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights with an intel put right, commencing in january 2015, and our call right commencing in january 2018, pursuant to which intel may elect to sell to us, or we may elect to purchase from intel, intel's interest in imft. if intel elects to sell to us, we would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing of the purchase price from intel for one to two years from the closing date. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries imft" note.) (2) mp mask: we produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask, a joint venture with photronics. the mp mask joint venture agreement allows either party to terminate the joint venture in either may 2016, provided notice is given prior to may 2015, or in each five-year successive period following may 2016, provided such notice is given at least twelve months prior to the end of the successive five-year period. we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries mp mask" note.) 4 (3) inotera: we partner with nanya for the manufacture of dram products. in connection therewith, we have partnered with nanya in inotera, a dram memory company in taiwan. through december 2012, we purchased 50% of inotera's wafer production capacity based on a margin-sharing formula among nanya, inotera and us. since january 2013, we have purchased substantially all of inotera's dram output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement (the "inotera supply agreement"). the inotera supply agreement has a three-year term (currently through december 2016) that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions. if the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. in the event of a wind-down, our share of inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments inotera" note.) (4) tera probe: we have an approximate 40% ownership interest in tera probe, an entity that provides semiconductor probe and wafer testing services to us and others. manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, japan, malaysia, puerto rico, singapore and taiwan. our inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan. nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment. dram, nand flash and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. in 2014, we transitioned one of our singapore wafer fabrication facilities from production of dram to nand flash. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. we continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products. in 2014, the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 30nm line-width process technology. we expect that in 2015 that the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on our 25nm and 20nm line-width process technologies. in 2014, a majority of our nand flash memory production was manufactured on 20nm line-width process technology. we expect that in 2015 a majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured on our 16nm line-width process technology. we expect to begin sampling 3d nand flash products in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 and to begin volume production in the second half of calendar 2015. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms. our packaged products include memory modules, ssds, mcps, managed nand, memory cards and usb devices. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices. 5 in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. availability of raw materials our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. marketing and customers our products are sold into compute and graphics, mobile, ssd and other storage, automotive, industrial, medical and other embedded and server markets. market concentrations from 2014 net sales were approximately as follows: 30% for compute and graphics (including desktop pcs, notebooks and workstations); 20% for mobile; 20% for ssd and other storage; 10% for automotive, industrial, medical and other embedded; and 10% for server. sales to kingston, primarily dram, were 10% of our net sales in 2014 . sales to intel, primarily nand flash products through im flash, were 8% of our net sales in 2014 , 10% of our net sales in 2013 and 12% of our net sales in 2012 . sales to hp, primarily dram, were 9% of our net sales in 2014 , 10% of our net sales in 2013 and 8% of our net sales in 2012 . our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron, lexar , crucial , spectek and elpida brand names and private labels. we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell lexar-branded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. 6 product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size and form factors. for our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricing. research and development our process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies, as well as new, fundamentally different memory structures, materials and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory (including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies), nor flash memory, specialty memory, ssds , hmcs and other memory technologies and systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $1.37 billion, $931 million and $918 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. we share certain r&amp;d process technology and design costs for nand flash and emerging technologies with intel. we shared r&amp;d process and design costs for dram with nanya through december 2012, when our cost-sharing agreement was terminated. as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya cost-sharing arrangements, our overall r&amp;d expenses were reduced by $137 million, $146 million and $225 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. our process, design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest r&amp;d centers located in boise, idaho; hiroshima, japan; hashimoto, japan; and milpitas, california. we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world. in addition, we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. 7 geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $13.81 billion for 2014 and included sales of $6.72 billion in china, $2.31 billion in taiwan, $1.25 billion in japan, $1.25 billion in europe and $1.79 billion in the rest of the asia pacific region (excluding china, japan and taiwan). sales to customers outside the united states totaled $7.56 billion for 2013 and $6.97 billion for 2012. as of august 28, 2014, we had net property, plant and equipment of $3.28 billion in the united states, $3.10 billion in singapore, $1.22 billion in japan, $761 million in taiwan, $242 million in china, and $75 million in other countries. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information" note and "item 1a. risk factors.") patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of august 28, 2014 , we owned approximately 16,500 u.s. patents and 4,000 foreign patents. in addition, we have thousands of u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2033. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. employees as of august 28, 2014, we had approximately 30,400 employees. environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. in 2014, our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification. to continue certification, we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our executive officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal. as of august 28, 2014 , the following executive officers and directors were

officers. 10 item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. dram trade nand flash* (percentage change in average selling prices) 2014 from 2013 6% (23)% 2013 from 2012 (11)% (18)% 2012 from 2011 (45)% (55)% 2011 from 2010 (39)% (12)% * trade nand flash excludes sales to intel from imft. we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulty in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products. the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc. and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, may be considering providing, or have provided, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 11 our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks. we have a supply agreement with inotera (the "inotera supply agreement") under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of inotera's dram output over an initial three-year term at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components, currently through december 2016. the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive one-year extensions, and if the parties do not agree to an extension, the agreement will terminate following the end of the then-existing term plus a subsequent three-year wind-down period. in the event of a wind-down, our share of inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement. there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous additional risks including the following: higher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreement as compared to our wholly-owned facilities; difficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera; difficulties in transferring technology to inotera; and difficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions, such as capital expenditures or capital structure. for 2014, we purchased $2.68 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 38% of our aggregate dram gigabit production. if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. we are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation, any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness. in recent periods, our debt levels have increased. as of august 28, 2014 , we had debt with a carrying value of $6.59 billion. in addition, the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of august 28, 2014 was $2.99 billion. in 2014, we paid $2.30 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $1.09 billion. in the first quarter of 2015, we paid $389 million to settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $114 million as of august 28, 2014 . as of august 28, 2014 , we had two credit facilities available that provide for up to $408 million of additional financing, subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions. events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities. we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments, including debt incurred in connection with asset-backed financing. our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development expenditures and other business activities; continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, research and development and other general corporate requirements; contribute to a future downgrade of our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 12 we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d and product and process technology. we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion. in addition, as a result of the mmj acquisition, we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the transaction. as of august 28, 2014 , we had cash and equivalents of $4.15 billion, short-term investments of $384 million and long-term marketable investments of $819 million. cash and investments included $1.60 billion held by mmj and its consolidated subsidiaries and $84 million held by imft, none of which is generally available to finance our other operations. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan (the "japan proceedings"), for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans and advances. the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies' installment payments. these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court. as a result, the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the mmj companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the mmj companies, including investments in certain capital expenditures in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our current debt levels, expected debt amortization and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings, filed suit against mti and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in inotera, and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. 13 following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments: (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron technology for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are cancelled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. we have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court. a hearing on the matter is scheduled for february 2, 2015. we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. as of august 28, 2014, the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of $505 million and a market value of $2.06 billion. our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies. our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram, nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies . there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development, including system-level memory products, over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. 14 products that fail to meet specifications, are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace products; we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. (see "item 1. legal proceedings.") we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks. we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these relationships include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel, our inotera dram joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing or nature of further investments in our joint venture; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; we may recognize losses from our equity method investments in future periods; due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment by our joint ventures, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements; we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners; the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 15 the operations of the mmj companies will be subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings. because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj, the japan proceedings are continuing, and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the japan proceedings. the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition. during the pendency of the japan proceedings, the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies. accordingly, during the pendency of the japan proceedings, our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies. if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the u.s., singapore, taiwan, japan and china. additionally, our control over operations at our imft, inotera, mp mask and tera probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, equipment failures, earthquakes or other environmental acts. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may incur additional restructure or other charges in future periods. in recent periods, we have implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods. as a result, we could incur restructure charges (including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits, losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other long-lived assets and inventory write downs), lose production output, lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products. in connection with these actions, we recorded charges of $40 million for 2014 and $126 million for 2013. we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these prior restructure activities. we may incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods. 16 changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, the singapore dollar, the new taiwan dollar, the yen and the yuan. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $28 million for 2014 and $229 million for 2013. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $7 million as of august 28, 2014 . in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. in the event that the exchange rates for u.s. dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures in the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, the yen and the yuan, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following: integrating the operations, technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities; diverting management's attention from normal daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in recent years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram, nand flash and nor flash products. resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida (now known as mmj). these types of proceedings often lead to court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets. we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 17 the limited availability of raw materials, supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third party services, that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers, controllers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including among others, singapore, where we currently have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world. our u.s. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2010 through 2014. in addition, tax returns open to examination in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2005 to 2014. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets. we have substantial deferred tax assets, which include, among others, net operating loss and credit carryforwards. as of august 28, 2014 , our u.s. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, including uncertain tax benefits, were $3.89 billion and $1.71 billion , respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2033. as of august 28, 2014 , our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $5.37 billion, including $3.95 billion pertaining to japan, which, if not utilized, substantially all will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2023. as of august 28, 2014 , we had valuation allowances of $1.29 billion and $979 million against our net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and japan, respectively. a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, solid-state drives and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 18 our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster, fire, explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84% of our consolidated net sales for 2014. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in taiwan, singapore and japan. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export control laws and similar rules and regulations; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels; disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. breaches of our network security could expose us to losses. we manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. we also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped-call contracts on our stock and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. 19 compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") and its implementing sec regulations. the dodd-frank act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. substantially all of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of august 28, 2014 and august 29, 2013, a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our convertible notes and other notes by approximately $250 million and $147 million, respectively. the increase in interest expense caused by a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would not be significant. as of august 28, 2014 and august 29, 2013, we held debt securities of $1,653 million and $787 million, respectively, that were subject to interest rate risk. we estimate that a 0.5% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately $6 million as of august 28, 2014 and $4 million as of august 29, 2013. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in "item 1a. risk factors." changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. as a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and carry certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, the shekel, the singapore dollar, the new taiwan dollar, the yen and the yuan. we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates. we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs. our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $7 million as of august 28, 2014 and $19 million as of august 29, 2013 . to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature within 12 to 18 months. as of august 28, 2018, under the terms and conditions of the mmj companies' plans of reorganization, we are obligated to pay 142 billion yen (or the equivalent of $1.37 billion based on exchange rates as of august 28, 2014) to the external creditors of the mmj companies. the installment payments are due at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 through 2019. to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on the payments due in 2014 and 2015, we entered into forward contracts to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28, 2014 and 10 billion yen on november 27, 2015. in addition, the mmj companies' cash and equivalent balances in yen mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the remaining installment payments due in 2015 and after. (see "item 8 financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements debt mmj creditor installment payments.") 45risk factors." all period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. corporate information micron, a delaware corporation, was incorporated in 1978. our executive offices are located at 8000 south federal way, boise, idaho 83716-9632 and our telephone number is (208) 368-4000. information about us is available on the internet at www.micron.com. copies of our annual report on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, and current reports on form 8-k, as well as any amendments to these reports, are available through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec. materials filed or furnished by us with the sec are also available at the sec's public reference room at 100 f street, ne, washington, d.c. 20549. information on the operation of the public reference room is available by calling (800) sec-0330. also available on our website are our: corporate governance guidelines, governance committee charter, compensation committee charter, audit committee charter, and code of business conduct and ethics. any amendments or waivers of our code of business conduct and ethics will also be posted on our website at www.micron.com within four business days of the amendment or waiver. copies of these documents are available to shareholders upon request. information contained or referenced on our website is not incorporated by reference and does not form a part of this annual report on form 10-k. overview micron technology, inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries, is a global leader in advanced semiconductor systems. our broad portfolio of high-performance memory technologies, including dram, nand flash, and nor flash, is the basis for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages, and other system solutions. our memory solutions enable the world's most innovative computing, consumer, enterprise storage, networking, mobile, embedded, and automotive applications. we market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives, and distributors primarily to oems and retailers located around the world. our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced product and process technologies, and generating a return on r&amp;d investments. we obtain products for sale to our customers from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities and our joint ventures. in recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements. we make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technologies that are implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and through our joint ventures. these investments enable our production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs. we generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technologies, such as our leading-edge line-width process technology. we continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. to leverage our significant investments in r&amp;d, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners. in addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties. we continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. 1 on july 31, 2013, we completed the acquisition of elpida, now known as mmj, and a controlling interest in rexchip, now known as mmt (together, the "mmj acquisition"). the mmj acquisition included a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima, japan, a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility in taichung city, taiwan, and an assembly and test facility located in akita, japan. these wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30% of our total wafer capacity for 2015. the operations from the mmj acquisition, which are included primarily in our mbu and cnbu segments, include the manufacture of mobile dram targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing dram targeted to desktop pcs, servers, notebooks, and workstations. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements micron memory japan, inc.") business segments we have the following four business units, which are our reportable segments: compute and networking business unit ("cnbu"): includes memory products sold into compute, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets. mobile business unit ("mbu"): includes memory products sold into smartphone, tablet, and other mobile-device markets. storage business unit ("sbu"): includes memory products sold into enterprise, client, cloud, and removable storage markets. sbu also includes products sold to intel through our imft joint venture. embedded business unit ("ebu"): includes memory products sold into automotive, industrial, connected

information." products dram dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval with a variety of performance, pricing, and other characteristics. sales of dram products were 64%, 68%, and 48% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. dram products are sold by cnbu, mbu, and ebu. ddr3 dram is a standardized, high-density, high-volume, dram product, which offers high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost. ddr3 products are primarily targeted at computers, servers, networking devices, communications equipment, consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications. in 2015, we offered ddr3 products in 1gb, 2gb, 4gb, and 8gb densities. we also offered next generation ddr4 dram products in 4gb and 8gb densities in 2015 and we expect sales of these products to increase significantly in 2016 as they replace ddr3 dram products in many applications. sales of ddr3 and ddr4 dram products were 38%, 40%, and 31% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. lpdram products offer lower power consumption relative to other dram products and are used primarily in mobile phones, tablets, embedded applications, ultra-thin laptop computers, and other mobile consumer devices that require low power consumption. we offer ddr4, ddr3, ddr2, and ddr versions of lpdram. sales of lpdram products were 18%, 20%, and 6% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we also offer other dram products targeted to specialty markets including ddr2 dram, ddr dram, gddr5 dram, sdram, rldram, and psram. these products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, computer peripherals, automotive and industrial applications, and computer memory upgrades. we offer hmc products, which are semiconductor memory devices where vertical stacks of dram die that are connected using through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer. hmc enables ultra-high system performance and is targeted primarily at networking and high performance computing applications. 2 non-volatile memory non-volatile memory includes nand flash and 3d xpoint memory. through 2015, substantially all of our non-volatile memory sales were from nand flash products. nand flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand flash sales were 33%, 27%, and 40% of our total net sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. nand flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories. embedded nand flash-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, ssds, tablets, computers, industrial and automotive applications, networking, and other personal and consumer applications. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash memory cards, are used with applications such as pcs, digital still cameras, and mobile phones. the market for nand flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to increased demand for these and other embedded and removable storage devices. nand flash products are sold by sbu, ebu, mbu, and cnbu. our nand flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we offer high-speed slc, mlc, and tlc nand flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces. mlc and tlc products have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of slc products. in 2015, we offered slc nand flash products in 1gb to 64gb densities; 2-bit-per-cell mlc nand flash products in 8gb to 128gb densities; and 3-bit-per-cell tlc nand flash in 128gb density. in 2015, we began sampling products featuring our new 3d nand flash technology, which stacks layers of data storage cells vertically to create storage devices with three times higher capacity than competing nand flash technologies. this enables more storage in a smaller space, bringing significant cost savings, low power usage and high performance to a range of mobile consumer devices as well as the most demanding enterprise deployments. we expect to be in production of a 256gb mlc version and 384gb tlc version of 3d nand flash products by the end of calendar year 2015. we offer client and enterprise ssds which feature higher performance, reduced-power consumption, and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. our client ssds are targeted at notebooks, desktops, workstations, and other consumer applications. using our nand flash process technology and a leading-edge sata 6 gb per second interface, our ssds deliver read and write speeds that help improve boot and application load times and deliver higher performance than hard disk drives. our client ssds feature industry-leading encryption for corporate users and are offered in a 2.5-inch, m.2., and msata modules, with densities up to 1 terabyte. our enterprise ssds are targeted at server and storage applications and incorporate our extended performance and enhanced reliability technology ("xpert") architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements. the end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection, and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency. we offer enterprise ssds with both pcie and sata interfaces and capacities up to 1.4 terabytes. we expect that demand for both client and enterprise ssds will continue to increase significantly over the next several years. we also offer managed mcp products, which incorporate our nand flash. these managed nand flash products include e-mmc, e-mcp, and embedded usb. our e-mmc products combine nand flash with a logic controller that performs media management and error code correction ("ecc"), which provides reduced ecc complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration, and lower overall system costs. our e-mcp products combine e-mmc with lpdram on the same substrate, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design. through our lexar brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and oem channels. our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and jumpdrive products with a range of speeds, capacities, and value-added features. we offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including compactflash , memory stick , and secure digital ("sd") formats. compactflash and memory stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. other products, including sd memory cards and some jumpdrive products, incorporate third party controllers. we also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other nand flash suppliers. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we introduced 3d xpoint technology, a new category of non-volatile memory. 3d xpoint memory's innovative, transistor-less, cross point architecture creates a three-dimensional checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. as a result, data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to fast and efficient read/write processes. we plan to produce commercial volumes of 3d xpoint memory products in 2016. 3 other other products included primarily nor flash, which are electrically re-writeable, semiconductor memory devices that offer fast read times which are used in wireless and embedded applications. partnering arrangements the following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of september 3, 2015 : entity member or partner micron ownership interest formed/ acquired product market consolidated entities: imft (1) intel corporation 51% 2006 non-volatile mp mask (2) photronics, inc. 50% 2006 photomasks equity method investments: inotera (3) nanya technology corporation 33% 2009 dram tera probe (4) various 40% 2013 wafer probe (1) imft: we partner with intel for the design, development, and manufacture of nand flash and 3d xpoint memory products. in connection therewith, we formed the imft joint venture with intel to manufacture nand flash and 3d xpoint memory products for the exclusive use of the members. the members share the output of imft generally in proportion to their investment. we sell a portion of our products to intel through imft at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory. the imft joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights. commencing in january 2015, intel can put to us, and commencing in january 2018, we can call from intel, intel's interest in imft, in either case, for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to intel at that time. if intel elects to sell to us, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from intel for one to two years from the closing date. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries imft.") (2) mp mask: we produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next-generation semiconductors through mp mask, a joint venture with photronics. on march 24, 2015, we notified photronics of our election to terminate mp mask effective in may 2016. upon termination, we have the right to acquire photronics' interest in mp mask for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance. since its inception, we and photronics have each owned approximately 50% of mp mask. we purchase a substantial majority of the photomasks produced by mp mask pursuant to a supply arrangement. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries mp mask.") (3) inotera: we partner with nanya for the manufacture of dram products by inotera, a taiwan dram memory company. since january 2013, we have purchased all of inotera's dram output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement. in the second quarter of 2015, we executed a supply agreement, to be effective beginning on january 1, 2016 (the "2016 supply agreement"), which will replace the current agreement. under the 2016 supply agreement, the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us. the 2016 supply agreement has an initial two-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions. upon termination of the initial two-year term of the 2016 supply agreement, or any extensions, we would purchase dram from inotera during the wind-down period. our share of inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments inotera.") (4) tera probe: we have an approximate 40% ownership interest in tera probe, an entity that provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others. 4 manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, japan, malaysia, singapore, and taiwan. our inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan. nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment. dram, nand flash, and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. in 2015, we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memory. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. we continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes, and transitioning to higher density products. in 2015, the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 25nm line-width process technologies. we expect that by the second half of 2016 the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on our 20nm line-width process technology. in 2015, a majority of our nand flash production was manufactured on our 20nm and 16nm line-width process technology. we began production of 3d nand flash products in 2015 and expect that in 2016 the majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured using 16nm line-width process technology or 3d nand technology. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and dust particles. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products, and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data, and reducing testing time and cost. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms. our packaged products include memory modules, ssds, mcps, managed nand, memory cards, usb devices, and hmcs. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. 5 availability of raw materials our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. marketing and customers our products are sold into compute and graphics, mobile, ssd and other storage, automotive, industrial, medical, and other embedded and server markets. market concentrations from 2015 net sales were approximately as follows: 25% for compute and graphics (including desktop pcs, notebooks, and workstations); 25% for mobile; 20% for ssd and other storage; 15% for server; and 10% for automotive, industrial, medical, and other embedded. sales to kingston, primarily dram, were 11% of our net sales in 2015 and 10% of our net sales in 2014 . sales to intel, primarily nand flash products through imft were 8% of our net sales in 2015 , 8% of our net sales in 2014 , and 10% of our net sales in 2013 . sales to hp, primarily dram, were 7% of our net sales in 2015 , 9% of our net sales in 2014 , and 10% of our net sales in 2013 . our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron , lexar, crucial , spectek , and elpida brand names and private labels. we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell lexar-branded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. under our general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions. 6 competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc.; and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology, and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors. for our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing. research and development our process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies, as well as new, fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory (including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies), 3d xpoint memory, nor flash memory, specialty memory, ssds , hmcs, and other memory technologies and systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $1.54 billion , $1.37 billion, and $931 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory. our r&amp;d expenses reflect net reductions of $231 million, $162 million, and $176 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our intel and other cost-sharing arrangements. to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest r&amp;d center located in boise, idaho, and other significant r&amp;d centers in japan, china, and other sites in the u.s. in addition, we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $13.63 billion for 2015 and included sales of $6.66 billion in china, $2.24 billion in taiwan, $1.25 billion in europe, $1.03 billion in japan, and $2.04 billion in the rest of the asia pacific region (excluding china, japan, and taiwan). sales to customers outside the united states totaled $13.81 billion for 2014 and $7.56 billion for 2013. as of september 3, 2015, we had net property, plant, and equipment of $3.64 billion in the united states, $3.24 billion in singapore, $2.17 billion in japan, $1.07 billion in taiwan, $331 million in china, and $96 million in other countries. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information" and "item 1a. risk factors.") 7 patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of september 3, 2015 , we owned approximately 16,800 u.s. patents and 4,200 foreign patents. in addition, we have thousands of u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2034. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. employees as of september 3, 2015 , we had approximately 31,800 employees. environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions, and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. in 2015, our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification. to continue certification, we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping, and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our executive officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until

are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. dram trade nand flash* (percentage change in average selling prices) 2015 from 2014 (11 )% (17 )% 2014 from 2013 6 % (23 )% 2013 from 2012 (11 )% (18 )% 2012 from 2011 (45 )% (55 )% 2011 from 2010 (39 )% (12 )% * trade nand flash excludes sales to intel from imft. we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulty in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers, and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products. the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; sk hynix inc.; and toshiba corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs. transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. in recent periods, we and some of our competitors have begun construction on or announced plans to build new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 11 debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. in recent periods, our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. as of september 3, 2015 , we had debt with a carrying value of $7.34 billion . in addition, the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of september 3, 2015 was $553 million . in 2015, we paid $1.43 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $489 million. in 2014, we paid $2.30 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of $1.09 billion. as of september 3, 2015 , we had (1) revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to $842 million of additional financing and (2) a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property, plant, and equipment in the amount of 6.90 billion new taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in u.s. dollars (approximately $213 million as of september 3, 2015 ), of which we drew $40 million in 2015. the availability of these revolving and other facilities is subject to certain conditions, including outstanding balances of trade receivables; inventories; collateralization of certain property, plant, and equipment; and other conditions. events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize these facilities. we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, r&amp;d, and other general corporate requirements; adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d, and product and process technology. we estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $5.3 billion to $5.8 billion. investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were $4.12 billion. in addition, as a result of the mmj acquisition and our capacity expansion in singapore, we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels. as of september 3, 2015 , we had cash and marketable investments of $5.63 billion , which included $748 million held by the mmj group and $134 million held by imft, none of which is generally available to finance our other operations. 12 as a result of the japan proceedings, for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances. the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies' installment payments. these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court. as a result, the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the mmj companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures, and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the mmj group, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings, filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in inotera as of september 3, 2015 , and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments: (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. we have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court. the next hearing on the matter has not yet been scheduled. we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, or financial condition. as of september 3, 2015 , the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of $683 million and a market value of $846 million. 13 our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies. our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram, nand flash, and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements, and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies . there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. in the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology, which is an entirely new class of non-volatile memory. there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful. if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products, including system-level memory products, that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, nor flash, and certain specialty memory products, requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance of the following: that our product development efforts will be successful; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these products; or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. if our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product or replace products; we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. 14 a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property, could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii. financial information item 8. financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies.") we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks. we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel, our inotera joint venture with nanya, and our mp mask joint venture with photronics. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in our joint venture; our joint venture partners' products may compete with our products; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; we may recognize losses from our equity method investments; due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our partners may decide not to join us in funding capital investment in our joint ventures, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements; we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners; the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the u.s., singapore, taiwan, japan, malaysia, and china. additionally, our control over operations at imft, inotera, mp mask, and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, equipment failures, earthquakes, or other environmental events. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenues, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 15 the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings. because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj, the japan proceedings are continuing, and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the japan proceedings. the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition. during the pendency of the japan proceedings, the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes, or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies. accordingly, during the pendency of the japan proceedings, our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies. our inotera supply agreements involves numerous risks. since january 2013, we have purchased all of inotera's dram output at a price reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement. in the second quarter of 2015, we executed a supply agreement, to be effective beginning on january 1, 2016 (the "2016 supply agreement"), which will replace the current agreement. under the 2016 supply agreement, the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us. the 2016 supply agreement has an initial two-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period, and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a two-year extension, and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive one-year extensions. upon termination of the initial two-year term of the 2016 supply agreement, or any extensions, we would purchase dram from inotera during the wind-down period. our share of inotera's capacity would decline over the wind-down period. our inotera supply agreements involve numerous risks including the following: higher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreements as compared to our wholly-owned facilities; difficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera; difficulties in transferring technology to inotera; and difficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions, such as capital expenditures or capital structure. in 2015 and in 2014, our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities, due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions. for 2015, we purchased $2.37 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 35% of our aggregate dram gigabit production. if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 16 changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. across our global operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the british pound, euro, shekel, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, yen, and yuan. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $27 million for 2015, $28 million for 2014, and $229 million for 2013. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $3 million as of september 3, 2015 . in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. in the event that exchange rates for the u.s. dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following: integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; diverting management's attention from daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in previous years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram, nand flash, and nor flash products. resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida (now known as mmj). these types of proceedings often lead to court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets. we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. breaches of our network security could expose us to losses. we manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. we also process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. unauthorized users may be able to gain access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers, and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised. 17 compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations. the dodd-frank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free. we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we operate in a number of locations outside the u.s., including in singapore, and, to a lesser extent, taiwan, where we have tax incentive agreements that are, in part, conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, and changes in tax laws and regulations. we file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world. our u.s. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2011 through 2015. in addition, tax returns open to examination in multiple other taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2007 to 2015. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets. we have substantial deferred tax assets, which include, among others, net operating loss and credit carryforwards. as of september 3, 2015 , our u.s. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, including uncertain tax benefits, were $4.02 billion and $2.05 billion , respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035. as of september 3, 2015 , our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $5.15 billion, including $3.81 billion pertaining to japan, which, if not utilized, substantially all will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2025. as of september 3, 2015 , we had valuation allowances of $1.16 billion and $710 million against our net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and japan, respectively. the limited availability of raw materials, supplies, or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third party services, that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers, controllers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 18 our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, solid-state drives, and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84% of our consolidated net sales for 2015. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore, taiwan, and japan. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; protection of intellectual property; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels; disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 19 we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped-call contracts on our stock, and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. substantially all of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of september 3, 2015 and august 28, 2014, a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our notes payable by approximately $366 million and $250 million, respectively. the increase in interest expense caused by a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would not be significant. as of september 3, 2015 and august 24, 2014, we held debt securities of $3.83 billion and $1.65 billion, respectively, that were subject to interest rate risk. we estimate that a 0.5% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately $13 million as of september 3, 2015 and $6 million as of august 28, 2014. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in "part i item 1a. risk factors." changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. 40 the functional currency for all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the u.s. dollar. the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the british pound, the euro, the shekel, the singapore dollar, the new taiwan dollar, the yen, and the yuan. we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, we utilize a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days. based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities, offset by balance sheet hedges, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $3 million as of september 3, 2015 and $7 million as of august 28, 2014 . to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months. 41risk factors." all period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. overview micron technology, inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries, is a global leader in advanced semiconductor systems. our broad portfolio of high-performance memory technologies, including dram, nand flash, and nor flash, is the basis for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages, and other system solutions. our memory solutions enable the world's most innovative computing, consumer, enterprise storage, networking, mobile, embedded, and automotive applications. we market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives, and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market and in order to remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new technologies and decrease manufacturing costs. our success is largely dependent on market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced product and process technologies, and generating a return on r&amp;d investments. we obtain products for sale to our customers from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities and our joint ventures. in recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements. we make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technologies that are implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and joint ventures. we generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technologies, such as our leading-edge line-width process technology. we continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. to leverage our significant investments in r&amp;d, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners. in addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties. we continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. proposed acquisition of inotera in the second quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash (equivalent to approximately $0.95 per share, assuming 31.7 new taiwan dollars per u.s. dollar, the exchange rate as of september 1, 2016). as of september 1, 2016, we held a 33% ownership interest in inotera, nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32% ownership interest, and the remaining ownership interest in inotera was publicly held. based on the exchange rate as of september 1, 2016, we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67% of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately $4.1 billion . on march 29, 2016, the transaction was approved by the shareholders of inotera, including nanya and certain of nanya's affiliates (which approval was provided pursuant to voting and support agreements). under the voting and support agreements, the parties have further agreed not to transfer any of their inotera shares so long as the voting and support agreements are in effect. these agreements will terminate automatically upon the termination of the agreement to purchase the inotera shares. on october 11, 2016, the inotera board set the date for the closing of the transaction to be december 6, 2016. there can be no assurance that the inotera transaction will be consummated, which is subject to certain termination rights and various conditions, including but not limited to: 1 the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals from authorities in taiwan, which have been received; the consummation and funding of the term loan facility (described below); and unless we determine otherwise, the consummation and funding of the private placement (described below). acquisition financing : on october 11, 2016, we and inotera, as co-borrowers, entered into a single-draw term loan facility (the "term loan facility"), from which proceeds will be used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration and any related transaction costs and to provide working capital for inotera. in the second and third quarters of 2016, we entered into agreements with nanya pursuant to which we have the option to issue a combination of shares of our common stock (the "micron shares") and 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 convertible notes") to nanya, which is subject to regulatory approvals and various other conditions. term loan facility : the term loan facility can be made in a single draw on or prior to july 10, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, up to a maximum aggregate borrowing amount of 80 billion new taiwan dollars in cash (equivalent to $2.5 billion). the loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month or six-month taibor, at our or inotera's option, plus a margin of 2.05% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. the loan will mature five years from the date it is made and principal is payable in six equal semi-annual installments, commencing thirty months after such loan is made. the term loan facility will be collateralized by certain assets including a real estate mortgage on inotera's main production facility and site, a chattel mortgage over certain equipment of inotera, all of the stock of our mstw subsidiary and the approximately 80% of the stock of inotera held by mstw following the consummation of the acquisition. micron will guarantee all of inotera's and mstw's obligations under the term loan facility. the term loan facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which are customary for financings of this type, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability to create liens in or dispose of collateral securing obligations under the term loan facility, mergers involving mstw and/or inotera, loans or guarantees to third parties by inotera and/or mstw, and mstw's distribution of cash dividends (subject to satisfaction of certain financial conditions). the term loan facility also contains financial covenants as follows, which are tested semi-annually: mstw must maintain a consolidated ratio of total debt to ebitda not higher than 5.50x in 2017 and 2018; and not higher than 4.50x through 2019 to 2021. mstw must maintain consolidated tangible net worth of not less than 4 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $126 million) in 2017 and 2018; not less than 6.5 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $205 million) in 2019 and 2020; and not less than 12 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $378 million) in 2021. on a consolidated basis, we must maintain a ratio of total debt to ebitda not higher than 3.50x in 2017; not higher than 3.00x in 2018 and 2019; and not higher than 2.50x in 2020 and 2021. on a consolidated basis, we must maintain tangible net worth not less than $9 billion in 2017; not less than $12.5 billion in 2018 and 2019; and not less than $16.5 billion in 2020 and 2021. if one or more of the required financial ratios is not maintained at the time the ratios are tested, the interest rate will be increased by 0.25% until such time as the required financial ratios are maintained. in addition, if mstw fails to maintain a required financial ratio for two consecutive semi-annual periods, such failure will constitute an event of default that could result in all obligations owed under the term loan agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable. our failure to maintain a required consolidated financial ratio will only result in an increase to the applicable interest rate and will not constitute an event of default under the term loan facility. the term loan facility also contains customary events of default. micron shares : we have the option to issue micron shares in an amount up to 31.5 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $991 million ) (the "private placement"), which would be used to fund a portion of the acquisition consideration. the per-share selling price for the micron shares would be equal to the greater of the new taiwan dollar equivalent of (i) the average of the closing sale price of our common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the 30 th calendar day prior to the consummation of the inotera acquisition or (ii) $10.00 . 2021 convertible notes : we have the option to issue 12.6 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $396 million ) in 2021 convertible notes in lieu of a corresponding value of micron shares so long as we also issue micron shares to nanya of at least 6.3 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $198 million ) pursuant to the private placement. 2 technology transfer and license agreements with nanya : in the second quarter of 2016, we entered into technology transfer and license agreements pursuant to which nanya has the option to require us to transfer to nanya certain technology and deliverables related to the next dram process node generation (the "1x process node") after our 20nm process node and the next dram process node generation after the 1x process node for nanya's use. under the terms of the agreements, nanya would pay royalties to us for a license to the transferred technology based on revenues from products utilizing the technology, subject to an agreed cap, and we would also receive an equity interest in nanya upon the achievement of certain milestones. nanya's option becomes exercisable upon the closing of the inotera acquisition transaction. business segments we have the following four business units, which are our reportable segments: compute and networking business unit ("cnbu") : includes memory products sold into compute, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets. storage business unit ("sbu") : includes memory products sold into enterprise, client, cloud, and removable storage markets. sbu also includes products sold to intel through our imft joint venture. mobile business unit ("mbu") : includes memory products sold into smartphone, tablet, and other mobile-device markets. embedded business unit ("ebu") : includes memory products sold into automotive, industrial, connected home, and consumer electronics markets. for more information regarding our segments, see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements segment information." products dram dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval with a variety of performance, pricing, and other characteristics. sales of dram products were 58%, 64%, and 68% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. ddr3 and ddr4 dram are standardized, high-density, high-volume, dram products, which offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost. ddr3 and ddr4 products are primarily targeted at computers, servers, networking devices, communications equipment, consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications. in 2016, we offered ddr3 and ddr4 products in 1gb to 8gb densities. sales of ddr4 products increased significantly in 2016 and we expect further increases in 2017 as they replace ddr3 dram products in many applications. sales of ddr3 and ddr4 dram products were 31%, 38%, and 40% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. lpdram products offer lower power consumption relative to other dram products and are used primarily in smartphones, tablets, automotive applications, laptop computers, and other mobile consumer devices that require low power consumption. we offer ddr4, ddr3, ddr2, and ddr versions of lpdram. sales of lpdram products were 18%, 18%, and 20% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. we also offer other dram products targeted to specialty markets including ddr2 dram, ddr dram, gddr5 and gddr5x dram, sdram, and rldram. these products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, computer peripherals, automotive and industrial applications, and computer memory upgrades. we offer hmc products, which are semiconductor memory devices where vertical stacks of dram die that are connected using through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer. hmc enables ultra-high system performance and is targeted primarily at networking and high performance computing applications. 3 non-volatile memory non-volatile memory includes nand flash and 3d xpoint memory. through 2016, substantially all of our non-volatile memory sales were from nand flash products. nand flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand flash sales were 37%, 33%, and 27% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. nand flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories. embedded nand flash-based storage devices are utilized in smartphones, ssds, tablets, computers, automotive and industrial applications, networking, and other consumer applications. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash memory cards, are used with applications such as pcs, digital still cameras, and smartphones. the market for nand flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to increased demand for these and other embedded and removable storage devices. our nand flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we offer high-speed slc, mlc, and tlc planar nand flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces in 1gb to 128gb densities. mlc and tlc products have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of slc products. in 2016, we began selling commercial volumes of new products featuring our new 3d nand flash technology, which stacks layers of data storage cells vertically to create storage devices with three times higher capacity than competing planar nand flash technologies. this enables more storage in a smaller space, bringing significant cost savings, low power usage and high performance to a range of mobile consumer devices as well as the most demanding enterprise deployments. we are currently in production of mlc and tlc versions of 3d nand flash and we expect 3d nand to be the majority of our nand flash output beginning in the first quarter of 2017. our current 3d nand flash products feature 32 layers and we expect to offer next generation 3d nand flash products with 64 layers in 2017. we offer client and enterprise ssds which feature higher performance, reduced-power consumption, and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. our client ssds are targeted at notebooks, desktops, workstations, and other consumer applications. increasingly our ssds are being utilized in large scale cloud environments. using our 3d nand flash process technology, our ssds deliver read and write speeds that help improve boot and application load times and deliver higher performance than hard disk drives. our client ssds, including our newest line of 3d nand ssds, deliver world-class data storage, endurance, power efficiency, reliability, and performance for corporate users and are offered in a 2.5-inch, m.2, sata, and pcie nvme solutions, with densities up to 2 terabytes. our enterprise ssds are targeted at server and storage applications and incorporate our extended performance and enhanced reliability technology ("xpert") architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements. the end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection, and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency. we offer enterprise ssds with pcie nvme, sas, and sata interfaces and capacities up to 3.2 terabytes. we expect that demand for both client and enterprise ssds will continue to increase significantly over the next several years. we also offer mcp products, which incorporate our nand flash. we offer mcp products that combine nand flash with lpdram to enable small form-factor solutions that combine storage and execution memory. we also offer managed nand flash mcp products including e-mmc, e-mcp, and embedded usb. our e-mmc products combine nand flash with a logic controller that performs media management and error code correction ("ecc"), which provides reduced ecc complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration, and lower overall system costs. our e-mcp products combine e-mmc with lpdram on the same substrate, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design. mcp products are used in smartphone, automotive, industrial, and other consumer applications. through our lexar brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and original equipment manufacturer channels. our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and jumpdrive products with a range of speeds, capacities, and value-added features. we offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including compactflash , memory stick , and secure digital ("sd") formats. compactflash and memory stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. other products, including sd memory cards and some jumpdrive products, incorporate third-party controllers. we also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other nand flash suppliers. in 2015, we introduced 3d xpoint technology, a new category of non-volatile memory. 3d xpoint memory's innovative, transistor-less, cross point architecture creates a three-dimensional checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. as a result, data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to fast and efficient read/write processes. we began production of 3d xpoint memory products in 2016 and expect to significantly increase production in 2017. 4 other other products included primarily nor flash, which are electrically re-writeable, semiconductor memory devices that offer fast read times and are used in automotive, industrial, connected home, and consumer applications. partnering arrangements the following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of september 1, 2016 : entity member or partner ownership interest formed/ acquired product market consolidated entities imft (1) intel corporation 51% 2006 non-volatile equity method investments inotera (2) nanya technology corporation 33% 2009 dram tera probe (3) various 40% 2013 wafer probe (1) imft : we partner with intel for the design, development, and manufacture of nand flash and 3d xpoint memory products. in connection therewith, we formed the imft joint venture with intel to manufacture nand flash and 3d xpoint memory products exclusively for the use of the members. the members share the output of imft generally in proportion to their investment. we sell a portion of our products to intel through imft at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory. the imft joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights. commencing in january 2016, intel can put to us, and commencing in january 2019, we can call from intel, intel's interest in imft, in either case, for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to intel at that time. if intel elects to exercise its put right, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from intel for one to two years from the closing date. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries imft.") (2) inotera : we partner with nanya for the manufacture of dram products by inotera, a taiwan dram memory company. effective beginning on january 1, 2016, the price for dram products purchased by us is based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us and has an initial three-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period. upon termination of the initial three-year term, the share of inotera's capacity we would purchase would decline over the wind-down period. in 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity method investments inotera" and "proposed acquisition of inotera.") (3) tera probe : we have an approximate 40% ownership interest in tera probe, an entity that provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others. 5 manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, japan, malaysia, singapore, and taiwan. inotera has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan. nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment. dram, nand flash, 3d xpoint memory, and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. in 2015, we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memory and we began utilizing a portion of the facility for production in the second half of 2016. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. we continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes, and transitioning to higher density products. in the second half of 2016, the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 20nm line-width process technologies. we expect to ramp volume production of 1xnm process node dram in 2017. beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we expect a majority of our nand flash production to be manufactured using our first generation 3d nand technology. in 2017, we expect to ramp our second generation 64-layer 3d nand technology and we expect triple-level-cell to become the majority of our 3d nand output. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and dust particles. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products, and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data, and reducing testing time and cost. we use subcontractors to perform certain testing services. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms. our packaged products include memory modules, ssds, mcps, managed nand, memory cards, usb devices, and hmcs. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. we subcontract assembly services for the production of certain memory modules, ssds, mcps, memory cards, and usb devices. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. 6 availability of raw materials and use of service providers our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. in some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. we have made significant investments in supply chain risk monitoring and management to mitigate our risks associated with raw materials and service providers. marketing and customers market concentrations from 2016 net sales were approximately as follows: 20% for compute and graphics (including desktop pcs, notebooks, and workstations); 20% for mobile; 20% for ssd and other storage; 15% for automotive, industrial, medical, and other embedded; and 10% for server. sales to intel, including non-volatile memory through imft, were 14% of our net sales in 2016 , 8% of our net sales in 2015 , and 8% of our net sales in 2014 . sales to kingston, primarily dram, were 7% of our net sales in 2016 , 11% of our net sales in 2015 , and 10% of our net sales in 2014 . our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron , lexar, crucial , spectek , and elpida brand names and private labels. we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell lexar-branded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. 7 competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors. for our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing. research and development our process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of process technologies that enable successively smaller line-widths, additional 3d memory layers, and additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels). we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr4 and ddr5 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile 3d nand flash memory (including tlc and qlc technologies), 3d xpoint memory, ssds (including firmware and controllers), managed nand, specialty memory, nor flash memory, and other memory technologies and systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $1.62 billion , $1.54 billion , and $1.37 billion in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory. our r&amp;d expenses reflect net reductions of $208 million, $231 million, and $162 million in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements with intel and others. to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest r&amp;d center located in boise, idaho, and other significant r&amp;d centers in japan, china, italy, singapore and other sites in the u.s. in 2016, we commenced construction on an expansion of our r&amp;d facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. 8 geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $10.47 billion for 2016 and included sales of $5.30 billion in china, $1.52 billion in taiwan, $937 million in europe, $831 million in japan, and $1.61 billion in the rest of the asia pacific region (excluding china, taiwan, and japan). sales to customers outside the united states totaled $13.63 billion for 2015 and $13.81 billion for 2014 . as of september 1, 2016 , we had net property, plant, and equipment of $5.44 billion in singapore, $3.89 billion in the united states, $2.69 billion in japan, $2.08 billion in taiwan, $491 million in china, and $97 million in other countries. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information" and "item 1a. risk factors.") patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of september 1, 2016 , we owned approximately 16,100 u.s. patents and 4,300 foreign patents. in addition, we have thousands of u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2036. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. employees as of september 1, 2016 , we had approximately 31,400 employees. environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions, and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. in 2016, our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification. to continue certification, we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping, and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our executive officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation, or removal. 9 as of september 1, 2016 , the following executive officers and directors were

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from past results and those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. the order of these factors is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us. our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. the factors below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. dram trade non-volatile (percentage change in average selling prices) 2016 from 2015 (35 )% (20 )% 2015 from 2014 (11 )% (17 )% 2014 from 2013 6 % (23 )% 2013 from 2012 (11 )% (18 )% 2012 from 2011 (45 )% (55 )% we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, additional 3d memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, technological barriers, and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products. the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages. 13 debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. in recent periods, our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. as of september 1, 2016 , we had debt with a carrying value of $9.91 billion . in 2016, 2015, and 2014 we paid $94 million , $1.43 billion, $2.30 billion, respectively, to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with principal amounts of and $57 million, $489 million, and $1.09 billion, respectively. as of september 1, 2016 , we had a revolving credit facility available for up to $488 million of additional financing. the availability of this revolving facility is subject to certain conditions, including outstanding balances of eligible receivables. events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable draw-down conditions and utilize this facility. we have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. in 2016, we issued $1.25 billion of our 2023 secured notes and $750 million of our 2022 term loan b, and received an aggregate of $765 million in equipment sale-leaseback financing transactions. in connection with our proposed acquisition of the remaining interest in inotera, we plan to fund a portion of the acquisition with a loan of up to 80 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $2.5 billion) under the term loan facility and, at our option, 12.6 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $396 million) of 2021 convertible notes. the date for the closing of the inotera transaction has been set by the inotera board for december 6, 2016. consummation of the inotera transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the inotera transaction will be consummated. our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; require us and our mstw subsidiary to comply with financial covenants, which, if mstw fails to maintain could result in all obligations owing under the term loan agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable and if we or mstw fail to maintain, could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate; adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, r&amp;d, and other general corporate requirements; restrict micron's ability and that of its domestic restricted subsidiaries to create or incur certain liens and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory industry conditions; continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; and require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d, and product and process technology. we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion, which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners. investments in capital expenditures, offset by amounts funded by our partners, were $5.40 billion for 2016. as of september 1, 2016 , we had cash and marketable investments of $4.81 billion . as of september 1, 2016 , $919 million of cash and equivalents and short-term investments, including substantially all of the $896 million held by the mmj group, were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the u.s. would subject these funds to u.s. federal income taxes. in addition, cash held by imft of $98 million was generally not available to finance our other operations. 14 as a result of the japan proceedings, for so long as such proceedings are continuing, the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends, loans, and advances. the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies' installment payments. these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies, as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court. moreover, loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court. as a result, the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, while available to satisfy the mmj companies' installment payments and the other obligations, capital expenditures, and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries, are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of the mmj group, including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. our proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera involves numerous risks. in the second quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash (equivalent to approximately $0.95 per share). as of september 1, 2016 , we held a 33% ownership interest in inotera, nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32% ownership interest, and the remaining ownership interest in inotera was publicly held. based on the exchange rate as of september 1, 2016 , we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67% of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately $4.1 billion . we anticipate financing the acquisition with a combination of the following: 80 billion new taiwan dollar (equivalent to $2.5 billion ) five-year term loan facility at a variable rate equal to the three-month or six-month taibor, at our or inotera's option, plus a margin of 2.05% per annum under the term loan facility; up to 31.5 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $991 million ) from the issuance of the micron shares under the private placement; 12.6 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $396 million ) from the issuance of the 2021 convertible notes in lieu of a corresponding amount of micron shares so long as we also issue micron shares to nanya of at least 6.3 billion new taiwan dollars (equivalent to $198 million ) pursuant to the private placement; additional borrowings under our existing credit agreement; and cash on hand. on march 29, 2016, the transaction was approved by the shareholders of inotera, including nanya and certain of nanya's affiliates (which approval was provided pursuant to voting and support agreements). on october 11, 2016, the inotera board set the date for the closing of the transaction to be december 6, 2016. consummation of the inotera transaction is subject to significant uncertainties, certain termination rights, and various conditions, including regulatory approvals and the consummation of debt financing. there can be no assurance that the various conditions will be satisfied or that the inotera transaction will ultimately be consummated. if the remaining closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, we will be unable to close the acquisition. in addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere, the acquisition is expected to involve the following significant risks: we may be unable to realize the anticipated financial benefits of the acquisition; increased exposure to the dram market, which experienced significant declines in pricing during 2015 and 2016; our consolidated financial condition may be adversely impacted by the increased leverage resulting from the transaction; higher capital expenditures in future periods; 15 increased exposure to operating costs denominated in new taiwan dollars; integration issues with inotera's manufacturing operations in taiwan; and integration of business systems and processes. our proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera is inherently risky, may not be successful, and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements proposed acquisition of inotera.") our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies. our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram and nand flash face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements, and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies . there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. in 2015, we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology, which is an entirely new class of non-volatile memory. there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful. if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products, including system-level memory products, which complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop dram, nand flash, and certain specialty memory products, requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance of the following: that our product development efforts will be successful; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these products; that we will be able to qualify new products with our customers on a timely basis; or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. if our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product and to replace products; 16 we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property, could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies.") we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings, filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera memories, inc. (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 55% of our total shares in inotera as of september 1, 2016, and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments: (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. we have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court. we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, or financial condition. as of september 1, 2016 , the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of $674 million and a market value of $996 million . 17 our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks. we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel and our inotera joint venture with nanya. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners or we may not be able to agree with partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in our joint venture; our joint venture partners' products may compete with our products; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; we may recognize losses from our equity method investments; due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, we and our partners may not participate to the same extent on funding capital investments in our joint ventures; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements; we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners; the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the u.s., singapore, taiwan, japan, malaysia, and china. additionally, our control over operations at imft, inotera, and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, equipment failures, earthquakes, or other environmental events. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenues, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may incur additional restructure charges in future periods. in the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save, as compared to our previously planned spending levels, approximately $80 million per quarter in 2017. the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs, the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions, workforce reductions in certain areas of the business, and other non-headcount related spending reductions. in connection with the plan, we expect to incur charges of $80 million , substantially all in cash expenditures, of which $58 million was incurred in 2016, with the remainder in the early part of 2017. we may not realize the expected quarterly cost savings. we may also incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods. in connection with those initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products. 18 the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings. because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj, the japan proceedings are continuing, and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the japan proceedings. the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies' plans of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made, there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition. during the pendency of the japan proceedings, the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling disputes, or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies. accordingly, during the pendency of the japan proceedings, our ability to effectively operate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks. in 2016, we purchased $1.43 billion of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 30% of our aggregate dram gigabit production. in 2015 and 2014, our cost for inotera products was higher than the cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities. due to declines in average selling prices, our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016. due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our wholly-owned operations, our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20% higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our wholly-owned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016. if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the following: higher costs for supply obtained under the inotera supply agreement as compared to our wholly-owned facilities; difficulties and delays in ramping production at inotera; difficulties in transferring technology to inotera; and difficulties in coming to an agreement with nanya regarding major corporate decisions, such as capital expenditures or capital structure. 19 changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. across our global operations, certain transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, and yen. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $24 million for 2016, $27 million for 2015, and $28 million for 2014. based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $241 million as of september 1, 2016 . although we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days, the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. in the event that exchange rates for the u.s. dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures, our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. in addition, in connection with our proposed acquisition of inotera, our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase if not offset by corresponding hedges. we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks including the following: integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; diverting management's attention from daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in previous years, supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram, nand flash, and nor flash products. resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants, including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida (now known as mmj). these types of proceedings often lead to court-directed processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets. we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors, and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, high-technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 20 breaches of our security systems could expose us to losses. we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. in addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers, and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised. compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations. the dodd-frank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free. we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities. the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. additionally, we partner with other companies in our joint ventures, which are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations. our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations. our failure, or the failure of our joint ventures, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in: suspension of production; remediation costs; alteration of our manufacturing processes; regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; and reputational challenges. we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we operate in a number of locations outside the u.s., including in singapore, and, to a lesser extent, taiwan, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure and intercompany transfer pricing agreements, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, and changes in tax laws and regulations. we file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world. our u.s. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2012 through 2016. in addition, tax returns open to examination in singapore, japan, and taiwan range from the years 2011 to 2016. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. 21 we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets. we have substantial deferred tax assets, which include, among others, net operating loss and credit carryforwards. as of september 1, 2016, our u.s. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, including uncertain tax benefits, were $3.90 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036. as of september 1, 2016, our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $6.04 billion, including $4.28 billion pertaining to japan, which will, if not utilized, substantially all expire at various dates from 2019 through 2025. as of september 1, 2016, we had valuation allowances of $1.16 billion and $765 million against our net deferred tax assets in the u.s. and japan, respectively. a change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. if we experience a 50% or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5% or more of our stock, it could adversely impact our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards. the inability to utilize existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of our annual cash taxes reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business. on july 20, 2016, our board of directors adopted a section 382 rights agreement (the "rights agreement"), under which our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 1, 2016 received one right for each share of common stock outstanding. the rights agreement is intended to avoid an ownership change, as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, and thereby preserve our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards. in general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5% shareholders has increased by more than 50% at any time during the prior three years. pursuant to the rights agreement, if a shareholder (or group) acquires beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board of directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions, the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders (other than the acquiring shareholder or group) to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of acquiring shareholder or group. although the rights agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us, there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. the rights agreement is subject to shareholder approval at the company's fiscal 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. if not approved by the shareholders, the rights agreement will terminate on july 19, 2017. the limited availability of raw materials, supplies, or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third party services, that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers, controllers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier's limited capacity. our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp. if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 22 a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, ssds, and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84% of our consolidated net sales for 2016. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore, taiwan, and japan. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; theft of intellectual property; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels; disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped-call contracts on our stock, and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 23 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. a substantial portion of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of september 1, 2016 and september 3, 2015 , a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our notes payable by approximately $420 million and $366 million, respectively. a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately $10 million per year. as of september 1, 2016 and september 3, 2015 , we held fixed-rate debt securities of $1.11 billion and $3.83 billion, respectively, that were subject to interest rate risk. we estimate that a 0.5% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately $1 million as of september 1, 2016 and $13 million as of september 3, 2015 . foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in "part i item 1a. risk factors." changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for us and all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the u.s. dollar. the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, and yen. we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $241 million as of september 1, 2016 and $134 million as of september 3, 2015 . we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days. the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures, we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months. (see "risk factors." all period references are to our fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. overview micron technology, inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries, is an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions. through our global brands micron , crucial , and ballistix our broad portfolio of high-performance memory and storage technologies, including dram, nand, nor flash, and 3d xpoint memory, is transforming how the world uses information to enrich life. backed by more than 35 years of technology leadership, our memory and storage solutions enable disruptive trends, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous vehicles in key market segments like cloud, data center, networking, and mobile. we manufacture our products at our worldwide, wholly-owned and joint venture facilities. in recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions, expansion, and various partnering arrangements. we make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technology, which is implemented in our manufacturing facilities. we generally increase the density per wafer and reduce manufacturing costs of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology, such as our leading-edge line-width process technology and 3d nand architecture. we continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. storage products incorporating nand, a controller, and firmware constitute a significant and increasing portion of our sales. we generally develop firmware and expect to introduce proprietary controllers into our ssds in 2018. development of advanced technologies enables us to diversify our product portfolio toward a richer mix of differentiated, high-value solutions and target high-growth markets. we market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives, and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets and, in order to remain competitive, we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs. our success is largely dependent on market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development and integration of advanced product and process technology, return-driven capital spending, and successful r&amp;d investments. to leverage our significant investments in r&amp;d, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory and storage product and process technology with third parties. in addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties. we continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. acquisition of inotera through december 6, 2016, we held a 33% ownership interest in inotera (now known as mttw), nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32% ownership interest, and the remaining ownership interest was publicly held. on december 6, 2016, we acquired the remaining 67% interest in inotera and began consolidating inotera's operating results. inotera manufactures dram products at its 300mm wafer fabrication facility in taoyuan city, taiwan, and previously sold such products exclusively to us through supply agreements. the inotera acquisition enhances our flexibility to drive new technology, optimize the deployment of capital, and adapt our product offerings to changes in market conditions. for more information regarding the 1 inotera acquisition, see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements acquisition of inotera." business segments we have the following four business units, which are our reportable segments: compute and networking business unit ("cnbu") : includes memory products sold into compute, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets. storage business unit ("sbu") : includes memory and storage products sold into enterprise, client, cloud, and removable storage markets. sbu also includes products sold to intel through our imft joint venture. mobile business unit ("mbu") : includes memory products sold into smartphone, tablet, and other mobile-device markets. embedded business unit ("ebu") : includes memory products sold into automotive, industrial, connected home, and consumer electronics markets. for more information regarding our segments, see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements segment information." products our product portfolio of memory and storage solutions is based on our high-performance semiconductor memory and storage technologies, which include dram, nand, 3d xpoint memory, and other technologies. we offer products in various forms, including wafers, components, and modules, as well as ssds and multiple chip packages that combine our nand with controllers and firmware. dram dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval with a variety of performance, pricing, and other characteristics. sales of dram products were 64%, 58%, and 64% of our total net sales in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. wafer, component, and module dram : ddr3 and ddr4 dram products offer high speed and bandwidth, primarily for use in computers, servers, networking devices, communications equipment, consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications. in 2017, we offered ddr4 and ddr3 products in 1gb to 8gb densities. sales of ddr4 products increased significantly in 2017 and we expect further increases in 2018 as ddr4 dram replaces ddr3 dram products in many applications. aggregate sales of ddr3 and ddr4 dram products were 40%, 31%, and 38% of our total net sales in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. lpdram products offer lower power consumption relative to other dram products and are used primarily in smartphones, tablets, automotive applications, laptop computers, and other mobile consumer devices that require low power consumption. aggregate sales of our lpddr4, lpddr3, and other versions of lpdram products were 18% of our total net sales in each of 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 . we offer other dram products targeted to specialty markets, including ddr2 dram, ddr dram, gddr5 and gddr5x dram, sdram, and rldram. these products are used in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, computer peripherals, automotive and industrial applications, and computer memory upgrades. other : we offer hmc products, which are semiconductor memory devices where vertical stacks of dram die connected using through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer. nand nand products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory and storage devices that retain content when power is turned off. nand sales were 32%, 37%, and 33% of our total net sales in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. nand is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories. nand-based storage devices are utilized in smartphones, ssds, tablets, computers, automotive and industrial applications, networking, and other consumer applications. removable storage devices, such as usb and flash 2 memory cards, are used with applications such as pcs, digital still cameras, and smartphones. the market for nand products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to increased demand for these and other embedded and removable storage devices. wafer and component nand : our nand products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. we began selling commercial volumes of new products featuring our 3d nand technology in 2016 and it composed 43% of our total trade nand sales in 2017. we expect 3d nand sales to continue to increase in 2018. 3d nand stacks layers of data storage cells vertically to create storage devices with higher capacity than competing planar nand technologies. this enables more storage in a smaller space, bringing significant cost savings, low power usage and high performance to a range of mobile consumer devices as well as the most demanding enterprise deployments. we are currently in production of mlc and tlc versions of 3d nand and, in 2017, tlc comprised a majority of our 3d nand production. the significant majority of our 3d nand products sold in 2017 featured 32 layers and we began ramping next generation 3d nand products with 64 layers in 2017. we also offer high speed slc, mlc, and tlc planar nand products that are compatible with advanced interfaces in 1gb to 128gb densities. ssds : ssds incorporate nand, a controller, and firmware and are a significant portion of our net sales. we offer client, cloud, and enterprise ssds which feature higher performance, reduced-power consumption, and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. our client ssds are targeted at notebooks, desktops, workstations, and other consumer applications. increasingly our ssds are being utilized in large-scale cloud environments. using our 3d nand process technology, our ssds deliver read and write speeds that help improve boot and application load times and deliver higher performance than hard disk drives. our client ssds, including our newest line of 3d nand ssds, deliver world-class data storage, endurance, power efficiency, reliability, and performance for corporate users and are offered in sata and pcie nvme solutions, with densities up to 2 terabytes, in 2.5-inch and m.2 form factors. our enterprise ssds are targeted at server and storage applications and incorporate our extended performance and enhanced reliability technology ("xpert") architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements. the end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection, and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency. we offer enterprise ssds with pcie nvme, sas, and sata interfaces, with capacities up to 3.2 terabytes. we generally develop firmware and expect to introduce proprietary controllers into our ssds in 2018, which will enable us to offer additional differentiated storage solutions for our customers. sales of our client and cloud ssds increased significantly in 2017, both in aggregate and as a percentage of our overall sales, and we expect this trend to continue over the next several years. mcps and managed nand : we offer mcp products that combine nand with lpdram to enable small form-factor solutions that combine storage and execution memory. we also offer managed nand products including e-mmc, ufs, and embedded usb. our e-mmc products combine nand with a logic controller that performs media management and error code correction ("ecc"), which provides reduced ecc complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration, and lower overall system costs. our e-mcp products combine e-mmc with lpdram on the same substrate, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design. mcp products are used in smartphone, automotive, industrial, and other consumer applications. our mcp and managed nand products generally feature proprietary firmware and leverage our expertise in nand and dram technologies. 3d xpoint memory and other 3d xpoint memory : we introduced 3d xpoint technology, a new category of non-volatile memory, in 2015. 3d xpoint memory's innovative, transistor-less, cross point architecture creates a three-dimensional checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. as a result, data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to fast and efficient read/write processes. we began producing 3d xpoint memory in 2016 and significantly increased production in 2017. other : other products included primarily nor flash, which are electrically re-writeable semiconductor memory devices that offer fast read times and are used in automotive, industrial, connected home, and consumer applications. 3 imft since 2006, we have owned 51% of imft, a joint venture between us and intel to manufacture memory products exclusively for its members, who share the output of imft in proportion to their investment under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. in 2017, imft began to transition its manufacturing from nand to 3d xpoint memory products. we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand and 3d xpoint memory at imft and our other facilities. imft is governed by a board of managers for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. the imft joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights. through december 2018, intel can put to us, and from january 2019 through december 2021, we can call from intel, intel's interest in imft, in either case, for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to intel at such time either member exercises its right. if intel exercises its put right, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from intel for one to two years from the closing date. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries imft.") manufacturing our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, china, japan, malaysia, singapore, and taiwan. nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment. our dram, nand, 3d xpoint memory, and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3d non-volatile layers, nand cell levels, process complexity, including number of mask layers and fabrication steps, and manufacturing yield. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, and cleanliness of our manufacturing environment. we continuously enhance our production processes, increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products. in 2017, we significantly increased our volume production of 1xnm process node dram and, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, manufactured a majority of our nand production using our first generation 32-layer 3d nand technology. in 2017, we began ramping production of our second generation 64-layer 3d nand technology and tlc products became the majority of our 3d nand output. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and air particle defects. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e., "bare die") forms. our packaged products include memory modules, ssds, mcps, managed nand, and hmcs. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. we subcontract assembly services for the production of certain memory modules, ssds, and mcps. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. we use subcontractors to perform certain testing services. 4 in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. availability of raw materials and use of service providers our operations require raw materials, and in some cases, third-party services, that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages may occur, from time to time, in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. the disruption of our supply of raw materials or services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, result of operations, or financial condition. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. we have supply chain risk monitoring and management to mitigate our risks associated with raw materials and service providers. marketing and customers for 2017 , 20% of our net sales were to the compute and graphics market (including desktop pcs, notebooks, and workstations); 20% were to mobile; 20% were to ssd and other storage; 15% were to automotive, industrial, medical, and other embedded; and 15% were to server. sales to kingston technology corporation consisted primarily of dram and, as a percentage of total net sales, were 10% , 7%, and 11% for 2017 , 2016, and 2015 , respectively. sales to intel, including non-trade sales through imft, as a percentage of total net sales, were 9%, 14% , and 8% for 2017, 2016 , and 2015, respectively. no other customer exceeded 10% of our total net sales for 2017, 2016, or 2015. our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron, crucial, and ballistix brand names and private labels. we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel, as well as through channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors, who obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. we then make shipments against these orders directly to our customers. distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end 5 uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period. under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity and bits per wafer, which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage products also result from capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures or increase capacity at existing or new facilities, resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. many of our high-volume memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and, as such, have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these high-volume products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors. for our other products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing. research and development our process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of process technology that enables continuous improvement to cost structures and performance enhancements for our future dram and nand products. we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr4 and ddr5 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile 3d nand (including tlc and qlc technologies), 3d xpoint memory, ssds (including firmware and controllers), managed nand, specialty memory, and other memory technologies and systems. our r&amp;d expenses were $1.82 billion , $1.62 billion , and $1.54 billion in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand and 3d xpoint memory. our r&amp;d expenses reflect net reductions of $213 million , $205 million , and $224 million for 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements with intel. to compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and storage products and solutions. our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest r&amp;d center located in boise, idaho and other significant r&amp;d centers in japan, china, italy, singapore, and other sites in the united states. in 2017, we began ramping operations in an expansion of our r&amp;d facility in boise. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. development of a 6 product is deemed complete when it is qualified through thorough reviews and tests for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $17.56 billion for 2017 and included sales of $10.39 billion in china, $2.54 billion in taiwan, $1.36 billion in europe, $1.03 billion in japan, and $1.81 billion in the rest of the asia pacific region. sales to customers outside the united states totaled $10.47 billion for 2016 and $13.63 billion for 2015 . as of august 31, 2017 , we had net property, plant, and equipment of $6.52 billion in taiwan, $5.26 billion in singapore, $4.25 billion in the united states, $2.83 billion in japan, $453 million in china, and $118 million in other countries. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information" and "item 1a. risk factors.") patents and licenses in recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of august 31, 2017 , we owned approximately 15,500 u.s. patents and 5,000 foreign patents. in addition, we have thousands of u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2037. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. employees as of august 31, 2017 , we had approximately 34,100 employees. environmental compliance we approach environmental stewardship and sustainability proactively to ensure we meet all government regulations regarding raw materials, discharges, emissions, and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of the international organization for standardization ("iso") 14001 environmental management systems standard to ensure we are continuously improving our performance. as part of the iso 14001 framework, we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping, and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our executive officers are appointed annually by our board of directors (the "board") and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors appointed by the board to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by our shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their

the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors, the order of which is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. any of the factors below could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. we have experienced volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products which may adversely affect our business. we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices, including dramatic declines, as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. decreases in average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. dram trade nand (percentage change in average selling prices) 2017 from 2016 19 % (9 )% 2016 from 2015 (35 )% (20 )% 2015 from 2014 (11 )% (17 )% 2014 from 2013 6 % (23 )% 2013 from 2012 (11 )% (18 )% we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins. our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, additional 3d memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, 3d memory layers, nand cell levels, process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps, manufacturing yield, technological barriers, changes in process technologies, and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio, which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles. our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments, such as china, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have 11 cost or performance advantages. the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. in recent periods, our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business, business acquisitions, and the restructuring of our capital structure. as of august 31, 2017 , we had debt with a carrying value of $11.13 billion . in addition, the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes, as of august 31, 2017 was $1.91 billion , based on the trading price of our common stock of $31.97 as of august 31, 2017 . in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 we paid $ 1.63 billion , $94 million , and $1.43 billion, respectively, to repurchase and settle notes with principal amounts of $ 1.55 billion , $ 57 million , and $489 million, respectively. as of august 31, 2017 , we had a revolving credit facility that provided for additional borrowings of up to $750 million based on eligible receivables. events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize this revolving credit facility. we have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; require us to use cash and/or issue shares of our common stock to settle any conversion obligations of our convertible notes; result in certain of our debt instruments being accelerated to be immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if certain terms of default are triggered, such as applicable cross payment default and/or cross-acceleration provisions; result in all obligations owing under the 2021 mstw term loan being accelerated to be immediately due and payable if mstw fails to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants; increase the interest rate under the 2021 mstw term loan if we or mstw fails to maintain certain financial covenants; adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, r&amp;d, and other general corporate requirements; restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory and storage industry conditions; increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness; continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; and require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d, and product and process technology. we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2018 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $7.5 billion plus or minus 5 percent, which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners. investments in capital expenditures, offset by amounts funded by our partners, were $5.13 billion for 2017. as of august 31, 2017 , we had cash and marketable investments of $6.05 billion . as of august 31, 12 2017 , $1.29 billion of cash and marketable investments, including substantially all of the cash held by the mmj group, mstw, and mttw, was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the united states would subject these funds to u.s. federal income taxes. in addition, cash of $87 million held by imft was generally not available to finance our other operations. the 2021 mstw term loan contains covenants that limit or restrict mstw's ability to create liens in or dispose of collateral securing obligations under the 2021 mstw term loan, mergers involving mstw and/or mttw, loans or guarantees to third parties by mttw and/or mstw, and mstw's and/or mttw's distribution of cash dividends. as a result, the assets of mstw and/or mttw are not available for use by us in our other operations. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in 2012, and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, mmj is prohibited from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and such proceedings require that excess earnings be used in mmj's business or to fund the mmj creditor payments. in addition, pursuant to an order of the japan court, mmj cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the japan court and may, under certain circumstances, be subject to approval of the legal trustee. as a result, the assets of mmj are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of mmj, including certain capital expenditures of mmj and mmt or further investments in mmt, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the japan court. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies. our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs, meet higher density requirements, and improve power consumption and reliability. to meet these requirements, we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory and storage industry. our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. we develop and produce 3d xpoint memory, which is a new class of non-volatile technology. there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful. our unsuccessful efforts to develop new semiconductor memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance of the following: that our product development efforts will be successful; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these products; 13 that we will be able to qualify new products with our customers on a timely basis; or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks. we have entered into strategic relationships, including our imft joint venture with intel, to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations. these risks include the following: our interests could diverge from our partners' interests or we may not be able to agree with our partners on ongoing manufacturing and operational activities, or on the amount, timing, or nature of further investments in our joint ventures; our joint venture partners' products may compete with our products; we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; we may experience difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; our control over the operations of our joint ventures is limited; due to financial constraints, our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them; due to differing business models or long-term business goals, we and our partners may not participate to the same extent on funding capital investments in our joint ventures; cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements of our joint ventures; we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners; the terms of our partnering arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. our joint ventures and strategic relationships, if unsuccessful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a significant concentration of our net sales are to a select number of customers. in each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total net sales were to our top ten customers. a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. in addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold. our inability to meet our customers' requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our sales. the loss of one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions. our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers' specifications of those products. developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products in sufficient volume, quantity, and in a timely manner. if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis, or at all, that comply with our customers' specifications or achieve design wins with our customers, we may experience a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins. even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. our competitors' products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customer's ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. if we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 14 even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs exceed our per-unit selling prices. manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discreet products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. additionally, some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. additionally, we may update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. system complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or firmware in a timely manner, may result in reduced demand for our system-level products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result, we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our relationships with existing or potential customers. any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including u.s. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology. the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do u.s. laws and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense. due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results, a decline in our operating results and/or stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent, in part, upon the market price of our common stock, achieving certain performance metrics, levels of company profitability, or other financial or company-wide performance. if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment. our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others, or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. a determination that our products or manufacturing 15 processes infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others, or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property, could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies.") we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states, singapore, taiwan, japan, malaysia, and china. additionally, our control over operations at imft is limited by our agreements with intel. from time to time, we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, equipment failures, earthquakes, or other environmental events. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenues, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda's insolvency proceedings, filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void, under section 133 of the german insolvency act, a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008, pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 18% of inotera's outstanding shares, and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate, under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code, a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments: (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on the inotera shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by micron b.v. and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by micron b.v. from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. we have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court. we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and, therefore, cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 16 we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods. in separate transactions in 2017, we sold our assembly and test facility located in akita, japan and our 40% ownership interest in tera probe; assets associated with our 200mm fabrication facility in singapore; and assets related to our lexar brand. in 2016, we initiated a restructure plan in response to business conditions and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities. the plan included the elimination of certain projects and programs, the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions, workforce reductions in certain areas of our business, and other non-headcount related spending reductions. as a result of these and other actions, we incurred charges of $18 million , $67 million , and $3 million in 2017 , 2016 , and 2015 , respectively. we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. in connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. breaches of our security systems could expose us to losses. we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. in addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, and yen. we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of $74 million for 2017, $24 million for 2016, and $27 million for 2015. based on our foreign currency balances of monetary assets and liabilities, as of august 31, 2017 , we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $391 million . although we hedge our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. exchange rates for the u.s. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; diverting management's attention from daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; 17 requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in previous years, supply of memory and storage products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram and nand. the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. we engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the limited availability of raw materials, supplies, or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our operations require raw materials, and in certain cases, third party services, that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages may occur, from time to time, in the future. we and/or our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. the disruption of our supply of raw materials or services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers' limited capacity. our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, ssds, and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, a downturn in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events, such as earthquakes or tsunamis, that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our 18 operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the operations of mmj are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings. because mmj's plan of reorganization provides for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj, the reorganization proceedings in japan (the "japan proceedings") are continuing and mmj remains subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the japan court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the reorganization proceedings. the business trustee is responsible for overseeing the operation of the business of mmj, other than oversight in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings, which are the responsibility of the legal trustee. mmj's reorganization proceedings in japan, and oversight of the japan court, will continue until the final creditor payment is made under mmj's plan of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. mmj may petition the japan court for an early termination of the reorganization proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plan of reorganization are made. although such early terminations are customarily granted, there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in this particular case. during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan, mmj is obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to its businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling material disputes, or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of mmj or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of mmj's plan of reorganization. accordingly, during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan, our ability to operate mmj as part of our global business or to cause mmj to take certain actions that we deem advisable for its business could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to mmj. the operations of mmj being subject to the continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we operate in a number of locations outside the united states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing agreements, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, and changes in tax laws and regulations. we file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world. our u.s. federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2013 through 2017. in addition, tax returns that remain open to examination in japan range from the years 2011 to 2017 and in singapore and taiwan from 2012 to 2017. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets. we have substantial deferred tax assets, which include, among others, net operating loss and credit carryforwards. as of august 31, 2017 , our u.s. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, including uncertain tax benefits, were $3.88 billion and $1.95 billion , respectively, which, if not utilized, will expire at various dates from 2028 through 2037 and 2018 through 2037, respectively. as of august 31, 2017 , our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were $6.30 billion , which will, if not utilized, substantially all expire at various dates from 2019 through 2026. as of august 31, 2017 , we had gross deferred tax assets of $3.78 billion and valuation allowances of $2.32 billion against our deferred tax assets. if we repatriate earnings from our subsidiaries whose earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested, a portion of our net operating losses would be utilized. utilization of all of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards would increase the amount of our annual cash taxes 19 reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards. on january 18, 2017, our shareholders approved a section 382 rights agreement (the "rights agreement"), under which our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 1, 2016 received one right for each share of common stock outstanding, which entitles certain shareholders to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount in the event of certain transactions that may result in an ownership change, as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended (the "code"). in general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5% shareholders has increased by more than 50% at any time during the prior three years. rights will attach to all shares of the company's common stock issued prior to the earlier of the rights' distribution date or expiration date as set forth in the rights agreement. pursuant to the rights agreement, if a shareholder (or group) acquires beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board or without meeting certain customary exceptions, the rights (other than rights held by the acquiring shareholder (or group) and certain related persons) would become exercisable. the rights agreement is intended to avoid an adverse ownership change, thereby preserving our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards; however, there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change. if we experience a 50% or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5% or more of our common stock, it could adversely impact our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards. the inability to utilize existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of our annual cash taxes and reduce the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") and its implementing sec regulations. the dodd-frank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free. our inability to comply with the regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities. the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. additionally, we partner with other companies in our joint ventures, which are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations. our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations. as a result of these items, we could experience the following: suspension of production; remediation costs; alteration of our manufacturing processes; regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; and reputational challenges. 20 our failure, or the failure of our joint ventures, to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 86% of our consolidated net sales for 2017. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore, taiwan, and japan. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; theft of intellectual property; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of our products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on our ability to maintain flexibility with our staffing levels; disruptions to our manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped call contracts on our common stock, and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. as of august 31, 2017 and september 1, 2016 , we had debt with fixed interest rates of $5.7 billion and $7.5 billion, respectively, and as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of august 31, 2017 and september 1, 2016 , a decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $273 million and $420 million, respectively. as of august 31, 2017 and september 1, 2016 , we had debt with variable interest rates of $4.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. as of august 31, 2017 and september 1, 2016 , a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately $43 million and $10 million per year, respectively. as of august 31, 2017 and september 1, 2016 , we held fixed-rate debt investment securities of $1.48 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively, which were subject to interest rate risk. we estimate that a 0.5% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately $2 million as of august 31, 2017 and $1 million as of september 1, 2016 . foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in "part i item 1a. risk factors." changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our debt, operating expenditures, and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, new taiwan dollar, singapore dollar, and yen. we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $391 million as of august 31, 2017 and $241 million as of september 1, 2016 . we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within nine months. in addition, we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that mature in december 2017 and december 2018 to hedge our currency exchange rate risk on certain debt. the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent, among other factors, upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures, we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months.

first high-performance ufs managed nand products introduced in the fourth quarter of 2018. 2 storage business unit sbu includes ssds and component-level solutions sold into enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer storage markets as well as other discrete storage products sold in component and wafer forms to the removable storage markets. sbu sales also include "non-trade" products consisting of products manufactured and sold to intel through imft under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost, which included 3d xpoint memory and nand products. sbu reported revenue of $5.02 billion in 2018, $4.51 billion in 2017, and $3.26 billion in 2016. in 2018, we continued to ramp our 64-layer 3d nand technology and achieved bit output crossover relative to 32-layer in the second half of 2018. in 2018, we also extended our leadership position in 3d nand technology by delivering the industry's first commercially available qlc 3d nand technology. leveraging our 64-layer structure, the new qlc nand technology achieves 1 terabit ("tb") density per die, which has a 33% higher array density as compared to tlc, enabling new operating points for density and cost in the enterprise, cloud, and client-storage markets. in 2018, we advanced development of our third-generation 96-tier 3d nand structure, providing a 50 percent increase in layers. both the 64-layer qlc and 96-layer tlc 3d nand technologies utilize cmos under the array ("cua") technology to reduce die sizes and deliver improved performance when compared to competitive approaches. by leveraging four planes versus two, our new nand flash memory can write and read more cells in parallel, which delivers faster throughput and higher bandwidth at the system level. ssds : ssd storage products incorporate nand, a controller, and firmware and offer benefits over hdds of a smaller form factor, faster read and write speeds, and solid-state architecture. ssds offer significant performance and features, including speed, reliability, and lower power consumption. we offer ssd solutions utilizing our nand technology to the enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer markets. enterprise and cloud ssds : sbu sales to the enterprise and cloud ssd markets in 2018 consisted primarily of our flagship sata 5100 and 5200 series ssds. in 2018, our sata 5200 series ssd achieved qualification at enterprise server oems, cloud service providers, and enterprise customers. similar to trends in the memory market, the enterprise and cloud storage markets have been driven by intelligent edge devices capable of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and other features that store, access, and analyze data in the cloud. artificial intelligence servers require significantly higher ssd capacity, and our 64-layer qlc nand technology provides cost-optimized storage solutions, providing significantly lower total cost of ownership for read-intensive cloud workloads. our 5200 series sata ssds, which deliver best-in-class performance and capacity, are based on the same proven architecture as our 5100 series. we shipped our first 5200 series sata ssds in the third quarter of 2018 and received broad acceptance in the enterprise and cloud ssd markets. by leveraging our advanced cua nand in enterprise and cloud ssds, we deliver low cost, high density, high performance storage solutions. client ssds : sbu sales to the client ssd market in 2018 consisted primarily of our 1100 series 3d nand sata client ssd, which is targeted for leading personal computer oems as a replacement to hdds. our client ssds, used in notebooks, desktops, workstations, and related consumer applications, deliver high performance, power efficiency, security, and capacity to our customers. in the first half of 2019, we expect to introduce our 2200 series 3d nand pcie client ssd incorporating our internally-developed controller, enabling us to offer additional differentiated storage solutions for our client customers. consumer ssds : sbu sales to the consumer ssd market in 2018 consisted primarily of our crucial-branded mx500 sata ssd, utilizing our 64-layer tlc 3d nand. similar to the client ssd market, our consumer ssd solutions are replacing hdds as end-users seek the higher performance, power savings, and reliability of our ssds. components and wafers: sbu sales of components and wafers in 2018 consisted primarily of our 32-layer tlc nand technology and our 64-layer tlc and qlc nand technology. we continue to transition our business from a storage components supplier to a storage solutions provider with a richer mix of high-value solutions such as ssds and mobile managed nand. as a result, sbu sales of products in component and wafer form declined in 2018 as compared to 2017. 3d xpoint memory : 3d xpoint memory has 10 times the chip density of dram, 1,000 times the endurance capability of nand, and is 1,000 times faster than nand. these specifications create a significant value opportunity for 3d xpoint memory in solutions between dram and nand in the memory and storage hierarchy. trends in machine learning, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence are driving demand for the features offered by 3d xpoint memory. we are collaborating with our customers to develop 3d xpoint memory products and expect to sample such products in late calendar 2019. 3 embedded business unit ebu includes memory and storage products sold into automotive, industrial, and consumer markets and includes discrete dram, discrete nand, managed nand, and nor. ebu reported revenue of $3.48 billion in 2018, $2.70 billion in 2017, and $1.94 billion in 2016. the embedded market is characterized by long life-cycle dram and nand products manufactured on our mature process technologies. our embedded products enable edge devices to store, connect, and share information in the growing internet of things ("iot") and are utilized in a diverse set of applications in the automotive, industrial, and consumer markets. automotive : our ddr3 dram and emmc managed nand automotive memory and storage products enable connected, large display infotainment systems and higher definition 4k displays and support improved voice and gesture control in automotive applications. our comprehensive and expanding portfolio of dram, nand, and nor solutions to the automotive market, as well as our

solution providers to promote surveillance-grade edge storage, utilizing our 64-layer tlc 3d nand technology. this newly released solution enables greater capacity in a smaller space, delivering up to 30 days of surveillance video storage in the camera. consumer : our ddr3 dram, slc nand, and emcp managed nand products sold into the consumer market are used in a diverse set of consumer products, including service provider and set-top boxes, digital still and video cameras, home networking, ultra-high definition televisions, and many more applications. our embedded memory and storage solutions enable edge devices in the consumer products market to store, connect, and share information in the iot. manufacturing we manufacture our products at our worldwide, wholly-owned and joint venture facilities located in taiwan, singapore, the united states, japan, and china and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment. our dram, nand, 3d xpoint memory, and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage much of our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3d non-volatile layers, nand cell levels, process complexity, including number of mask layers and fabrication steps, and manufacturing yield. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. we continuously enhance our production processes, increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products. in 2018, we significantly increased our volume production of 1xnm process node dram and expect to achieve bit crossover by the end of the first quarter of 2019. in 2018, we continued to ramp our 64-layer 3d nand technology and achieved bit output crossover relative to 32-layer in the second half of 2018. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and air particle defects. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. 4 we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e., "bare die") forms. our packaged products include memory modules, ssds, and managed nand including mcps and emmcs. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain memory modules, ssds, and mcps. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. arrangements with intel imft since 2006, we have owned 51% of imft, a joint venture between us and intel. imft is governed by a board of managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. imft manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. in the first quarter of 2018, imft discontinued production of nand and subsequent to that time has been entirely focused on 3d xpoint memory production. imft sales to intel were $507 million , $438 million , and $457 million in 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. the imft joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights. at any time through december 2018, intel can put to us, and from january 2019 through december 2021, we can call from intel, intel's interest in imft, in either case, for a price that approximates intel's interest in the net book value of imft plus member debt at the time of the closing. if intel exercises its put right, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction any time between six months and two years following such election by intel and we can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from intel for one to two years from the closing date. if we exercise our call right, intel can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time between six months and one year following such election. following the closing date resulting from exercise of either the put or the call, we will continue to supply to intel for a period of one year between 50% and 100% , at intel's choice, of intel's immediately preceding six -month period pre-closing volumes of imft products for the first six -month period following the closing and between 0% and 100% , at intel's choice, of intel's first six -month period following the closing volumes of imft products for the second six -month period following the closing, at a margin that varies depending on whether the put or call was exercised. imft's capital requirements are generally determined based on an annual plan approved by the members, and capital contributions to imft are requested as needed. capital requests are made to the members in proportion to their then-current ownership interest. members may elect to not contribute their proportional share, and in such event, the contributing member may elect to contribute any amount of the capital request, either in the form of an equity contribution or member debt financing. in 2018, intel provided debt financing of $1.01 billion to imft pursuant to the terms of the imft joint venture agreement. under the supply agreement, the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of imft in proportion to their investment, including member debt financing. any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight -month lag. members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with imft's capacity. r&amp;d arrangements we have agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel. we continue to jointly develop nand technologies with intel through the third generation of 3d nand, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. in the second quarter of 2018, we and intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3d nand in order to better optimize the technology and products for our respective business needs. we continue to jointly develop 3d xpoint technologies with intel through the second generation of 3d xpoint technology, which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. to better optimize 3d xpoint technology for our product roadmap and maximize the benefits for our 5 customers and shareholders, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we announced that we will no longer jointly develop with intel subsequent generations of 3d xpoint technology. as a result of the above actions, we expect reimbursements under our cost-sharing agreements to decrease in early fiscal 2019. supply chain, materials, and use of third-party service providers our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. certain raw materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth minerals available primarily from china, and trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such raw materials. we and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs, embargoes or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, and responsible sourcing practices, which could limit the supply of our raw materials and/or increase the cost. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. the disruption of our supply of raw materials, components, services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we monitor and manage supply-chain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers. marketing and customers we continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. we engage with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products that our customers need in their end products, and then manufacture products that better anticipate and fit their changing needs. by collaborating with our customers on their design needs in a changing end market, we differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers. our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron, crucial, and ballistix brand names and through private labels. we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors, and e-tailers. our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us, and we make shipments against the orders directly to our customers. our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. in each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total net sales were to our top ten customers. for other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements certain concentrations." 6 backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period. under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba memory corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. in particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china's stated national policy objectives. in addition, the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and, as such, have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors. 7 research and development our process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of process technology that enables continuous improvement to cost structures and performance enhancements for our future products. we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts include our high density ddr4 and ddr5 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile 3d nand (including tlc and qlc technologies), 3d xpoint memory, ssds (including firmware and controllers), managed nand, specialty memory, and other memory technologies and systems. to compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and storage products and solutions. our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest r&amp;d center located in boise, idaho and other r&amp;d centers in japan, china, italy, singapore, taiwan, and other sites in the united states. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. our r&amp;d expenses were $2.14 billion , $1.82 billion , and $1.62 billion for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively. we share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel. these r&amp;d expenses reflect net reductions of $201 million , $213 million , and $205 million for 2018 , 2017 , and 2016 , respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements with development partners. geographic information see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements geographic information." patents and licenses we are a recognized leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of august 30, 2018 , we owned approximately 13,750 active u.s. patents and 5,000 active foreign patents. in addition, we have thousands of u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2038. from time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investment in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. we have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. 8 employees as of august 30, 2018 , we had approximately 36,000 employees. environmental compliance we approach environmental stewardship and sustainability proactively to ensure we meet all government regulations regarding raw materials, discharges, emissions, and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of the international organization for standardization ("iso") 14001 environmental management systems standard to ensure we are continuously improving our performance. as part of the iso 14001 framework, we meet requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping, and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant our executive officers are appointed annually by our board of directors (the "board") and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. any directors

level of risk that each poses to us, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. any of the factors below could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. we have experienced volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products which may adversely affect our business. we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices, including dramatic declines, as noted in the table below, and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. decreases in average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. dram trade nand (percentage change in average selling prices) 2018 from 2017 37 % (11 )% 2017 from 2016 19 % (9 )% 2016 from 2015 (35 )% (20 )% 2015 from 2014 (11 )% (17 )% 2014 from 2013 6 % (23 )% we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins. our gross margins are dependent in part upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, additional 3d memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, 3d memory layers, nand cell levels, process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps, manufacturing yield, technological barriers, changes in process technologies, and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes. per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio, which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles. our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba memory corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments have provided, and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. in particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china's stated national policy objectives. in addition, the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some 12 of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d, and product and process technology. we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2019 for property, plant, and equipment will be approximately $10.5 billion plus or minus 5%, which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners. investments in capital expenditures, net of amounts funded by our partners, were $8.20 billion for 2018. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in 2012, and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, mmj is prohibited from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and such proceedings require that excess earnings be used in mmj's business or to fund the mmj creditor payments. in addition, pursuant to an order of the tokyo district court, mmj cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the tokyo district court and may, under certain circumstances, be subject to approval of the legal trustee. as a result, the assets of mmj are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of mmj, including certain capital expenditures of mmj, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the tokyo district court. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies. our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, and improving power consumption and reliability. we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per-unit cost. we have invested and expect to continue to invest in r&amp;d for new and existing products, which involves significant risk and uncertainties. we may be unable to recover our investment in r&amp;d or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. we develop and produce advanced memory technologies, including 3d xpoint memory, a new class of non-volatile technology. there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market new product technologies will be successful. unsuccessful efforts to develop new semiconductor memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 13 new product and market development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product and system-level solution development over the next several years. additionally, we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customer's ability to accurately forecast the end-customer's needs and preferences. as a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. in order to continue our success, we must develop, manufacture, and qualify the products our customers need at the time they need those products. the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. in addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand. such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. there can be no assurance of the following: that our product development efforts will be successful; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these products; that we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers with specific chip set or design requirements; that we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis; or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks. we have entered into strategic relationships, including our joint development partnership and our imft joint venture with intel, to develop new manufacturing process technologies and products and to manufacture certain products. these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations, including the following: diverging interests between us and our partners and disagreements on the following: ongoing or future development, manufacturing, or operational activities; the amount, timing, or nature of further investments; and commercial terms in our joint ventures or strategic relationships; competition from our partners; access by our partners to our proprietary product and process technology which they may use; difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; limited control over the operations of our joint ventures; inability of our partners to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures; differences in participation on funding capital investments in our joint ventures due to differing business models or long-term business goals; inadequate cash flows to fund increased capital requirements of our joint ventures; difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners; disputes with partners regarding the terms of arrangements or that terms of such arrangements are unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements that necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. our joint ventures and strategic relationships, if unsuccessful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a significant concentration of our net sales is to a select number of customers. in each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total net sales were to our top ten customers. a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. in addition, any consolidation of our 14 customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold. our inability to meet our customers' requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our sales. the loss of one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions. our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers' specifications for those products. developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products in sufficient volume, quantity, and in a timely manner. if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis, or at all, that comply with our customers' specifications or achieve design wins with our customers, we may experience a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins. even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. our competitors' products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers' ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. if we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs exceed our per-unit selling prices. manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. additionally, some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. additionally, we may need to update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. system complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or firmware in a timely manner, may result in reduced demand for our system-level products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. as a result, we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our relationships with existing or potential customers. any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. we have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. as of august 30, 2018 , we had debt with a carrying value of $4.64 billion and may borrow up to an additional $2.00 billion under an undrawn revolving credit facility. in addition, as of august 30, 2018 , the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes was $1.85 billion , based on the trading price of our common stock of $52.76 per share on such date. 15 our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; require us to use cash and/or issue shares of our common stock to settle any conversion obligations of our convertible notes; result in certain of our debt instruments being accelerated to be immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if certain terms of default are triggered, such as applicable cross payment default and/or cross-acceleration provisions; adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, r&amp;d, and other general corporate requirements; restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory and storage industry conditions; increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness; continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; and require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including u.s. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do u.s. laws and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense. due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results, a decline in our operating results and/or stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent, in part, upon the market price of our common stock, achieving certain performance metrics, levels of company profitability, or other financial or company-wide performance. if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment. our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 16 claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management's time and attention. as a result of these claims, we may be required to: pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. we may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies.") we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. the failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging patent infringement. we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging that we infringe certain chinese patents by manufacturing and selling certain products in china. the complaints seek orders requiring us to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in china, to stop manufacturing, using, selling, and offering for sale the accused products in china, and to pay damages plus court fees. we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our operations in china, products, and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies.") litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. any claim, with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results, disrupt our operations, and require significant attention from our management. we could be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising from our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners. we may also be associated with and subject to litigation arising from the actions of our subcontractors or business partners. we may also be subject to litigation as a result of indemnities we issue, primarily with our customers, the terms of our product warranties, and from product liability claims. as we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers' use of those products. there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. exposures to various litigation could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 17 if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states, singapore, taiwan, japan, malaysia, and china. additionally, our control over operations at imft is limited by our agreements with intel. from time to time, there have been disruptions in the manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, equipment failures, earthquakes, or other environmental events. if production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenues, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes on our products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations. in 2018, 88% of our sales were to customers located outside the united states. we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the united states. additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the united states, including taiwan, singapore, japan, and china. the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. general trade tensions between the u.s. and china have been escalating in 2018, with three rounds of u.s. tariffs on chinese goods taking effect in july, august, and september 2018, each followed by a round of retaliatory chinese tariffs on u.s. goods. some of our products are included in these announced tariffs. higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by u.s. and chinese leaders. if the u.s. were to impose additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source from china, our cost for such components would increase. we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations. further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial conditions. we must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. to remain competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other highly skilled employees. hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business, and competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. our inability to attract and retain key employees may inhibit our ability to expand our business operations. additionally, changes to immigration policies in the numerous countries in which we operate, including the united states, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in specific locations. if our total compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda's insolvency proceedings, filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor b.v., our netherlands subsidiary ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void, under section 133 of the german insolvency act, a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008, pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 18% of inotera's outstanding shares as of august 30, 2018 , and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate, under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code, a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. 18 following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments: (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on the inotera shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by micron b.v. and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by micron b.v. from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. we have filed a notice of appeal, and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court. we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and, therefore, cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. breaches of our security systems could expose us to losses. we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. in addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, and yen. although we hedge our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. exchange rates for the u.s. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; diverting management's attention from daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; 19 requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in previous years, supply of memory and storage products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices. the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. we engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment, or the dependency on third-party service providers. our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. certain raw materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth minerals available primarily from china, and trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such raw materials. we and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs, embargoes or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, and responsible sourcing practices, which could limit the supply of our raw materials and/or increase the cost. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. the disruption of our supply of raw materials, components, services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers' limited capacity. our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, ssds, and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, a downturn in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 20 our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events, including earthquakes or tsunamis, that could disrupt operations or result in construction delays. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster, fire, explosion, or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback. we have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production in those regions. these incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to perform or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives. we cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding. these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our performance with the terms and obligations. such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. for example, as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act (the "tax act") enacted on december 22, 2017 by the united states, our effective tax rate may increase to the low teens percentage in 2019, depending on the amount and geographic mix of our taxable income. additionally, various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic co-operation and development, which represents a coalition of member countries and recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. if adopted by countries, such changes, as well as changes in u.s. federal and state tax laws or in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we operate in a number of locations outside the united states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing agreements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, and changes in tax laws and regulations. additionally, we file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world and certain tax returns may remain open to examination for several years. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods. from time to time, we have, and may in the future, enter into restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. in connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, 21 and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a substantial majority of our consolidated net sales are to customers outside the united states. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore, taiwan, japan, and china. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; theft of intellectual property; political and economic instability; problems with the transportation or delivery of products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; disruptions to manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors operate internationally and are also subject to the foregoing risks. if we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. compliance with customer requirements and regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products. increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 (the "dodd-frank act") and its implementing sec regulations. the dodd-frank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo (the "drc") and finance or benefit local armed groups. these "conflict minerals" are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. the implementation of these regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials. this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free. in addition, many of our customers have or are planning to adopt responsible sourcing programs with requirements that our broader in terms of minerals and geographies than drc conflict minerals programs. our inability to comply with requirements regarding the use of conflict and other minerals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 22 we and others are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities. the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. additionally, we engage various third parties to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf and we partner with other companies in our joint ventures, all of whom are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations. our engagement with these third parties and our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations. as a result of these items, we could experience the following: suspension of production; remediation costs; alteration of our manufacturing processes; regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; and reputational challenges. our failure, or the failure of our third-party agents or joint ventures, to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped call contracts on our common stock, and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the operations of mmj are subject to continued oversight by the tokyo district court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings. because mmj's plan of reorganization provides for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj, the reorganization proceedings in japan (the "japan proceedings") are continuing and mmj remains subject to the oversight of the tokyo district court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the tokyo district court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the reorganization proceedings. the business trustee is responsible for overseeing the operation of the business of mmj, other than oversight in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings, which are the responsibility of the legal trustee. mmj's reorganization proceedings in japan, and oversight of the tokyo district court, will continue until the final creditor payment is made under mmj's plan of reorganization, which is scheduled to occur in december 2019, but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date. mmj may petition the tokyo district court for an early termination of the reorganization proceedings once two-thirds of all payments under the plan of reorganization are made. although such early terminations are customarily granted, there can be no assurance that the tokyo district court will grant any such petition in this particular case. during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan, mmj is obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the tokyo district court and may be required to obtain the consent of the tokyo district court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to its businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling material disputes, or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of mmj or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of mmj's plan of reorganization. accordingly, during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan, our ability to operate mmj as part of our global business or to cause mmj to take certain actions that we deem 23 advisable for its business could be adversely affected if the tokyo district court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to mmj. the operations of mmj being subject to the continued oversight by the tokyo district court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. as of august 30, 2018 and august 31, 2017 , we had fixed-rate debt of $3.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, and as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of august 30, 2018 and august 31, 2017 , a decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $79 million and $273 million, respectively. as of august 30, 2018 and august 31, 2017 , we had variable-rate debt of $725 million and $4.2 billion, respectively. as of august 30, 2018 and august 31, 2017 , a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $7 million and $43 million, respectively. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in "part i item 1a. risk factors." changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our debt, operating expenditures, and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, new taiwan dollar, singapore dollar, and yen. we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $78 million as of august 30, 2018 and $391 million as of august 31, 2017 . we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within nine months. the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent, among other factors, upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures, we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months.

reality, and life-like virtual reality capabilities into high-end phones, including facial and voice recognition, real-time translation, fast image search, and scene detection. our managed nand bit shipments in 2019 more than tripled year-on-year, driven by growth of mcp and discrete nand e.mmc and ufs products. in the fourth quarter of 2019, we started volume shipments of a new leading-edge ufs-based mcp ("umcp") that uses our 1z lpdram. this new ufs mcp enables flagship-like performance and densities to mid and high-end smartphones. our lpdram solutions are engineered to meet the demanding performance and power specifications of industry-leading smartphone manufacturers. 3 other : mbu sales also include products sold into the feature phone, mobile pc, and tablet markets. sales primarily consist of lpddr4, lpddr3, and tlc nand. storage business unit sbu includes ssds and component-level solutions sold into enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer storage markets and other discrete storage products sold in component and wafer forms to removable storage markets. sbu reported revenue of $3.83 billion in 2019, $5.02 billion in 2018, and $4.51 billion in 2017. in 2019, we continued to ramp our 96-layer 3d nand, enabling cost reductions as compared to our 64-layer 3d nand. our 3d nand technologies utilize cmos under the array ("cua") technology to reduce die sizes and deliver improved performance when compared to competitive approaches. in 2019, we continued to make progress on our 128-layer 3d nand, which uses replacement gate technology. our first replacement gate node will be based on our 128-layer 3d nand, but is expected to be used across a select set of products. with the high initial capital requirements of transitioning from floating gate to replacement gate technology, we don't expect meaningful cost reductions until 2021, when our second-generation replacement gate node is broadly deployed. we believe our replacement gate architecture will allow us to deliver performance improvements and provide an efficient path towards scaling multiple future generations of 3d nand. given a more limited initial deployment of our first node of replacement gate technology, we expect that our nand bit supply growth in calendar 2020 will be below industry demand levels and plan to utilize our cost-effective floating gate inventory to meet growth in customer demand. ssds : ssd storage products incorporate nand, a controller, and firmware and offer significant performance and features over hdds, including a smaller form factor, faster read and write speeds, solid-state architecture, reliability, and lower power consumption. we offer ssd solutions utilizing our nand technology to the enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer markets. enterprise and cloud ssds : sbu sales to the enterprise and cloud ssd markets in 2019 consisted primarily of our flagship sata 5200 and 5100 series ssds. in 2019, we continued offering our 5200 series sata ssds, which deliver best-in-class performance and capacity and achieved revenue crossover from our 5100 series ssds. in 2019, we launched our 9300 datacenter nvme ssds for enterprise and cloud markets. these 9300 nvme ssds feature industry-leading sequential write performance and latency, increased capacities, and nearly a 30% reduction in power consumption over the previous generation. similar to trends in the memory market, the enterprise and cloud storage markets have been driven by intelligent edge devices capable of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and other features that store, access, and analyze data in the cloud. artificial intelligence servers require significantly higher ssd capacity and our 64-layer qlc nand technology provides cost-optimized storage solutions with significantly lower total cost of ownership for read-intensive cloud workloads. by leveraging our advanced cua nand in enterprise and cloud ssds, we deliver low-cost, high-density, high-performance storage solutions. client ssds : sbu sales to the client ssd market in 2019 consisted primarily of our 1100 series 3d nand sata client ssds, which are targeted for

replacing hdds as end-users seek the higher performance, power savings, and reliability of our ssds. components and wafers: sbu sales of components in 2019 included nand products and 3d xpoint technology. nand products primarily consist of our 64-layer and 96-layer tlc and qlc nand technology sold into storage markets. sales of 3d xpoint technology includes wafers sold to intel through our imft joint venture. 3d xpoint technology has higher chip density than dram, up to 1,000 times lower latency, and exponentially greater endurance than nand. these specifications 4 create a significant value opportunity for 3d xpoint technology in solutions between dram and nand in the memory and storage hierarchy. we continue to develop products and solutions for 3d xpoint technology in the memory and storage hierarchies. revenue from sales of 3d xpoint products are included within the business unit that most closely aligns to the memory or storage use of the end product. trends in machine learning, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence are driving demand for the features offered by 3d xpoint technology. embedded business unit ebu includes memory and storage products sold into automotive, industrial, and consumer markets and includes discrete and module dram, discrete nand, managed nand, and nor. ebu reported revenue of $3.14 billion in 2019, $3.48 billion in 2018, and $2.70 billion in 2017. the embedded market has traditionally been characterized by long life-cycle dram and non-volatile products manufactured on mature process technologies. with strong trends of digitization, connectivity, and intelligence in every device, demand continues to grow for leading-edge products from newer process technologies emerging into the embedded market, which contributed to a fivefold increase in lpddr4 bit-shipments to the automotive market in 2019 as compared to 2018. our embedded products enable edge devices to store, connect, and share information in the growing internet of things ("iot") and are utilized in a diverse set of applications in the automotive, industrial, and consumer markets. automotive : our ddr3 dram, e.mmc managed nand, and lpddr4 dram automotive memory and storage products enable connected, large display infotainment systems and higher definition 4k displays and support improved voice and gesture control in automotive applications. advancements in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems continue to increase the requirements for high-performing memory and storage products, with higher reliability requirements for leading-edge products. our comprehensive and expanding portfolio of dram, nand, and nor solutions to the automotive market, as well as our extensive customer support network, enable us to maintain our strong leadership position in this market. in 2019, we introduced our ufs 2.1 managed nand portfolio, based on our reliable automotive-grade 64-layer 3d tlc nand, that features ultrafast boot-up time with up to three times the sequential read-performance of e.mmc-based products. we also introduced the industry's first 1tb tlc nvme automotive ssd. industrial : our industrial products, featuring ddr4 and ddr3 dram, slc nand, nand mcps, and nor, enable applications in the growing industrial iot market, including machine-to-machine communication, factory automation, transportation, surveillance, retail, and smart infrastructure. our authenta technology provides a new level of cyber protection for the lowest layers of iot device software by leveraging existing flash memory sockets to enable iot device health and identity without adding additional hardware components. consumer : our ddr4 and ddr3 dram, lpddr4 dram, and emcp managed nand products sold into the consumer market are used in a diverse set of consumer products, including service provider and ip set-top boxes, digital home assistants, digital still and video cameras, home networking, ultra-high definition televisions, and many more applications. our embedded memory and storage solutions enable edge devices in the consumer products market to store, connect, and share information in the iot. in 2019, we began offering high density 128gb to 1tb microsd card products for the consumer markets, leveraging our most advanced 96-layer 3d qlc nand technology. manufacturing in recent years, we have centralized certain key functions of our operations. these centers of excellence enable us to maximize yield and reduce cycle times by combining front and back-end manufacturing, product engineering, and specific technology development to most effectively transfer and ramp technology while driving efficient manufacturing. in 2019, we completed construction and began operating our new singapore leading-edge 3d nand clean room expansion. our singapore center of excellence enables us to transition to leading-edge technology nodes, which require substantially more clean room space than prior nodes, and maintain existing wafer capacity to meet market demand in our expanding storage business. in 2019, we also completed construction and opened our new taiwan back-end assembly and test facility, which together with our existing taiwan facilities, constitute our taiwan dram center of excellence. the new facility enables us to integrate back-end processes into our manufacturing environment while benefitting from economies of scale. 5 we manufacture our products at our wholly-owned and joint venture facilities located in taiwan, singapore, japan, the united states, china, and malaysia and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. nearly all our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. our dram, nand, 3d xpoint memory, and nor products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage much of our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3d non-volatile layers, nand cell levels, process complexity (including number of mask layers and fabrication steps) and manufacturing yield. other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. we continuously enhance our production processes, increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products. as semiconductor memory technology has matured, the rate of increases in bits per wafer and product density has slowed. in 2019, we achieved bit shipment crossover to the 1xnm process node for dram, significantly increased our production of the 1ynm process node, and commenced volume production of 16gb ddr4 products with 1znm technology. in 2019, we also continued to ramp our 96-layer 3d nand technology and make progress on our 128-layer 3d nand, which uses replacement gate technology, that we expect to ramp in 2020. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize yield-limiting and quality contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and airborne particle defects. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged and unpackaged bare die forms. our packaged products include memory modules, ssds, and managed nand including mcps and emmcs. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain memory modules, ssds, and mcps. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. arrangements with intel imft since 2006, we have owned 51% of imft, a joint venture between us and intel. imft is governed by a board of managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. imft manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. in 2018, imft discontinued production of nand and subsequent to that time manufactured 3d xpoint memory. members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with imft's capacity. in january 2019, we exercised our option to acquire intel's interest in imft. intel has set the closing date to occur on october 31, 2019. in connection with our acquisition, in the first quarter of 2020, we expect to pay intel approximately $1.4 billion for intel's interest in imft as well as imft member debt owed to intel. 6 until we complete our acquisition of intel's noncontrolling interest in imft, the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of imft in proportion to their investment, including member debt financing. any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight -month lag. intel provided member debt financing of $1.01 billion to imft in 2018 and imft repaid $316 million to intel in 2019. as a result, as of august 29, 2019 , current debt included $693 million of imft member debt. r&amp;d arrangements we have had agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel. in 2018, we and intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3d nand. we substantially completed our nand development cost-sharing arrangement with intel in the third quarter of 2019. in 2018, we also announced that we and intel would no longer jointly develop 3d xpoint technology beyond the second generation. we substantially completed this cost-sharing arrangement in the first quarter of 2020. supply chain, materials, and use of third-party service providers our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and also on the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards. in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. we monitor and manage supply-chain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers. certain materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals available primarily from china. trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such materials. although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. in addition, we and/or our suppliers and service providers are, and may continue to be, affected by tariffs, embargoes or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, and responsible sourcing practices, which can limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. marketing and customers we continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. many of our customers require thorough review or qualification of our products. by engaging with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products, we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address their changing needs. collaborating with our customers on their design needs in a changing end market allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers. our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron, crucial, and ballistix brand names and through private labels. we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors, and retailers. our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us, and we make shipments against the orders directly to our customers. our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. in each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total net sales were to our top ten customers. for other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see "part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements certain concentrations." 7 backlog because of volatile industry conditions, customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the time of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products comply with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period. under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba memory corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and, as such, have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors. some governments have provided, and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. in particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china's stated national policy objectives. in addition, the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers. 8 research and development our r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of product and process technology that enables continuous improvement to cost structures and performance enhancements for our future products. we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. additional r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures and the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise. product design and development efforts include high-density ddr4, ddr5, lpddr4, lpddr5, and advanced graphics dram; 3d nand (including 96-layer and 128-layer tlc and qlc technologies); 3d xpoint technology; hbm technology; ssds (including firmware and controllers); managed nand; specialty memory; and other memory technologies and systems. to compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. the continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for memory and storage products and solutions. our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world. our largest r&amp;d center is located in boise, idaho and other product and process development centers are located in japan, china, germany, italy, india, singapore, taiwan, and other sites in the united states. r&amp;d expenses vary with the number of development wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. as a result, r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. we have had agreements to share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements with intel to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies. amounts received from our development partners for reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements are reflected as reductions of r&amp;d expenses. we substantially completed our nand technology cost-sharing arrangement with intel in the third quarter of 2019 and our 3d xpoint arrangement in the first quarter of 2020. patents and licenses we are a recognized leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. as of august 29, 2019 , we owned approximately 13,750 active u.s. patents and 5,500 active foreign patents. in addition, we have thousands of u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2039. from time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investments in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. we have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. employees as of august 29, 2019 , we had approximately 37,000 employees. 9 environmental compliance we approach environmental stewardship and sustainability proactively to ensure we meet all government regulations regarding use of raw materials, discharges, emissions, and wastes from our manufacturing processes. compliance with the law and other compliance obligations is considered a minimum environmental expectation at micron. our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of the international organization for standardization ("iso") 14001 environmental management systems standard to ensure we are continuously improving our performance. as part of the iso 14001 framework, we have established a global environmental policy and meet requirements in terms of environmental aspects evaluation and control, compliance obligations, commitment, training, communication, control of documented information, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental

12 item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors, the order of which is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business. we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices, including dramatic declines as noted in the table below, and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. dram nand (percentage change in average selling prices) 2019 from 2018 (30 )% (44 )% 2018 from 2017 37 % (8 )% 2017 from 2016 19 % (7 )% 2016 from 2015 (35 )% (19 )% 2015 from 2014 (11 )% (15 )% we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins. our gross margins are dependent in part upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, additional 3d memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to maintain or reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, 3d memory layers, nand cell levels, transitioning to replacement gate technology for nand, process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps, manufacturing yield, technological barriers, changes in process technologies, and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes. many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which could lead to underutilization of our production assets. these factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, declining selling prices, and changes in supply agreements. a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. as a result, lower utilization and increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs may adversely affect our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition. in addition, per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio, which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles. our business and the markets we serve are subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences. as a result, we may have work in process or finished goods inventories that could become obsolete or in amounts that are in excess of our customers' demand. as a result, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; toshiba memory corporation; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry 13 competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments have provided, and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. in particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china's stated national policy objectives. in addition, the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers. our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technology, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d, and product and process technology. we estimate that capital expenditures in 2020 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, will be approximately $7 billion to $8 billion, focused on technology transitions and product enablement. investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in 2012, and for so long as such proceedings are continuing, mmj is prohibited from paying dividends, including any cash dividends, to us and such proceedings require that excess earnings be used in mmj's business or to fund the mmj creditor payments. in addition, pursuant to an order of the tokyo district court, mmj cannot make loans or advances, other than certain ordinary course advances, to us without the consent of the tokyo district court and may, under certain circumstances, be subject to approval of the legal trustee. as a result, the assets of mmj are not available for use by us in our other operations. furthermore, certain uses of the assets of mmj, including certain capital expenditures of mmj, may require consent of mmj's trustees and/or the tokyo district court. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. we have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and may continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of future borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. in 2019, we suspended the security interest in the collateral under our credit facility upon achieving specified credit ratings and the prepayment of our 2022 term loan b; however, the security interest would be automatically reinstated upon a decline in our corporate credit rating below a certain level. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures, access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 14 increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes on our or our customers' products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations. in 2019, 89% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states. we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the united states. additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the united states, including in taiwan, singapore, japan, and china. the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. general trade tensions between the u.s. and china have been escalating since 2018, with u.s. tariffs on chinese goods and retaliatory chinese tariffs on u.s. goods. some of our products are included in these tariffs. higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by u.s. and chinese leaders. additionally, the u.s. has threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from other countries, which could also impact certain of our customers' or our operations. if the u.s. were to impose current or additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source, our cost for such components would increase. we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs and supply chain risks due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations. additionally, tariffs on our customers' products could impact their sales of such end products, resulting in lower demand for our products. we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the u.s. and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. u.s. trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to a significant customer and could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers. on may 16, 2019, the bureau of industry and security ("bis") of the u.s. department of commerce added huawei to the bis's entity list, which imposes limitations on the supply of certain u.s. items and product support to huawei. in 2019, our sales to huawei accounted for 12% of our total revenue. to ensure compliance with the entity list restrictions, we suspended shipments of all products to huawei, effective may 16, 2019. we are reviewing our product portfolio to determine whether our products and related support are subject to the export administration regulations, and therefore within the scope of the entity list restrictions. we have determined that certain products huawei purchases from us are not subject to the export administration regulations and consequently can be lawfully sold and shipped to huawei. accordingly, we resumed shipping certain products to huawei in the fourth quarter of 2019. while huawei remains on the entity list, and in the absence of a license from the bis, we may be unable to work with huawei on future product development, which may have a negative effect on our ability to sell products to huawei in the future. entity list restrictions may also encourage huawei to seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to huawei. moreover, although huawei is not prohibited from paying (and we are not restricted from collecting) accounts receivable for products we sell to huawei, the credit risks associated with these accounts may have increased as a result of the bis's actions. we cannot predict what additional actions the u.s. government may take with respect to huawei, including modifications to, or interpretations of, entity list restrictions, export restrictions, tariffs, or other trade limitations or barriers. due to the customized nature of certain of the products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventory to an alternative customer or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods. the entity list trade restrictions enacted during our third quarter of 2019 had an adverse effect on our business. we are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to huawei, whether any licenses will be issued, or the long-term effects on our business. other companies may be added to the entity list and/or subject to trade restrictions. for example, in october 2019, the u.s. government added several additional chinese organizations to the entity list, effective october 9, 2019. in addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify, including that some of our other customer's products which incorporate our solutions may also be impacted by these and other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the u.s., china, or other countries. restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to huawei have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 15 in addition, restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to other organizations added to the entity list may have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies. our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, and improving power consumption and reliability. we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per-unit cost. we have invested and expect to continue to invest in r&amp;d for new and existing products, which involves significant risk and uncertainties. we may be unable to recover our investment in r&amp;d or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. we develop and produce advanced memory technologies, including 3d xpoint memory, a new class of non-volatile technology. there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market new product technologies will be successful. unsuccessful efforts to develop new semiconductor memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers. in each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. in addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold. our inability to meet our customers' requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue. the loss of one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. in 2019, 53% of our revenue was to customers who have headquarters located in the united states. we ship our products to the locations specified by our customers. customers with global supply chains and operations may request we deliver products to countries where they own or operate production facilities or to countries where they utilize third-party subcontractors or warehouses. as a result, 89% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states. in addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states. in particular, a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore, taiwan, japan, and china. many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors operate internationally and are also subject to the risks described below. in addition, the u.s. government has in the past restricted american firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar bans or other restrictions on sales to one or more of our significant customers. these restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. even when such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose while complying with such restrictions. we have experienced restrictions on our ability to sell products to certain foreign customers where sales of products require export licenses or are prohibited by government action. possible future u.s. government actions could lead to additional or enhanced controls on exports from the united states to china or other countries, bans on sales to other key customers, or other similar restrictions. trade-related government actions, by china or other countries, that impose barriers or restrictions that would impact our ability to sell or ship products to huawei or other customers may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. we cannot predict the actions government entities may take in this context and may be unable to quickly offset or 16 effectively react to government actions that restrict our ability to sell to certain customers or in certain jurisdictions. government actions that affect our customers' ability to sell products or access critical elements of their supply chains may result in a decreased demand for their products, which may consequently reduce their demand for our products. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; theft of intellectual property; political and economic instability; government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products, including delays in shipping and obtaining products, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products; problems with the transportation or delivery of products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; disruptions to manufacturing operations as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. if we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging patent infringement. we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging that we infringe certain chinese patents by manufacturing and selling certain products in china. the complaints seek orders requiring us to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in china; to stop manufacturing, using, selling, and offering for sale the accused products in china; and to pay damages plus court fees. we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our operations in china, products, and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii. financial information item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies.") we are subject to allegations of anticompetitive conduct. on april 27, 2018, a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. subsequently, two substantially identical cases were filed in the same court. the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of dram products. the complaints assert claims based on alleged price-fixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1, 2016 to february 1, 2018, and seek treble monetary damages, costs, interest, attorneys' fees, and other injunctive and equitable relief. on september 3, 2019, the district court granted micron's motion to dismiss and allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to file an amended complaint. on june 26, 2018, a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. subsequently, four substantially identical cases were filed in the same court. the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of a nationwide class of direct purchasers of dram products. the complaints assert claims based on alleged price-fixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1, 2016 to february 1, 2018, and seek treble monetary damages, costs, interest, attorneys' fees, and other injunctive and equitable relief. 17 additionally, six cases have been filed in the following canadian courts: superior court of quebec, the federal court of canada, the ontario superior court of justice, and the supreme court of british columbia. the substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in the united states. on may 15, 2018, the chinese state administration for market regulation ("samr") notified micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by dram suppliers in china. on may 31, 2018, samr made unannounced visits to our sales offices in beijing, shanghai, and shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. we are cooperating with samr in its investigation. we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of these matters could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment, or the dependency on third-party service providers. our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. certain materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals available primarily from china. trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such materials. although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. if china were to stop exporting these materials, our suppliers' ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china. we and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs, embargoes or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, and responsible sourcing practices, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. lead times for the supply of materials have been extended in the past. the disruption of our supply of materials, components, services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers' limited capacity. our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. new product and market development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product and system-level solution development over the next several years. additionally, we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customer's ability to accurately forecast the 18 end-customer's needs and preferences. as a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. for certain of our markets, it is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. if we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may excluded us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. in addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand. such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. there can be no assurance of the following: that our product development efforts will be successful; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these products; that we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements; that we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis; or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions. our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers' specifications for those products. developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products in sufficient volume, quantity, and in a timely manner. if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis, or at all, that comply with our customers' specifications or achieve design wins with our customers, we may experience a significant adverse impact on our revenues and margins. even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. our competitors' products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers' ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. if we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs exceed our per-unit selling prices. manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. additionally, some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. additionally, we may need to update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. system complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functions in our customers' products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for 19 costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers' products failing to perform as specified. we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our relationships with existing or potential customers. any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including u.s. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do u.s. laws and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense. due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results, a decline in our operating results and/or stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent, in part, upon the market price of our common stock, achieving certain performance metrics, levels of company profitability, or other financial or company-wide performance. if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment. our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management's time and attention. as a result of these claims, we may be required to: pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. we may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see "part ii. financial information item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies.") we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are 20 unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. the failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. any claim, with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results, disrupt our operations, and require significant attention from our management. we could be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising from our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners. we may also be associated with and subject to litigation arising from the actions of our subcontractors or business partners. we may also be subject to litigation as a result of indemnities we issue, primarily with our customers, the terms of our product warranties, and from product liability claims. as we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers' use of those products. there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. exposures to various litigation could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we are subject to allegations of securities violations and related wrongful acts. on march 5, 2019, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware, allegedly on behalf of and for the benefit of micron, against certain current and former officers and directors of micron for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties and other violations of law. the allegations are based on, among other things, purported false and misleading statements regarding anticompetitive behavior in the dram industry. the complaint seeks damages, fees, interest, costs, and other appropriate relief. similar shareholder derivative complaints have subsequently been filed in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware and the u.s. district court for the district of idaho. we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of these matters could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states, singapore, taiwan, japan, malaysia, and china. additionally, until we complete our acquisition of intel's noncontrolling interest in imft, our control over operations at imft is limited by our agreements with intel. from time to time, there have been disruptions in the manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events, including earthquakes or tsunamis, that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. if production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenues, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business. adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products, such as personal computers, mobile devices, ssds, and servers. reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions 21 may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. as a result, a downturn in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. breaches of our security systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses. we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. in addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems, or breaches or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised. the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks. we have entered into strategic relationships to develop new manufacturing process technologies and products and to manufacture certain products, including our joint development partnership and our imft joint venture with intel. in january 2019, we exercised our option to acquire intel's interest in imft. subsequently, intel set the closing date to occur on october 31, 2019. in the first quarter of 2020, we expect to pay intel approximately $1.4 billion in cash for intel's noncontrolling interest in imft and imft member debt. as of august 29, 2019, current debt included $693 million of imft member debt. our joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations, including the following: diverging interests between us and our partners and disagreements on the following: ongoing or future development, manufacturing, or operational activities; the amount, timing, or nature of further investments; and commercial terms in our joint ventures or strategic relationships; competition from our partners; access by our partners to our proprietary product and process technology which they may use; difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures; difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures; limited control over the operations of our joint ventures; inability of our partners to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures; differences in participation on funding capital investments in our joint ventures due to differing business models or long-term business goals; inadequate cash flows to fund increased capital requirements of our joint ventures; difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners; disputes with partners regarding the terms of arrangements, including the termination or discontinuance of our joint ventures, or that terms of such arrangements are unfavorable; and changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements that necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners. our pending acquisition of intel's noncontrolling interest in imft may involve additional risks, including, but not limited to, an inability to sell the product imft produces, increases in underutilization charges, increase in r&amp;d expenses, retention of key employees, and successful integration of imft. our joint ventures and strategic relationships, if unsuccessful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. we have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructuring of our capital structure. as of august 29, 2019 , we had debt with a carrying value of $5.85 billion . as of august 29, 2019 , we also had an undrawn credit facility totaling $3.75 billion consisting of (1) an undrawn revolving credit facility that matures in july 2023 and provides for borrowings of up to $2.50 billion and (2) a term loan facility 22 for up to $1.25 billion available to be drawn in a single advance prior to november 9, 2019. as of august 29, 2019 , the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes was $654 million , based on the trading price of our common stock of $44.67 per share on such date. our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; require us to use cash and/or issue shares of our common stock to settle any conversion obligations of our convertible notes; result in certain of our debt instruments being accelerated to be immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if certain terms of default are triggered, such as applicable cross payment default and/or cross-acceleration provisions; adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, r&amp;d, and other general corporate requirements; restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory and storage industry conditions; increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness; continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; and require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility. in 2019, we suspended the security interest in the collateral under our credit facility upon achieving a specified credit rating and prepaying the 2022 term loan b; however, if our corporate credit rating were to decline below a certain level, the security interest would be automatically reinstated. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. to remain competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other highly skilled employees. competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense and hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives are critical to our business. our inability to attract and retain key employees may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations. additionally, changes to immigration policies in the numerous countries in which we operate, including the united states, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in specific locations. if our total compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. on january 20, 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda's insolvency proceedings, filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor b.v. ("micron b.v."), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void, under section 133 of the german insolvency act, a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in fall 2008, pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera (the "inotera shares"), representing approximately 18% of inotera's outstanding shares as of august 29, 2019 , and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the qimonda estate. the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged 23 value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate, under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code, a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. following a series of hearings with pleadings, arguments, and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate, on march 13, 2014, the court issued judgments: (1) ordering micron b.v. to pay approximately $1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase; (2) ordering micron b.v. to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties; (3) ordering micron b.v. to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares, including in particular, any profits distributed on the inotera shares and all other benefits; (4) denying qimonda's claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera; and (5) determining that qimonda's obligations under the patent cross-license agreement are canceled. in addition, the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering, among other things: (1) that micron b.v. transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by micron b.v. and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties; and (2) that micron b.v. pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by micron b.v. from ownership of the inotera shares. the interlocutory judgments have no immediate, enforceable effect on us, and, accordingly, we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case. on april 17, 2014, micron and micron b.v. filed a notice of appeal with the german appeals court challenging the district court's decision. after opening briefs, the appeals court held a hearing on the matter on july 9, 2015, and thereafter appointed two independent experts to perform an evaluation of dr. jaff 's claims that the amount micron paid for qimonda was less than fair market value. on january 25, 2018, the court-appointed experts issued their report concluding that the amount paid by micron was within an acceptable fair-value range. the appeals court held a subsequent hearing on april 30, 2019, and on may 28, 2019, the appeals court remanded the case to the experts for supplemental expert opinion. we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and, therefore, cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we operate in a number of locations outside the united states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, and changes in tax laws and regulations. additionally, we file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world and certain tax returns may remain open to examination for several years. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense. we are subject to income taxes in the u.s. and many foreign jurisdictions. changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. for example, our effective tax rate increased from 1.2% for 2018 to 9.8% for 2019 primarily as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22, 2017 by the united states. the u.s. treasury department continues to issue interpretive guidance on the tax act, including foreign tax credits, foreign minimum tax, foreign derived intangible income, and interest expense deduction limitations. it is anticipated that the guidance will be finalized over the next several months. additionally, various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative actions to increase tax revenue. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic co-operation and development, which represents a coalition of member countries and recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. if adopted by countries, such changes, as well as changes in u.s. federal and state tax laws or in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 24 our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback. we have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production in those regions. these incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to perform or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives. we cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding. these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our performance with the terms and obligations. such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; diverting management's attention from daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. in previous years, supply of memory and storage products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices. the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. we engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, and yen. although we hedge our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities, the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar, particularly the yen, have been volatile in recent periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. exchange rates for the u.s. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 25 we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods. from time to time, we have, and may in the future, enter into restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. in connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. compliance with customer and responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services used in manufacturing our products. many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to periodically report on our supply chain and responsible sourcing efforts to ensure we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell in a manner that is consistent with their programs. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products meet the specifications of their responsible sourcing programs. meeting customer requirements may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. this in turn may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities. this increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and its implementing sec regulations. the act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo and finance or benefit local armed groups. these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. our inability to comply with customers' requirements for responsible sourcing or with regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we and others are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities. the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. additionally, we engage various third parties to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf and we partner with other companies in our joint ventures, all of whom are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations. our engagement with these third parties and our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations. as a result of these items, we could experience the following: suspension of production; remediation costs; alteration of our manufacturing processes; regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; and reputational challenges. our failure, or the failure of our third-party agents or joint ventures, to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, capped call contracts on our common stock, and derivative instruments. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may 26 not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the operations of mmj are subject to continued oversight by the tokyo district court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings. because mmj's plan of reorganization provides for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition, the reorganization proceedings in japan (the "japan proceedings") are continuing and mmj remains subject to the oversight of the tokyo district court and of the trustees (including a trustee designated by us, who we refer to as the business trustee, and a trustee designated by the tokyo district court, who we refer to as the legal trustee), pending completion of the reorganization proceedings. the business trustee is responsible for overseeing the operation of the business of the mmj companies, other than oversight in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings, which are the responsibility of the legal trustee. the final creditor payment under mmj's plan of reorganization is scheduled to occur in december 2019. following distribution of the final payment and the tokyo district court's approval and issuance of an order concluding the reorganization proceedings, mmj's reorganization proceedings in japan and oversight of the tokyo district court will terminate. during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan, mmj is obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the tokyo district court and may be required to obtain the consent of the tokyo district court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to its businesses, including transferring or disposing of, or acquiring, certain material assets, incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness, settling material disputes, or entering into certain material agreements. the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of mmj or for transfers of material assets, to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of mmj's plan of reorganization. accordingly, during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan, our ability to operate mmj as part of our global business or to cause mmj to take certain actions that we deem advisable for its business could be adversely affected if the tokyo district court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to mmj. the operations of mmj being subject to the continued oversight by the tokyo district court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. as of august 29, 2019 and august 30, 2018 , we had fixed-rate debt of $5.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, and as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of august 29, 2019 and august 30, 2018 , a decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $290 million and $79 million, respectively. as of august 29, 2019 , we had no variable-rate debt. as of august 30, 2018 , we had variable-rate debt of $725 million. as of august 30, 2018 , a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $7 million. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in "part i item 1a. risk factors." changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our debt, operating expenditures, and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, new taiwan dollar, singapore dollar, and yen. we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $149 million as of august 29, 2019 and $78 million as of august 30, 2018 . we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three months. the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent, among other factors, upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities. to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures, we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months.

malaysia and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. our dram, nand, 3d xpoint memory, and nor products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3d non-volatile layers, nand cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps), and manufacturing yield. other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to 7 | 2020 10-k perform certain manufacturing processes. as we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions, manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of asic controllers, advanced and complex packaging configurations, and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels. we continuously enhance our production processes, increase bits per wafer, transition to higher density products, and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and contamination from airborne particles. success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. we continue to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higher-end segments that require increasing performance targets. our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die. our packaged products include packaged die, memory modules, and system-level solutions, such as ssds, managed nand, and mcps. we assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain packaged die, memory modules, ssds, and mcps. we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. in addition, we use our proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. in recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. arrangements with intel since 2006, we and intel owned and operated imft, a joint venture that manufactured semiconductor products exclusively for its members under long-term supply agreements at prices approximating cost. through 2018, imft manufactured nand memory and, subsequent to that time, manufactured 3d xpoint memory. in the first quarter of 2020, we acquired intel's interest in imft. (see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements equity, debt, and research and development. ) supply chain, materials, and third-party service providers our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. we monitor and manage supply-chain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers. certain materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals available primarily from china. trade disputes or other political conditions, economic conditions, or public health issues, such as covid-19, may limit our ability to obtain such materials. although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, china is the 8 predominant producer of certain of these materials. in addition, we and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, or contagious disease outbreaks, which can limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. marketing and customers we continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. many of our customers require thorough review or qualification of our products. by engaging with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products, we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address our customers' changing needs. collaborating with our customers on their design needs in changing end markets allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers. our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron and crucial brand names and through private labels. we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. we sell our crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. our products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors, and retailers. our independent sales representatives obtain orders, subject to final acceptance by us, and we then make shipments against these orders directly to customers or through our distributors. our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. in each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total net sales were to our top ten customers. for other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements certain concentrations. sales of our memory and storage products, and the transfer of related technical information and know-how, including support, are subject to laws and regulations governing international trade, including, but not limited to, export control, customs, and sanctions regulations administered by u.s. government agencies such as the bureau of industry and security ( bis ) of the u.s. department of commerce and the office of foreign asset control of the u.s. department of the treasury. other jurisdictions, such as the european union or china, also maintain, or may implement, similar laws and regulations with which we must comply. any such laws or regulations may require that we either obtain licenses or other authorizations to export certain of our products or sell them to certain countries, companies, or individuals, or, in the absence of such licenses or authorizations, not export or sell the applicable products or transfer the related technical information and know-how to the affected countries, companies, or individuals. in addition, increased tariffs imposed by the countries in which our products are sold can increase the cost of our product to our customers. the laws and regulations that govern international trade change frequently, sometimes without advance notice. see item 1a. risk factors trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to several customers, could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers or in certain markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations and we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. backlog because of volatile industry conditions, our customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly. we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the time of shipment. for these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. 9 | 2020 10-k product warranty the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex and, as a result, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products comply with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period. under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. competition we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; kioxia holdings corporation (formerly toshiba memory corporation); samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and, as such, have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. for these products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factor. in addition, some of our competitors may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies or may not be subject to certain regulations or restrictions to which we are subject, which may allow them access to certain sales opportunities from which we may be restricted. some governments may provide, or have provided, and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. in particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china's stated national policy objectives. in addition, the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers. additionally, our customers may redirect their business to our competitors based on government policy, national preference, or other factors. research and development our r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of industry leading memory and storage solutions that enable continuous improvement in performance and cost structure for our products. we are focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. additional r&amp;d efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures and the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise. product design and development efforts include high-density ddr4, ddr5, lpddr4, lpddr5, high-bandwidth memory, and advanced graphics dram; 3d nand (including tlc and qlc technologies); 3d xpoint technology; mobile and storage solutions (including firmware and controllers); managed nand; and other memory technologies and systems. to compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. the continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for memory and storage products and solutions. our process, design, firmware, controller, package, and system development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world. our primary r&amp;d centers are located in boise, idaho, singapore, japan, taiwan, italy, china, india, germany, and other sites in the united states. r&amp;d expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. patents and licenses as of september 3, 2020, we owned approximately 14,200 active u.s. patents and 6,500 active foreign patents. in addition, we have thousands of u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. our patents have various terms expiring through 2040. from time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investments in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. we have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. employees as of september 3, 2020, we had approximately 40,000 employees. 11 | 2020 10-k environmental compliance we approach environmental stewardship and sustainability proactively to ensure we meet all government regulations regarding use of raw materials, discharges, climate change and energy use, emissions, and wastes from our manufacturing processes and address the evolving expectations of our investors, customers, team members, and other stakeholders. compliance with the law and other compliance obligations is considered a minimum environmental expectation at micron. our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of the international organization for standardization ( iso ) 14001 environmental management systems standard to ensure we are continuously improving our performance. as part of the iso 14001 framework, we have established a global environmental policy and meet requirements in terms of environmental aspects evaluation and control, compliance obligations, commitment, training, communication, control of documented information, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, and management review. while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions. information about our executive officers our executive officers are

our filings are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the sec, including our annual and quarterly reports on forms 10-k and 10-q and current reports on form 8-k, our proxy statements, and any amendments to those reports or statements. the sec's website, www.sec.gov, contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec. the content on any website referred to in this form 10-k is not incorporated by reference in this form 10-k unless expressly noted. item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors, the order of which is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us. any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant. the effects of the covid-19 outbreak could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. the effects of the public health crisis caused by the covid-19 outbreak and the measures being taken to limit covid-19's spread are uncertain and difficult to predict, but may include, and in some cases, have included and may continue to include: a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand and/or pricing for our products and a global economic recession or depression that could further reduce demand and/or pricing for our products, resulting from actions taken by governments, businesses, and/or the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and the spreading of covid-19, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, and business shutdowns or slowdowns; negative impacts to our operations, including: reductions in production levels, r&amp;d activities, product development, technology transitions, yield enhancement activities, and qualification activities with our customers, resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of covid-19 through physical-distancing measures we have enacted at our locations around the world in an effort to protect our employees' and contractors' health and well-being, including working from home, limiting the number of meeting attendees, reducing the number of people in certain of our sites at any one time, quarantines of team members, contractors, or vendors who are at risk of contracting, or have contracted, covid-19, and limiting employee travel; increased costs resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of covid-19 through physical distancing measures, working from home, upgrades to our sites, enhanced cleaning measures, and the increased use of personal protective equipment at our sites; 14 increased costs for, or unavailability of, transportation, raw materials, or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business; reductions in or cessation of operations at any site or in any jurisdiction resulting from government restrictions on movement and/or business operations or our failure to prevent and/or adequately mitigate spread of covid-19 at one or more of our sites; our inability to continue or resume construction projects due to delays in obtaining materials, equipment, labor, engineering services, government permits, or any other essential aspect of projects, which could impact our ability to introduce new technologies, reduce costs, or meet customer demand; disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing and transportation of materials, equipment and engineering support, and services from or in geographic areas that have been impacted by covid-19 and by efforts to contain the spread of covid-19; and deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures, result in losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties, and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults. the resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of covid-19 on our team members, contractors, suppliers, third-party service providers, customers, or distributors. these effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, legal exposure, or financial condition. a sustained, prolonged, or recurring outbreak could exacerbate the adverse impact of such measures. volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business. we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices, including dramatic declines as noted in the table below, and may continue to experience such volatility in the future. in some prior periods, average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future. average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. dram nand (percentage change in average selling prices) 2020 from 2019 (34) % (9) % 2019 from 2018 (30) % (47) % 2018 from 2017 36 % (13) % 2017 from 2016 18 % (10) % 2016 from 2015 (34) % (16) % beginning in 2020, revenue and units for mcps and ssds, which contain both dram and nand, are disaggregated based on the relative values of each component. prior periods presented in the table above have been conformed to current period presentation. we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins. our gross margins are dependent, in part, upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs, including, but not limited to, process line-width, additional 3d memory layers, additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), architecture, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and yield. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins. factors that may limit our ability to maintain or reduce costs include, but are not limited to, strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, difficulties in transitioning to smaller line-width process technologies, 3d memory layers, nand cell levels, transitioning to replacement gate technology for nand, process 15 | 2020 10-k complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps, manufacturing yield, technological barriers, changes in process technologies, and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes. many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production, which could lead to underutilization of our production assets. these factors may include, among others, a weak demand environment, industry oversupply, inventory surpluses, our ramp of emerging technologies, declining selling prices, and changes in supply agreements. a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output. as a result, lower utilization and increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs may adversely affect our gross margins, business, results of operations, or financial condition. in addition, per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio, which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles. our business and the markets we serve are subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences. as a result, we may have work in process or finished goods inventories that could become obsolete or in amounts that are in excess of our customers' demand. as a result, we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. in addition, due to the customized nature of certain of the products we manufacture, we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture in-process inventory to different specifications, which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods. our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including intel; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sk hynix inc.; kioxia holdings corporation (formerly toshiba memory corporation); and western digital corporation. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. in addition, some governments may provide, or have provided and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. in particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china's stated national policy objectives. in addition, the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers. our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations, make scheduled debt payments, and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold, average selling prices, and manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technology, support 16 future growth, achieve operating efficiencies, and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, capital equipment, facilities, r&amp;d, and product and process technology. we estimate capital expenditures in 2021 for property, plant, and equipment, net of partner contributions, will be approximately $9 billion, focused on technology transitions and product enablement. investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows. delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed. as a result of our debt levels, expected debt amortization, and general economic conditions, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. we have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and may continue to experience such volatility in the future, which may negatively affect our credit rating. our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk, or other factors, which may increase the cost of future borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. in addition, if our credit rating declines below a certain level, our credit facility will be required to become secured by certain of our assets, which may limit the amount or increase the cost of future financings. there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows, access capital or credit markets, or find other sources of financing to fund our operations, make debt payments, and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency. our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business. the health crisis caused by covid-19 has adversely affected economic conditions and caused a downturn in the worldwide economy. downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and the current downturn has adversely affected our business. as a result, demand for certain of our products used in smartphones, consumer electronics, and automotive, has declined. reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales. if these adverse conditions persist or worsen, we could experience additional reduction in demand for our products and/or devices that incorporate our products. future downturns could also adversely affect our business. in addition, to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels, we may experience a decrease in short-term and/or long-term demand and/or pricing for our products. a deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures. in addition, we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties. difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults. as a result, downturns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes on our or our customers' products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations. in 2020, 88% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states. we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the united states. additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the united states, including in taiwan, singapore, japan, and china. the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods. general trade tensions between the united states and china have been escalating since 2018, with u.s. tariffs on chinese goods and retaliatory chinese tariffs on u.s. goods. some of our products are included in these tariffs. higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by u.s. and chinese leaders. additionally, the united states has threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from other countries, which could also impact certain of our customers' or our operations. if the united states were to impose current or additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source, our cost for such components would increase. we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs and supply chain risks due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations. additionally, tariffs on our customers' products could impact their sales of such end products, resulting in lower demand for our products. 17 | 2020 10-k we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation. further changes in trade policy, tariffs, additional taxes, restrictions on exports or other trade barriers, or restrictions on supplies, equipment, and raw materials including rare earth minerals, may limit our ability to produce products, increase our selling and/or manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to several customers, could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers or in certain markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. international trade disputes have led, and may continue to lead, to new and increasing trade barriers and other protectionist measures that can increase our manufacturing costs, make our products less competitive, reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets, limit our ability to procure components or raw materials, impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders, impede our ability to perform r&amp;d activities, or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations. increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy, domestic sourcing initiatives, or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in, or restrict our access to, some markets and/or customers. escalating trade tensions between the united states and china have led to increased trade restrictions, and have affected customer ordering patterns. for example, over the last 18 months the bis has enacted increasingly broad trade restrictions with respect to huawei (which represented approximately 10% of our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 12% in 2019), culminating with restrictions that took effect on september 15, 2020 and that currently prevent us and many other companies from shipping products to huawei. we cannot predict the duration these restrictions will remain in place, whether the bis will grant us or others licenses to ship products to huawei, or whether the bis or other u.s. or foreign government entities will enact similar restrictions with respect to other customers, markets, or products. we may not be able to replace the lost revenue opportunities associated with such restrictions. the united states has also imposed other restrictions on the export of u.s. regulated products and technology to certain chinese technology companies, including certain of our customers. these restrictions have reduced our sales, and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial results, result in reputational harm to us due to our relationship with such companies, or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products. it is difficult to predict what further trade-related actions governments may take, and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions. for example, u.s. legislation has expanded the power of the u.s. department of commerce to restrict the export of emerging and foundational technologies yet to be identified, which could impact our current or future products. trade disputes and protectionist measures, or continued uncertainty about such matters, could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession, and could cause our customers to reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us. sustained trade tensions could lead to long-term changes in global trade and technology supply chains, which could adversely affect our business and growth prospects. trade restrictions that may be imposed by the united states, china, or other countries may impact our business in ways we cannot reasonably quantify, including that some of our customers' products which incorporate our solutions may also be impacted. restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to huawei have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. in addition, further increases in trade restrictions or barriers may negatively impact our revenue with huawei or other customers, and any licenses we have received or could receive in the future could be rendered ineffective. any such changes may have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. violations of trade laws, restrictions, or regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us or our officers, directors, or employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. the technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties. 18 our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies. our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet long-term customer needs. these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers, increasing bits per cell (i.e., cell levels), meeting higher density requirements, and improving power consumption and reliability. we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate, which has generally reduced per-unit cost. we have invested and expect to continue to invest in r&amp;d for new and existing products, which involves significant risk and uncertainties. we may be unable to recover our investment in r&amp;d or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities. our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and/or cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete. accordingly, our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies. there can be no assurance of the following: that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies; that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; that we will be able to successfully market these technologies; and that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. we develop and produce advanced memory technologies, including 3d xpoint memory, a new class of non-volatile technology. there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market new product technologies will be successful. unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers. in each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business. we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve. in addition, any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold. our inability to meet our customers' requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue. meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers, particularly those in china, could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook. the loss of, or restrictions on our ability to sell to, one or more of our major customers, such as those relating to huawei described above, or any significant reduction in orders from, or a shift in product mix by, customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. in 2020, 52% of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the united states. we ship our products to the locations specified by our customers. customers with global supply chains and operations may request we deliver products to countries where they own or operate production facilities or to countries where they utilize third-party subcontractors or warehouses. as a result, 88% of our revenue in 2020 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states. a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in taiwan, singapore, japan, and china, and many of our customers, suppliers, and vendors also operate internationally. our operations, and the global supply chain of the technology industry, are subject to a number of risks, including the effects of actions and policies of various governments across our global operations and supply chain. for example, political, economic, or other actions from china could impact taiwan and its economy, and may adversely affect our operations in taiwan, our customers, and the technology industry supply chain. in addition, the u.s. government has in the past restricted american firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar bans or other restrictions on sales to one or more of our significant customers. these restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers, which may result in our loss of sales and market share. even when such restrictions are lifted, financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our 19 | 2020 10-k customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations, and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose while complying with such restrictions. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, customs regulations and processes, and restrictions on the transfer of funds; imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as covid-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome ( sars-cov ), avian and swine influenza, measles, or ebola); compliance with u.s. and international laws involving international operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977, as amended, export and import laws, and similar rules and regulations; theft of intellectual property; political and economic instability, including the effects of disputes between china and taiwan; government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products, including delays in shipping and obtaining products, cancellation of orders, or loss or damage of products; problems with the transportation or delivery of products; issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest; longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; compliance with trade, technical standards, and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions; contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels; disruptions to manufacturing or r&amp;d activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments; changes in economic policies of foreign governments; and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations. if we or our customers, suppliers, or vendors are impacted by these risks, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging patent infringement. we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging that we infringe certain chinese patents by manufacturing and selling certain products in china. the complaints seek orders requiring us to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in china; to stop manufacturing, using, selling, and offering for sale the accused products in china; and to pay damages plus court fees. we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our operations in china, products, and/or manufacturing processes. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies. ) we are subject to allegations of anticompetitive conduct. on april 27, 2018, a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. subsequently, two substantially identical cases were filed in the same court. the lawsuits purported to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of dram products. on september 3, 2019, the district court granted micron's motion to dismiss and allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to file a consolidated, amended complaint. on october 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of dram products. the amended complaint asserts claims based on alleged price-fixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1, 2016 to at least february 1, 2018, and seeks treble monetary damages, costs, interest, attorneys' fees, and other injunctive and equitable relief. on june 26, 2018, a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california. subsequently, four substantially identical cases were filed in the same court. on october 28, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated, amended complaint. the consolidated complaint purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class of direct purchasers of dram products. the consolidated complaint asserts claims 20 based on alleged price-fixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1, 2016 through at least february 1, 2018, and seeks treble monetary damages, costs, interest, attorneys' fees, and other injunctive and equitable relief. additionally, six cases have been filed in the following canadian courts: superior court of quebec, the federal court of canada, the ontario superior court of justice, and the supreme court of british columbia. the substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in the united states. on may 15, 2018, the chinese state administration for market regulation ( samr ) notified micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by dram suppliers in china. on may 31, 2018, samr made unannounced visits to our sales offices in beijing, shanghai, and shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation. we are cooperating with samr in its investigation. we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of these matters could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials, supplies, and capital equipment, or the dependency on third-party service providers. our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. certain materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals available primarily from china. trade disputes or other political conditions, economic conditions, or public health issues, such as covid-19, may limit our ability to obtain such materials. although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. if china were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers' ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china. we and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, contagious disease outbreaks, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. lead times for the supply of materials have been extended in the past. our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. the disruption of our supply of materials, components, services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes. for certain key types of equipment, including photolithography tools, we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier. from time to time, we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers' limited capacity. our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs. delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at 21 | 2020 10-k new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp. our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. new product and market development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products, including system-level memory and storage products and solutions, which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product and system-level solution development over the next several years. additionally, we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers, which increases our reliance on our customers' ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers. as a result, our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers. for certain of our markets, it is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products. if we do not meet their product design schedules, our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products. the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, often well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. the effects of the public health crisis caused by the covid-19 outbreak and the measures being taken to limit covid-19's spread could negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines and/or expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products. in addition, some of our components have long lead-times, requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand. such long lead-times increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand. there can be no assurance that: our product development efforts will be successful; we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture new products; we will be able to successfully market these products; we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers, or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers, for specific chip set or design requirements; we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis; or margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts. our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions. our development of system-level memory and storage products is dependent, in part, upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers' specifications for those products. developing and manufacturing system-level products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis, or at all, that comply with our customers' specifications or achieve design wins with our customers, we may experience a significant adverse impact on our revenue and margins. even if our products meet customer specifications, our sales of system-level solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices. our competitors' products may be less costly, provide better performance, or include additional features when compared to our products. our long-term ability to sell system-level memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers' ability to create, market, and sell their products containing our system-level solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner. if we fail to successfully develop and market system-level products, our business, results of operations, or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. even if we are successful in selling system-level solutions to our customers in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our per-unit manufacturing costs exceed our per-unit selling prices. manufacturing system-level solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle, as compared to discrete products, to design, test, and qualify, which may increase our costs. additionally, some of our system solutions are 22 increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications, which increases our costs and time to market. additionally, we may need to update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications and/or industry standards, which increases our costs. system complexities and extended warranties for system-level products could also increase our warranty costs. our failure to cost-effectively manufacture system-level solutions and/or firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our system-level products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. products that fail to meet specifications, are defective, or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us. products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time, we experience problems with nonconforming, defective, or incompatible products after we have shipped such products. in recent periods, we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings, which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application. our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers' products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers' products failing to perform as specified. in addition, if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers' products or are used in high-risk consumer end products, such as autonomous driver assistance programs, home and enterprise security, smoke and noxious gas detectors, medical monitoring equipment, or wearables for child and elderly safety, our potential liability may increase. we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products; we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages; and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers. any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property. we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property, including u.s. and foreign patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licensing arrangements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with employees, consultants, and vendors, and a general system of internal controls. despite our system of controls over our intellectual property, it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain, copy, use, or disclose, illegally or otherwise, our product and process technology or other proprietary information. the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do u.s. laws and our confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-compete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce. additionally, our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense. due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results, a decline in our operating results and/or stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent, in part, upon the market price of our common stock, achieving certain performance metrics, levels of company profitability, or other financial or company-wide performance. if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees, they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment. our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 23 | 2020 10-k claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon, misappropriate, misuse, or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us. any of these types of claims, regardless of the merits, could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management's time and attention. as a result of these claims, we may be required to: pay significant monetary damages, fines, royalties, or penalties; enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights; make material changes to or redesign our products and/or manufacturing processes; and/or cease manufacturing, having made, selling, offering for sale, importing, marketing, or using products and/or manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions. we may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. (see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies. ) we have a number of intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us. the failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise, both domestically and internationally. see item 3. legal proceedings. any claim, with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results, disrupt our operations, and require significant attention from our management. we could be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising from our relationships with vendors or customers, supply agreements, or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners. we may also be associated with and subject to litigation arising from the actions of our vendors, subcontractors, or business partners. we may also be subject to litigation or claims as a result of our indemnification obligations, including obligations to defend our customers against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets. we may also be subject to claims or litigation arising from the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims. as we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products, including autonomous driving, augmented reality, and others, we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers' use of those products. we, our officers, or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws. there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. exposures to various legal proceedings and claims could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims, are required to pay damage awards, or enter into settlement agreements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. if our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues, natural disasters, or other events, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs. we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously 24 implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities, which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states, singapore, taiwan, japan, malaysia, and china. from time to time, there have been disruptions in the manufacturing process as a result of power outages, improperly functioning equipment, disruptions in supply of raw materials or components, or equipment failures. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events, including earthquakes or tsunamis, that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. additionally, other events including political or public health crises, such as an outbreak of contagious diseases like covid-19, sars-cov, avian and swine influenza, measles, or ebola, may affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines, closures of production facilities, lack of supplies, or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping. for example, in march 2020, the government of malaysia announced measures to restrict movement in that country in an effort to suppress the number of covid-19 cases. those restrictions temporarily limited our ability to fully operate our manufacturing facilities in that country. the events noted above have occurred from time to time in the past and may occur in the future. as a result, in addition to disruptions to operations, our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance. if production is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected, or we may be unable to meet our customers' requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs, loss of revenue, or damage to customer relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. breaches of our security systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, or business partners, could expose us to losses. we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities. we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. in addition, we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees, including sensitive personal information. unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems, or breaches or attacks on our customers, suppliers, or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers, could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, or employees is compromised. the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we face risks associated with our former imft joint venture with intel. on october 31, 2019, we purchased intel's noncontrolling interest in the imft joint venture, now known as mtu. our acquisition involves risks including, but not limited to, continued underutilization of the mtu facility. we also face risks from our arbitration proceeding with intel, in which we and intel have made claims against each other for damages relating to the joint venture. for information regarding the arbitration proceeding, see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies. the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition. we have incurred in the past, and expect to incur in the future, debt to finance our capital investments, business acquisitions, and restructure of our capital structure. as of september 3, 2020, we had debt with a carrying value of $6.64 billion. as of september 3, 2020, $2.50 billion of our revolving credit facility was available to us. as of september 3, 2020, the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes was $486 million, based on the trading price of our common stock of $46.33 per share on such date. 25 | 2020 10-k our debt obligations could adversely impact us. for example, these obligations could: require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt, which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; require us to use cash and/or issue shares of our common stock to settle any conversion obligations of our convertible notes; result in certain of our debt instruments being accelerated to be immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if certain terms of default are triggered, such as applicable cross payment default and/or cross-acceleration provisions; adversely impact our credit rating, which could increase future borrowing costs; limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, r&amp;d, and other general corporate requirements; restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness, create or incur certain liens, and enter into sale-leaseback financing transactions; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory and storage industry conditions; increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness; continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes; and require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share. our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future. this, to some extent, is subject to market, economic, financial, competitive, legislative, and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. additionally, events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility. in 2019, we suspended the security interest in the collateral under our credit facility upon achieving a specified credit rating and prepaying our senior secured term loan b due in 2022; however, if our corporate credit rating were to decline below a certain level, the security interest would be automatically reinstated, which may limit the amount or increase the cost of future financings. if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we must attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees. to remain competitive, we must attract, retain, and motivate executives and other highly skilled employees, as well as effectively manage or plan for succession for key employees. competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense. hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, technical staff, and sales representatives is critical to our business. our inability to attract, retain, or effectively manage or plan for succession of key employees may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations. additionally, changes to immigration policies in the numerous countries in which we operate, including the united states, as well as restrictions on global travel as a result of local or global public health crises requiring quarantines or other precautions to limit exposure to infectious diseases, may limit our ability to hire and/or retain talent in, or transfer talent to, specific locations. if our total compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could be weakened, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda. in january 2011, dr. michael jaff , administrator for qimonda's insolvency proceedings, filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor b.v. ( micron b.v. ), in the district court of munich, civil chamber. the complaint seeks to void a share purchase agreement between micron b.v. and qimonda signed in 2008, pursuant to which micron b.v. purchased substantially all of qimonda's shares of inotera, representing approximately 18% of inotera's outstanding shares at that time, and seeks an order requiring us to re-transfer those shares to the qimonda estate. 26 the complaint also seeks, among other things, to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate a patent cross-license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement. see part ii item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements contingencies for further information regarding the matter. we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and, therefore, cannot estimate the range of possible loss. the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages, unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron b.v. from the ownership of the inotera shares, and/or the termination of the patent cross-license, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure. we operate in a number of locations outside the united states, including singapore, where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional, in part, upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds. our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions. our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements, failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements, expanding our operations in various countries, and changes in tax laws and regulations. additionally, we file income tax returns with the u.s. federal government, various u.s. states, and various other jurisdictions throughout the world and certain tax returns may remain open to examination for several years. the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. a change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions. changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, or in the interpretation of such laws, could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. for example, our effective tax rate increased from 1.2% for 2018 to 9.8% for 2019 primarily as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 by the united states. additionally, various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative actions to increase tax revenue. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development, which represents a coalition of member countries and recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. if implemented by taxing authorities, such changes, as well as changes in u.s. federal and state tax laws or in taxing jurisdictions' administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction, termination, or clawback. we have received, and may in the future continue to receive, benefits and incentives from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production in those regions. these incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax arrangements, and typically require us to perform or maintain certain levels of investment, capital spending, employment, technology deployment, or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives. we cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding. these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our performance with their terms and obligations. such audits could result in modifications to, or termination of, the applicable incentive program. the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback, and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 27 | 2020 10-k we may make future acquisitions and/or alliances, which involve numerous risks. acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances, such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements, involve numerous risks, including the following: integrating the operations, technologies, and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations; increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities; increased debt levels; the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities; the use of cash to finance a transaction, which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, r&amp;d expenditures, and other business activities; diverting management's attention from daily operations; managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas; hiring and retaining key employees; requirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business; inability to realize synergies or other expected benefits; failure to maintain customer, vendor, and other relationships; inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company's internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance programs, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and impairment of acquired intangible assets, goodwill, or other assets as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements, or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired business. the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate. we engage, from time to time, in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities. to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions, we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above, including the risks pertaining to funding, assumption of liabilities, integration challenges, and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions. acquisitions of, or alliances with, technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. across our global operations, significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (our reporting currency), primarily the euro, singapore dollar, new taiwan dollar, and yen. in addition, a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies. exchange rates for some of these currencies against the u.s. dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods. if these currencies strengthen against the u.s. dollar, our manufacturing costs could significantly increase. exchange rates for the u.s. dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we may incur restructuring charges in future periods. from time to time, we have, and may in the future, enter into restructure initiatives in order to, among other items, streamline our operations, respond to changes in business conditions, our markets or product offerings, or to centralize certain key functions. we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives. in connection with any restructure initiatives, we could incur restructure charges, loss of production output, loss of key personnel, disruptions in our operations, and difficulties in the timely delivery of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 28 compliance with customer and responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials, supplies, and services used in manufacturing our products. many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to periodically report on our supply chain and responsible sourcing efforts to ensure we source the materials, supplies, and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell in a manner that is consistent with their programs. some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products meet the specifications of their responsible sourcing programs. meeting customer requirements may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials, supplies, and services we use, particularly when the availability of such materials, supplies, and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers. this in turn may affect our ability and/or the cost to obtain in sufficient quantities materials, supplies, and services necessary for the manufacture of our products. this increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and its implementing sec regulations. the act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo and finance or benefit local armed groups. these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors. our inability to comply with customers' requirements for responsible sourcing or with related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we and others are subject to a variety of laws, regulations, or industry standards that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities, equipment, and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. additionally, we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction, maintenance, and operations of our facilities. any changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs, as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition. any failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results. additionally, we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws, regulations, and industry standards. our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations. as a result of these items, we could experience the following: suspension of production or sales of our products; remediation costs; alteration of our manufacturing processes; regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; and reputational challenges. compliance with, or our failure, or the failure of our third-party sales channel partners or agents, to comply with, laws, regulations, or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. we are subject to counterparty default risks. we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks, including cash deposits, investments, and derivative instruments. additionally, we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them. as a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations. a counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us, which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure. additionally, our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action. if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty's 29 | 2020 10-k default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings. in the event of such default, we could incur significant losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. additionally, we, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors, including, but not limited to, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, regulatory changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. for these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment. volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources. the amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate, and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization, or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. the amount, timing, and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results, cash flows, and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. these purposes include, but are not limited to, operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, and repayment of debt. other factors, including changes in tax laws, could also impact our share repurchases. although our board of directors has authorized share repurchases of up to $10 billion of our outstanding common stock, the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock. we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. the repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a pause in, or termination of, this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. in addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio. as of september 3, 2020 and august 29, 2019, we had fixed-rate debt of $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, and as a result, the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates. we estimate that, as of september 3, 2020 and august 29, 2019, a decrease in market interest rates of 1% would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by nearly $300 million. as of september 3, 2020, we had variable-rate debt of $1.25 billion and, therefore, a 1% increase in the interest rates of our variable-rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately $13 million. as of august 29, 2019, we had no variable rate debt. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i item 1a. risk factors. changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for all of our operations is the u.s. dollar. the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the u.s. dollar; however, significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases, and certain assets and liabilities, are incurred in or exposed to other currencies, primarily the euro, new taiwan dollar, singapore dollar, and yen. we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates. we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these 45 | 2020 10-k hedging programs, which reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements. we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, we estimate that a 10% adverse change in exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would result in losses of approximately $98 million as of september 3, 2020 and $149 million as of august 29, 2019. we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three months. the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent, among other factors, upon our ability to accurately measure exposures on a timely basis. to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs, we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within two years. (seequantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company's liquid investments and long-term debt are at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. however, substantially all of the company's liquid investments mature within one year. as a result, the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of financial instruments is minimal. as of august 30, 2001, the company held aggregate cash and receivables in foreign currency valued at approximately us $48 million and aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at approximately us $453 million (including debt and capital lease obligations denominated in yen valued at approximately us $281 million). foreign currency payables and receivables are comprised primarily of yen, british pounds, singapore dollars and euros. 25 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of the company's liquid investments and long-term debt are at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of liquid investments is minimal as the majority of the company's investments mature within one year. the carrying value of the company's long-term debt was $454 million at august 29, 2002, and $531 million at august 30, 2001. the functional currency for substantially all of the company's operations is in the u.s. dollar. the company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currency valued at approximately u.s. $220 million as of august 29, 2002, and u.s. $239 million as of august 30, 2001 (including deferred tax assets denominated in japanese yen valued at approximately u.s. $165 million as of august 29, 2002, and u.s. $188 million as of august 30, 2001). the company also held aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at approximately u.s. $434 million as of august 29, 2002, and u.s. $453 million as of august 30, 2001 (including debt denominated in japanese yen valued at approximately u.s. $233 million as of august 29, 2002, and u.s. $281 million as of august 30, 2001). foreign currency receivables and payables are comprised primarily of japanese yen, euros, singapore dollars and british pounds. 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk substantially all of the company's investments are at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of investments is minimal as the company's investments generally mature within one year. all of the company's debt is at fixed interest rates; therefore, the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. the estimated fair market value of the company's debt as of august 28, 2003 and august 29, 2002, approximated $1.3 billion and $430 million, respectively. the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the "swap") that effectively converts, beginning august 29, 2003, the 2.5% fixed interest rate on the company's $632.5 million convertible subordinated notes (the "notes") to a variable interest rate based on the 3-month london interbank 30 offering rate ("libor") less 65 basis points. the swap qualifies as a fair-value hedge under sfas no. 133, "accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities." the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the notes attributable to changes in interest rates. foreign currency exchange rate risk the functional currency for substantially all of the company's operations is the u.s. dollar. the company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currency valued at u.s. $203.1 million as of august 28, 2003, and u.s. $220.4 million as of august 29, 2002 (including deferred income tax assets denominated in japanese yen valued at u.s. $105.4 million as of august 28, 2003, and u.s. $164.7 million as of august 29, 2002). the company also held aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at u.s. $513.2 million as of august 28, 2003, and u.s. $434.0 million as of august 29, 2002 (including debt denominated in japanese yen valued at u.s. $170.5 million as of august 28, 2003, and u.s. $233.1 million as of august 29, 2002). foreign currency receivables and payables as of august 28, 2003, were comprised primarily of japanese yen, euros, singapore dollars and british pounds. the company estimates that, based on its assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen as of august 28, 2003, a one yen change in the exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately $2 million. 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskrisk factors. all period references

governance listing standards. overview the company is an industry leading, global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor devices, principally dram and nand flash memory and cmos image sensors. the company products are offered in a wide variety of package and configuration options, architectures and performance characteristics tailored to meet application and customer needs. individual devices take advantage of the company advanced silicon processing technology and manufacturing expertise. the company aims to continually introduce new generations of products that offer lower costs per unit and improved performance characteristics. the company operates in two segments, memory and imaging. memory: the memory segment primary products are dram and nand flash, which are key components used in a broad array of electronic applications, including personal computers, workstations, network servers, mobile phones, flash memory cards, usb storage devices, mp3 players and other consumer electronics products. the company sells primarily to original equipment manufacturers, distributors and retailers located around the world. in 2006, the company took several steps towards establishing a significant presence in the nand flash market. in january 2006, the company partnered with intel corporation ( intel ) to form a nand flash manufacturing joint venture, im flash technologies, llc ( imft ), which is a consolidated subsidiary of the company. imft initiated an accelerated build-out and production ramp at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities that are expected to greatly increase the company production of nand flash in 2007. furthering its efforts to increase its share of the nand market, in june 2006, the company acquired lexar media, inc. ( lexar ), a designer, developer, manufacturer and marketer of flash memory products, in a stock-for-stock merger. the acquisition of lexar broadened the company nand product offering, enhanced the company retail presence and strengthened its portfolio of intellectual property. 1 imaging: the imaging segment primary products are cmos image sensors, which are key components used in a broad array of electronic applications, including mobile phones, digital still cameras, webcams and other consumer, security and automotive applications. the company primary customers are camera module integrators located around the world. during 2006, the company introduced several new leading-edge imaging products and significantly increased its imaging production, enabling it to become a market leader for cmos image sensors. products memory: the company memory segment has two primary product types: dram and nand flash. sales of memory products were 86%, 94% and 98% of the company total net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. dynamic random access memory ( dram ) : dram products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval. dram products were 76%, 87% and 92% of the company total net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the company offers dram products with a variety of performance, pricing and other characteristics. in recent years, the company has significantly increased its production and sales of specialty memory products such as pseudo-static ram, mobile dram and reduced latency dram. specialty memory products are generally targeted for networking, server and mobile applications that require specific performance characteristics such as low power and low latency. the transition to specialty memory products has reduced the company concentration on standardized, high-volume products sold for use as main memory in computers such as double data rate synchronous dram ( ddr ) and ddr2. ddr and ddr2: ddr and ddr2 are standardized, high-density, high-volume, dram products that are sold primarily for use as main system memory in computers. ddr and ddr2 products offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost compared to other semiconductor memory products. ddr products were 26%, 44% and 57% of the company total net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. ddr2 products were 25% and 14% the company total net sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. the company expects that ddr and ddr2 products will continue to decrease as a percentage of the company total net sales in 2007 due to significant increases in sales of the company other products. in response to changes in the dram market, the company has broadened its ddr and ddr2 product offerings in recent years. the company offers ddr products in 128 megabit ( mb ), 256 mb, 512 mb and 1 gigabit ( gb ) densities. the company also offers 256 mb, 512 mb, 1 gb and 2 gb ddr2 products. the company expects that these densities will be necessary to meet future customer demands for a broad array of products. the company also offers its ddr and ddr2 products in multiple configurations, speeds and package types. in september 2006, the company began sampling a 1 gb ddr3 device. synchronous dram ( sdram ): in 2006 and 2005, sdram was primarily used in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment and computer peripherals as well as memory upgrades to legacy computers. sales of sdram products were 16%, 20% and 31% of the company total net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. sdram sales have declined as personal computer manufacturers have transitioned to ddr and ddr2 products. the decline has been partially offset by increased usage of sdram products in other applications. the company offers 64 mb, 128 mb, 256 mb and 512 mb sdram products. pseudo-static ram ( psram ): psram products, marketed by the company under the proprietary brand name cellularram , are dram products with an sram-like interface. psram combines the minimal power consumption of sram with a much lower cost-per-bit to provide an economical alternative to sram. psram products are used primarily in cellular phone applications. the company offers psram products in 16 mb, 32 mb, 64 mb and 128 mb densities. the company is the market leader in sales of psram products. sales of psram products were 8% and 7% of the company total net sales in 2006 and 2005, respectively. mobile dram: mobile dram products are specialty dram memory devices designed for applications that demand minimal power consumption, such as personal digital assistants (pdas), smart phones, gps devices, digital still cameras and other handheld electronic devices. the company sells sdram and ddr mobile memory products in 64 mb, 128 mb, 256 mb and 512 mb densities. the company mobile dram products feature its proprietary endur-ic technology, which the company believes provides distinct advantages to its customers in terms of low power, high quality and high reliability. 2 reduced latency dram ( rldram ): rldram products are low-latency dram memory devices with high clock rates targeted at network applications. the company offers rldram in 256 mb and 288 mb densities and expects to begin shipping 576 mb densities in 2007. nand flash memory : flash memory products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor devices that retain memory content when power is turned off. the company flash efforts are concentrated on nand flash ( nand ) devices which use semiconductor technology similar to dram. nand is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its faster erase and write times, higher density, and lower cost per bit than nor flash, which is the primary competing flash architecture. the market for nand products has grown rapidly and the company expects it to continue to grow due to demand for removable and embedded storage devices. removable storage devices such as usb and flash memory cards are used with applications such as personal computers, digital still cameras, mp3 players and mobile phones. embedded nand-based storage devices are also utilized in mobile phones and other personal and consumer applications. nand and dram share common manufacturing processes, enabling t he company to leverage its product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure. the company nand designs feature a small cell structure that allows for higher densities for demanding applications. in 2006, the company offered nand products in 1 gb, 2 gb, 4 gb and 8 gb densities and plans to introduce 16 gb densities in 2007. in 2006, the company products were manufactured primarily using 72nm and 90nm line-width process technology and began sampling products manufactured using 50nm line-width process technology. in addition, in 2006, the company began sampling multi-level cell ( mlc ) nand products, which double the bit density compared to single level cell products. nand sales were 6% of the company total net sales in 2006. the company expects sales of nand to increase significantly in 2007 and 2008 as it ramps production from two 300mm facilities dedicated to nand production and recognizes sales by its lexar subsidiary. as a result of its acquisition of lexar, the company began selling in the fourth quarter of 2006 high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and original equipment manufacturing (oem) channels. the company digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards with a range of speeds, capacities and value-added features. the company digital media products also include its jumpdrive products, which are high-speed, portable usb flash drives for consumer applications that serve a variety of uses, including floppy disk replacement, digital media accessories and a variety of connectivity products that link media products to pcs and other electronic host devices. the company also licenses its patented controller technology to other companies. the company offers flash memory cards in all major media formats currently used by digital cameras and other electronic host devices, including: compactflash, memory stick, secure digital card and the xd picture card. many of compactflash, memory stick and memory stick pro products sold by the company incorporate its patented controller technology. other products, including secure digital card flash memory cards and some jumpdrive products, incorporate third party controllers. the company also resells flash memory products that are purchased from suppliers. the company offers flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities. the company also offers more advanced features in some flash media card products that provide additional performance advantages, such as write acceleration, or wa technology, the activememory system and locktight compactflash. the company sells products under its lexar brand and also manufactures products that are sold under other brand names. the company has a multi-year agreement with eastman kodak to sell digital media products under the kodak brand name. imaging: complementary metal-oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) image sensors are the primary product of the company imaging segment. cmos image sensors are semiconductor devices that capture and process images into pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications. the company cmos image sensors are used in products such as cellular phone cameras, digital still cameras, pill cameras for medical use, and in automotive and other emerging applications. the company offers image sensors in a range of pixel resolutions from its vga (video graphics array) products to its higher resolution 3.1-megapixel products. the company has begun sampling a 5-megapixel sensor designed for use in digital still cameras and camera phones that it expects to begin shipping in commercial volumes in 2007. in 2006, the company introduced an 8-megapixel sensor featuring a leading-edge pixel size of 1.75 square microns. image sensors are sold either as individual components or combined with integrated circuitry to create complete camera system-on-a-chip ( soc ) solutions. the company cmos image sensors incorporating its digitalclarity technology offered many advantages over other cmos image sensors and charge-coupled device ( ccd ) sensors in 2006, which enabled the company to become the leader in cmos image sensor market share. the company digitalclarity technology features active pixels enabling better sensor performance that produces higher-quality images at faster frame rates. the company low-leakage dram processes are particularly well-suited for the manufacture of cmos image sensors. the company cmos image sensors consume substantially less power than ccd devices, a critical advantage in battery-dependent portable device applications where most 3 image sensors are used. by combining all camera functions on a single chip, from the capture of photons to the output of digital bits, cmos image sensors reduce the part-count of a digital camera system, which in turn increases reliability, eases miniaturization, and enables on-chip programming of frame size, windowing, exposure and other camera parameters. the company cmos image sensors are also capable of producing high-quality images in low-light conditions. in 2006, the company cmos image sensors active-pixel design architecture enabled the company to achieve cmos imager performance that was comparable to high-end ccd sensors and better than that of its competitor cmos image sensors. sales of imaging products were 14%, 6% and 2% of the company total net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. the company expects its sales of cmos image sensors to continue to grow in 2007 due to strong demand and increases in the allocation of manufacturing capacity. the overall market for image sensors is expected to increase significantly over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras. additionally, cmos image sensors are expected to capture an increasing percentage of the overall image sensor market. manufacturing the company manufacturing facilities are located in the united states, italy, japan, puerto rico and singapore. the company manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment. the company process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly and test. efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer. other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. the company is continuously enhancing production processes, reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products. in 2006, t he company manufactured most of its dram products using its 95 nanometer ( nm ) and 110nm line-width process technology and began transferring production to 78nm line-width process technology. the company expects to continue to transfer more of its dram production to 78nm and lower line-width process technology in 2007. in 2006, the company manufactured most of its nand flash memory products using its 72nm and 90nm line-width process technology. the company expects to begin transferring its nand production to 50nm line-width process technology in 2007. wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. despite stringent manufacturing controls, dust particles, equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional. success of the company manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of high-quality circuits. in this regard, the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening and testing processes. the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. after fabrication, silicon wafers are separated into individual die. the company sells semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. bare die ) forms. for packaged products, functional die are sorted, connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages. the company assembles products in a variety of packages, including tsop (thin small outline package), tqfp (thin quad flat package) and fbga (f ine pitch ball grid array). bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility. bare die products are used in packaging technologies such as systems-in-a-package (sips) and multi-chip packages (mcps), which reduce the board area required. the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process, performs high temperature burn-in on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. in addition, the company uses its proprietary ambyx line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost. 4 the company assembles a significant portion of its memory products into memory modules. memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards ( pcbs ) that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices. the company lexar subsidiary contracts with an independent foundry and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices. in 2006, the company significantly increased its 300mm wafer production. in 2007, the company plans to continue increasing its 300mm wafer manufacturing capacity as its imft subsidiary ramps nand flash production at two 300mm facilities and the company consolidated tech joint venture converts its dram production to 300mm wafers. in recent years the company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances the company ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but increases the complexity of the manufacturing process. although new product lines such as nand flash, cmos image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the company predominant dram products, frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts can affect the company cost efficiency. the company ability to competitively manufacture many of these products on existing 200mm lines extends the useful life of this equipment. im flash technologies, llc ( imft ): imft, which began operations on january 6, 2006, is a joint venture between the company and intel. imft manufactures nand flash memory products pursuant to nand flash designs developed by the company and intel and licensed to the company. the parties share the output of imft generally in proportion to their investment in imft. the company owned a 51% interest in imft at august 31, 2006. imft financial results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements joint ventures im flash technologies, llc. ) tech semiconductor singapore pte. ltd. ( tech ) : tech is a memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore among micron technology, inc., the singapore economic development board, canon inc. and hewlett-packard company. the company owned an approximate 43% interest in tech at august 31, 2006. tech semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the company product and process technology. subject to specific terms and conditions, the company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech. tech supplied approximately 25%, 25% and 30% of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. tech financial results were included in the consolidated financial statements of the company beginning in the third quarter of 2006. (see item 8. financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements joint ventures tech semiconductor singapore pte. ltd. ) mp mask technology center, llc ( mp mask ): in the third quarter of 2006, the company formed a joint venture, mp mask, with photronics, inc. ( photronics ) to produce photomasks for leading-edge and advanced next generation semiconductors. the company contributed its then existing reticle manufacturing operation to the venture and sold a 49.99% interest in mp mask to photronics. the company and photronics also entered into supply arrangements wherein the company is expected to purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask. the financial results of mp mask are included in the consolidated financial results of the company. availability of raw materials the company production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards, including several that are customized for, or unique to, the company. the company generally has multiple sources of supply; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company standards. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames, molding compound and other materials. in addition, any transportation problems could delay the company receipt of raw materials. although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company operations in the past, shortages may occur from time to time in the future. also, lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if the company supply of raw materials is interrupted, or lead times are extended, results of operations could be adversely affected. 5 marketing and customers the company products are sold into computing and consumer, networking and telecommunications, and imaging markets. approximately 70% of the company net sales for 2006 were to the computing market, including desktop pcs, notebooks, servers and workstations. sales to hewlett-packard company exceeded 10% of the company net sales in 2006. sales to both hewlett-packard company and dell computer corporation exceeded 10% of the company net sales in 2005 and 2004, and aggregated 23% and 27% of the company net sales in 2005 and 2004, respectively. the company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force. the company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments. the company products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. lexar sells nand flash memory through retail and oem channels and crucial technology offers its products through the company web-based customer direct sales division. the company products are offered under the micron, lexar, spectek and crucial brand names, and under other private labels. the company maintains sales offices in all of its primary markets around the world. independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis. the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer. distributors carry the company products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors products. the company offers products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing, server, automotive, networking, security, commercial/industrial, consumer electronics, medical and mobile applications. many of the company customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing products, more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company. backlog volatile industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. accordingly, new order volumes for the company semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty. for these reasons, the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. in accordance with industry practice, the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery. under the company general terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. under certain circumstances the company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the company general terms and conditions. competition the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; hynix semiconductor inc.; qimonda ag ads; samsung electronics co., ltd; sandisk corporation; toshiba corporation and emerging companies in taiwan and china. some of the company competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. the company competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices. 6 the company faces competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors including magnachip semiconductor ltd.; omnivision technologies, inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd; sony corporation; stmicroelectronics nv; toshiba corporation and from a number of suppliers of ccd image sensors including matsushita electric industrial co., ltd.; sharp corporation and sony corporation. in recent periods, a number of new companies have entered the cmos image sensor market. competitors include many large domestic and international companies that may have greater presence in key markets, better access to certain customer bases, greater name recognition and more established strategic and financial relationships than the company. research and development to compete in the semiconductor memory industry, the company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. the company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and imaging solutions. the company has several product design centers around the world, the largest located at its corporate headquarters in boise, idaho. in addition, the company develops leading edge photolithography mask technology at its mp mask joint venture facility in boise. research and development ( r&amp;d ) expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products, the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. r&amp;d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. the company and intel share r&amp;d process and design costs for nand flash equally. product development costs are recorded as r&amp;d expense. the company process technology r&amp;d efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller line-width process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company transition to next generation memory products and cmos image sensors. additional process technology r&amp;d efforts focus on specialty memory products (including psram, mobile sdram and reduced latency dram) and new manufacturing materials. product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company 1 gb and 2 gb ddr, ddr2 and ddr3 products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory (including multi-level cell technology), cmos image sensors and specialty memory products. the company r&amp;d expenses were $656 million, $604 million and $755 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. geographic information sales to customers outside the united states totaled $3.6 billion for 2006 and included $1.0 billion in sales to china, $719 million in sales to europe, $494 million in sales to japan and $1.1 billion in sales to the rest of the asia pacific region, excluding china and japan. international sales totaled $3.2 billion for

million in italy and $12 million in other countries. patents and licenses in recent years, the company has been recognized as a leader in volume and quality of patents issued. as of august 31, 2006, the company owned approximately 14,500 u.s. patents and 1,500 foreign patents. in addition, the company has numerous u.s. and foreign patent applications pending. the company patents have terms expiring through 2025. the company has a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require the company to make one time or periodic payments. the company may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. the company is unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. 7 employees as of august 31, 2006, the company had approximately 23,500 employees, including approximately 14,100 in the united states, 5,500 in singapore, 2,000 in italy, 1,400 in japan and 300 in the united kingdom. the company employees include 2,400 employees in its tech joint venture that are located in singapore and 800 employees in its imft joint venture that are located in the united states. the company added approximately 300 employees from its acquisition of lexar media, inc. in the fourth quarter of 2006. the company employees in italy are represented by labor organizations that have entered into national and local labor contracts with the company. the company employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of the company production, research and product and process development. many of the company employees are highly skilled, and the company continued success depends in part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees. the loss of key company personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company business, results of operations or financial condition. environmental compliance government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions and solid wastes from the company manufacturing processes. in 2006, the company wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification. to continue certification, the company met annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping and management review. while the company has not experienced any materially adverse effects on its operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of operations or other compliance actions. directors and executive officers of the registrant officers of the company are appointed annually by the board of directors. directors of the company are elected annually by the shareholders of the company. any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders. all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation or removal. as of august 31, 2006, the following executive

on the company board of directors since july 1998. mr. weber holds a bs in engineering from lamar university and a ms in engineering from southern methodist university. there is no family relationship between any director or executive officer of the company. 10 item 1a. risk factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10-k, the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward- looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business. per megabit average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products decreased 34% in 2006 as compared to 2005. in recent years, we have also experienced annual decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our memory products including: 24% in 2005, 17% in 2003, 53% in 2002 and 60% in 2001. at times, average selling prices for our memory products have been below our costs. if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. increased worldwide semiconductor memory production or lack of demand for semiconductor memory could lead to further declines in average selling prices. the transitions to smaller line-width process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and will likely lead to future increases. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. we and several of our competitors have announced plans to increase production through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities. increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past. historically, our gross margin has benefited from decreases in per unit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes, including reducing the die size of our existing products. in future periods, we may be unable to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs or reduce these costs at historical rates due to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix, the ever increasing complexity of manufacturing processes, changes in process technologies or products which inherently may require relatively larger die sizes. per unit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of imaging and certain specialty memory products. our formation of imft and the resulting plans to significantly increase our nand flash memory production has numerous risks. on january 6, 2006, we initiated operations of the imft joint venture with intel and as a result we plan to significantly increase our nand flash production in future periods. the imft agreement and our nand flash strategy in general require substantial investment in capital expenditures for equipment and new facilities. it also requires significant investments in research and development as well as investments to grow and develop new operations at multiple sites. these investments involve numerous risks. we are required to devote a significant portion of our existing semiconductor manufacturing capacity to the production of nand flash instead of the company other products. in conjunction with the imft agreement, we entered into a contract with apple corporation to provide nand flash products for an extended period of time at contractually determined prices. we currently have a relatively small share of the world-wide market for nand flash. our nand flash investments and commitments involve numerous risks, and may include the following: increasing our exposure to changes in average selling prices for nand flash; difficulties in establishing new production operations at multiple locations; increasing capital expenditures to increase production capacity and modify existing processes to produce nand flash; increasing debt to finance future investments; 11 diverting management attention from dram and cmos image sensor operations; managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas; and hiring and retaining key employees. our nand flash strategy may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. the future success of our imaging business will be dependent on continued market acceptance of our products and the development, introduction and marketing of new imaging products. our imaging business has grown rapidly in the recent periods. sales of imaging products increased substantially and represented 14% of our net sales in 2006. our imaging products have higher gross margins than the recent overall gross margins from our memory products. as we continue to expand our imaging business, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these growth rates or gross margins. the continued success of our imaging products will depend on a number of factors, including: development of products that maintain a technological advantage over the products of our competitors; accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards, including pixel resolution, output interface standards, power requirements, optical lens size, input standards and other requirements; timely completion and introduction of new imaging products that satisfy customer requirements; timely achievement of design wins with prospective customers, as manufacturers may be reluctant to change their source of components due to the significant costs, time, effort and risk associated with qualifying a new supplier; and efficient, cost-effective manufacturing as we transition to new products and higher volumes. we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments. our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and cmos image sensors sold, average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs. to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technology. cash and investments of imft and tech are generally not available to finance our other operations. in addition to cash provided by operations, we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing. depending on general market and economic conditions or other factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments. the semiconductor industry is highly competitive. we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including elpida memory, inc.; hynix semiconductor inc.; qimonda ag ads; samsung electronics co., ltd.; sandisk corporation; toshiba corporation and from emerging companies in taiwan and china, who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations. some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete, invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities. our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs. these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices. 12 we face competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors including magnachip semiconductor ltd.; omnivision technologies, inc.; samsung electronics co., ltd; sony corporation; stmicroelectronics nv; toshiba corporation and from a number of suppliers of ccd image sensors matsushita electric industrial co., ltd.; sharp corporation and sony corporation. in recent periods, a number of new companies have entered the cmos image sensor market. competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater presence in key markets, better access to certain customer bases, greater name recognition and more established strategic and financial relationships than the company. we may have difficulty integrating the operations of lexar. if we are unable to successfully combine and integrate the lexar operations, we may not be able to realize many of the anticipated benefits of the merger, which could harm our results of operations. in order to realize the benefits of the merger, we will need to timely integrate the technology, operations, and personnel of lexar. integrating the two companies will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, even with proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt the businesses of micron and lexar. the challenges involved in this integration include, combining product and service offerings, optimizing inventory management over a broader distribution chain, and preserving customer, supplier and other important relationships of both micron and lexar. if we are not able to successfully integrate our operations with those of lexar, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected by material weaknesses in lexar internal controls. in lexar annual report on form 10-k for the period ended december 31, 2005, and its quarterly report on form 10-q for the period ended march 31, 2006, lexar reported material weaknesses with respect to its revenue recognition controls and inventory accounting controls. these control deficiencies resulted in audit adjustments to revenues, accounts receivable, cost of product revenues, deferred revenue, sales related accruals and inventory in lexar 2005 consolidated financial statements. as a result of these material weaknesses, lexar concluded in its annual report and quarterly report that its control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the periods covered by the reports. while prior to the close of the merger lexar continued to take steps to remediate these material weaknesses, there can be no assurance that we will be able to completely remediate these material weaknesses such that we will be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. we began consolidating the financial results of lexar on june 22, 2006; however, due to the recency of the acquisition, the internal control over financial reporting relating to lexar was exempt from testing and evaluation as of august 31, 2006. to the extent we do not remediate the material weaknesses, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may be adversely affected. our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of the merger. micron and lexar had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes prior to the merger and both entities had provided significant valuation allowances against the tax benefit of such losses as well as certain tax credit carryforwards. utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards are dependent upon us achieving profitable results following the lexar merger. as a consequence of the merger, as well as earlier issuances of common stock consummated by both companies and business combinations by the company, utilization of the tax benefits of these carryforwards are subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code. the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions. accordingly, some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income. our resellers receive price protections which may have an adverse affect on our gross margins. nearly all of our lexar sales are made through resellers which traditionally have been provided price protection. in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products, price declines and channel promotions expenses are more likely to occur. further, in this environment, high channel inventory may result in substantial price protection charges. these price protection charges have the effect of reducing gross sales and gross margin. we expect to continue to incur price protection charges for the foreseeable future due to competitive pricing pressures and, as a result, our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected. 13 changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our financial statements are prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and are reported in u.s. dollars. across our multi-national operations, there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies, primarily the yen and euro. the company estimates that, based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollar as of august 31, 2006, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately $1 million for the yen and $1 million for the euro. in the event that the u.s. dollar weakens significantly compared to the yen or euro, our results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected. new product development may be unsuccessful. we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology. we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years. the process to develop nand flash, imaging and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance, many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production, in order to secure design wins with our customers. there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful, that we will be able to cost-effectively manufacture these new products, that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts. an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries, from time to time, others have asserted, and may in the future assert, that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights. in this regard, we are engaged in litigation with rambus, inc. ( rambus ) relating to certain of rambus patents and certain of our claims and defenses. on august 28, 2000, we filed a complaint (subsequently amended) against rambus in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. among other things, our amended complaint alleges violation of federal antitrust laws, breach of contract, fraud, deceptive trade practices, and negligent misrepresentation. the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment (a) that certain rambus patents are not infringed by us, are invalid, and/or are unenforceable, (b) that we have an implied license to those patents, and (c) that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us. on february 15, 2001, rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in delaware denying that we are entitled to relief, alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim, and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. a number of other suits are pending in europe alleging that certain of our sdram and ddr sdram products infringe various of rambus country counterparts to its european patent 525 068, including: on september 1, 2000, rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor (deutschland) gmbh in the district court of mannheim, germany; on september 22, 2000, rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic (a distributor of our products) in the court of first instance of paris, france; and on september 29, 2000, we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan, italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement. in addition, on december 29, 2000, we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano, italy, alleging invalidity and non-infringement of the italian counterpart to european patent 1 004 956. additionally, other suits are pending alleging that certain of our ddr sdram products infringe rambus country counterparts to its european patent 1 022 642, including: on august 10, 2001, rambus filed suit against us and assitec (an electronics retailer) in the civil court of pavia, italy; and on august 14, 2001, rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor (deutschland) gmbh in the district court of mannheim, germany. in the european suits against us, rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. subsequent to the filing of the various european suits, the european patent office declared rambus 525 068 and 1 004 956 european patents invalid and revoked the patents. on january 13, 2006, rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california alleging infringement of eighteen rambus patents. we also are engaged in litigation with tadahiro ohmi ( ohmi ). on june 2, 2005, ohmi filed suit against us in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of texas (amended on august 31, 2005) alleging infringement of a single ohmi patent. we are also engaged in litigation with mosaid technologies, inc. ( mosaid ). on july 24, 2006, we filed a declaratory judgment action against mosaid in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california seeking, among other things, a court determination that fourteen mosaid patents are invalid, not enforceable, and/or not infringed. on july 26, 2006, mosaid filed a lawsuit against us and others in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of texas alleging infringement of nine mosaid patents. on august 31, 2006, mosaid filed an amended complaint adding two additional mosaid patents. on october 23, 2006, the california court dismissed our declaratory judgment suit based on lack of jurisdiction. 14 among other things, the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our sdram, ddr sdram, ddr2 sdram, rldram, and image sensor products, which account for a significant portion of our net sales. a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and/or require us to make material changes to our products and/or manufacturing processes. we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us. any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements. some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments. we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future. we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. allegations of anticompetitive conduct. on june 17, 2002, we received a grand jury subpoena from the u.s. district court for the northern district of california seeking information regarding an investigation by the antitrust division of the department of justice (the doj ) into possible antitrust violations in the dynamic random access memory or dram industry. we are cooperating fully and actively with the doj in its investigation of the dram industry. our cooperation is pursuant to the terms of the doj corporate leniency policy, which provides that in exchange for our full, continuing and complete cooperation in the pending investigation, we will not be subject to prosecution, fines or other penalties from the doj. subsequent to the commencement of the doj investigation, a number of purported class action lawsuits have been filed against us and other dram suppliers. eighteen cases have been filed in various federal district courts (two of which have been dismissed) asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased dram directly from various dram suppliers during the period from april 1, 1999 through at least june 30, 2002. all of the cases have been transferred to the u.s. district court for the northern district of california for consolidated proceedings. the complaints allege price-fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and seek treble monetary damages, costs, attorneys fees, and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct. on june 5, 2006, the court granted plaintiffs motion to certify the proposed class of direct purchasers. four cases have been filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased dram and/or products containing dram from various dram suppliers during the time period from april 1, 1999 through at least june 30, 2002. the complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition laws and seek treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys fees. in addition, at least sixty-two cases have been filed in various state and federal courts (five of which have been dismissed) asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of dram. cases have been filed in the following states: arkansas, arizona, california, florida, hawaii, iowa, kansas, massachusetts, maine, michigan, minnesota, mississippi, montana, north carolina, north dakota, nebraska, new hampshire, new jersey, new mexico, nevada, new york, ohio, pennsylvania, south dakota, tennessee, utah, vermont, virginia, wisconsin, and west virginia, and also in the district of columbia and puerto rico. the complaints purport to be on behalf of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased dram and/or products containing dram in the respective jurisdictions during various time periods ranging from 1999 through the filing date of the various complaints. the complaints allege violations of various jurisdictions antitrust, consumer protection and/or unfair competition laws relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seek treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys fees. a number of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the u.s. district court for the northern district of california (san francisco) for consolidated proceedings. additionally, three cases have been filed in the following canadian courts: superior court, district of montreal, province of quebec; ontario superior court of justice, ontario; and supreme court of british columbia, vancouver registry, british columbia. the substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in the united states. in addition, various states, through their attorneys general, have filed suit against us and other dram manufacturers. on july 14, 2006, the following states filed suit in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california: alaska, arizona, arkansas, california, colorado, delaware, florida, hawaii, idaho, illinois, iowa, kentucky, louisiana, maine, maryland, massachusetts, michigan, minnesota, mississippi, nebraska, nevada, new hampshire, new mexico, north carolina, north dakota, the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, ohio, oklahoma, oregon, pennsylvania, rhode island, south carolina, tennessee, texas, utah, vermont, virginia, washington, west virginia, and wisconsin. the amended complaint, filed september 8, 2006, alleges, among other things, violations of the sherman act, cartwright act, and certain other states consumer protection and antitrust laws and seeks damages, and injunctive and other relief. additionally, on july 13, 2006, the 15 state of new york filed a similar suit in the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york. that case was subsequently transferred to the u.s. district court for the northern district of california for pre-trial purposes. on october 11, 2006, we received a grand jury subpoena from the u.s. district court for the northern district of california seeking information regarding an investigation by the doj into possible antitrust violations in the static random access memory or sram industry. we believe that we are not a target of the investigation and we are cooperating fully and actively with the doj in its investigation of the sram industry. subsequent to the issuance of subpoenas to the sram industry, a number of purported class action lawsuits have been filed against us and other sram suppliers. two cases have been filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased sram directly from various sram suppliers during the period from january 1, 1998 through december 31, 2005. additionally, eight cases have been filed in the u.s. district court for the northern district of california and one in the u.s. district court for the eastern district of tennessee asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased sram and/or products containing sram from various sram suppliers during the time period from january 1, 1998 through december 31, 2005. the complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and state antitrust and unfair competition laws and seek treble monetary damages, restitution, costs, interest and attorneys fees. on may 5, 2004, rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california (san francisco county) against us and other dram suppliers. the complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on rambus dram ( rdram ), and unfair competition. the complaint seeks treble damages, punitive damages, attorneys fees, costs, and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaints. we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and investigations. the final resolution of these alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. allegations of violations of securities laws. on february 24, 2006, a putative class action complaint was filed against us and certain of our officers in the u.s. district court for the district of idaho alleging claims under section 10(b) and 20(a) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended, and rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. four substantially similar complaints subsequently were filed in the same court. the cases purport to be brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of our stock during the period february 24, 2001 to february 13, 2003. the five lawsuits have been consolidated and a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed on july 24, 2006. the complaint generally alleges violations of federal securities laws based on, among other things, claimed misstatements or omissions regarding alleged illegal price-fixing conduct. the complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, attorneys fees, costs, and expenses. in addition, on march 23, 2006 a shareholder derivative action was filed in the fourth district court for the state of idaho (ada county), allegedly on behalf of and for our benefit, against certain of our current and former officers and directors. we were also named as a nominal defendant. the complaint is based on the same allegations of fact as in the securities class actions filed in the u.s. district court for the district of idaho and alleges breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and insider trading. the complaint seeks unspecified damages, restitution, disgorgement of profits, equitable and injunctive relief, attorneys fees, costs, and expenses. the complaint is derivative in nature and does not seek monetary damages from us. however, we may be required, throughout the pendency of the action, to advance payment of legal fees and costs incurred by the defendants. in march 2006, following our announcement of a definitive agreement to acquire lexar media, inc. ( lexar ) in a stock-for-stock merger, four purported class action complaints were filed in the superior court for the state of california (alameda county) on behalf of shareholders of lexar against lexar and its directors. two of the complaints also name us as a defendant. the complaints allege that the defendants breached, or aided and abetted the breach of, fiduciary duties owed to lexar shareholders by, among other things, engaging in self-dealing, failing to engage in efforts to obtain the highest price reasonably available, and failing to properly value lexar in connection with a merger transaction between lexar and us. the plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing, or an order of rescission reversing, the merger, compensatory damages, interest, attorneys fees, and costs. on may 19, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to block the merger. on may 31, 2006, the court denied the motion. 16 we are unable to predict the outcome of these cases. a court determination in any of the class actions against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. current economic and political conditions may harm our business. global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce. if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market, manufacture or ship our products. global economic conditions may also affect consumer demand for devices that incorporate our products such as mobile phones, personal computers, flash memory cards and usb devices. as a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. sales to customers outside the united states approximated 67% of our consolidated net sales for 2006. in addition, we have manufacturing operations in italy, japan, puerto rico and singapore. our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including: currency exchange rate fluctuations, export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, political and economic instability, problems with the transportation or delivery of our products, issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest, longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, and compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions. these factors may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. if our manufacturing process is disrupted, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance. difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs. additionally, our control over operations at our imft, tech and mp mask joint ventures may be limited by our agreements with our partners. from time to time, we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment failures. if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason, manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers. this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials. however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, lead frames and molding compound. shortages may occur from time to time in the future. in addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 17 products that do not meet specifications or that contain, or are perceived by our customers to contain, defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. if, despite design review, quality control and product qualification procedures, problems with nonconforming, defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products, we could be adversely affected in several ways, including the following: we may replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product, and we may encounter adverse publicity, which could cause a decrease in sales of our products. we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable, which involve numerous risks. we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance shareholder value. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including: difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities, increasing debt to finance any acquisition, diverting management attention from normal daily operations, managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas, and hiring and retaining key employees. mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of august 31, 2006, $469 million of the company $571 million in total debt was at fixed interest rates. as a result, the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates. the estimated fair market value of the company debt was $627 million as of august 31, 2006. foreign currency exchange rate risk the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item 1a. risk factors. changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect the company results of operations or financial condition. the functional currency for substantially all of the company operations is the u.s. dollar. the company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at u.s. $425 million as of august 31, 2006, and u.s. $344 million as of september 1, 2005 (including cash and equivalents denominated in yen valued at u.s. $222 million as of august 31, 2006, and u.s. $215 million as of september 1, 2005; cash and equivalents denominated in singapore dollars valued at u.s. $42 million; and deferred income tax assets denominated in yen valued at u.s. $64 million as of august 31, 2006, and u.s. $51 million as of september 1, 2005). the company also held aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at u.s. $615 million as of august 31, 2006, and u.s. $575 million as of september 1, 2005 (including debt denominated in yen valued at u.s. $228 million as of august 31, 2006, and u.s. $299 million as of september 1, 2005). foreign currency receivables and payables as of august 31, 2006, were comprised primarily of yen, euros, singapore dollars and british pounds. the company estimates that, based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than u.s. dollar as of august 31, 2006, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately $1 million for the yen and $1 million for the euro. 34
