risk factors progressive's business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks - risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses of, or liabilities incurred by, policyholders operating risks - the risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks - changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios, which might result from a variety of factors impacting the investment marketplace generally, or the sectors, industries, or individual securities in which we have invested, and credit risks - the risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under insurance risks, market risks, and credit risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially. this information is not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ), as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. - 14 - i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, floods, other severe weather, and terrorist events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claims settlement practices changing driving patterns advancements in vehicle technology and safety features, such as accident prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations unforeseen disruptive technologies, events, legislation, or regulation, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices. the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. - 15 - our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 10 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on july 12, 2013. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools and third-party experts to help estimate our exposures to such events. those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations. ii. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information and other technologies), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. - 16 - our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses, all of which are highly competitive markets. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised. in addition, due to our focus on the auto insurance market, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time. for example, if governmental mandates or restrictions, economic conditions, demographic trends, changing driving patterns, rising gasoline prices, advancements in vehicle technology or safety features, or other factors, were to result in decreased demand for auto insurance or decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period, the automobile insurance market as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired. historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. unexpected increases in the insurers' underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. as the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies, as a result of varying loss cost experiences, trend recognition capabilities, and profitability goals), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for progressive's business prospects at that time. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophic fund, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer's former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term. our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors' initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity, while delivering high quality products and services. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors', then-current or historical modes of doing business, and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. these innovations also may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes, and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk, which makes their implementation a challenge. in addition, our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with, or in reliance on, third-party vendors and their systems, which may further limit our control of implementation, quality, customer experiences, and successful outcomes. our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set. our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition, our business could be materially adversely affected. at the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry and adversely affect our competitive position. these developments can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technological advances, or new ways of doing business, among other initiatives. recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace include: new ways for customers to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, the growth in mobile communications and consumers' desire to transact business on mobile devices, the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers, and the availability of very large volumes of data and the challenges related to analyzing those data sets (sometimes referred to as big data ). our ability to react to such advances, develop and maintain winning strategies, and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success. - 17 - ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. this complexity may create barriers to implementing or defending certain new ideas or providing high-quality products and customer experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies. in addition, we must make difficult decisions regarding the optimal allocation of available resources (such as information technology resources) for competing initiatives or projects. complexity in our industry is compounded by the proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being marketed, sold, and serviced, which may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their patent rights. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us. however, defending our business practices against patent challenges, and enforcing and defending our patent rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, further complicating business plans related to these efforts. if we are unable to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors, our businesses could experience decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business, poor experiences for customers, substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, regulatory investigations and sanctions, and damage to our brand. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, enhance consumers' perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market. if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. these situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, systems failures, effects of cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), errors in handling a customer's policy, inappropriate handling of claims, misconduct by our officers, directors or employees or others acting on our behalf, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of third-party systems that we use, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by our other business partners, including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance), and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors. moreover, the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technical, analytical, and other skills necessary for us to run our business. our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, and brand could be materially adversely affected. - 18 - our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. progressive's insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, privacy, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries' ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries' ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by court-imposed interpretations of those laws or regulations, such as, in recent years, matters concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, procedures for settling claims with our insureds and claimants, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries' ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries' ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary's authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. for example, the federal insurance office (fio) collects information about the insurance industry and monitors the industry for systemic risk. in december 2013, the fio submitted a report to congress recommending reforms intended to modernize and improve the u.s. system of insurance regulation. the report proposes significant changes to existing state regulations and includes a number of recommendations that would result in direct federal regulation of the insurance industry. at this time, we are unable to predict whether any additional state or federal laws or regulations will be enacted as a result of the fio report, or as a result of other legislative, regulatory or reform efforts, and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive's insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 6 of this report. - 19 - our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization's culture and the effectiveness of its management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the effectiveness of our service center program and other methods of resolving claims. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries' business operations. other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits have recently included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries' use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; policy implementation and renewal procedures; and employment-related litigation, including federal wage and hour claims, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries' business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of medical or attorney malpractice, and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries' business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices, including how vehicles are repaired and other claims are settled. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of court-imposed regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 - litigation in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. these systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities. such attacks may include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. similarly, an employee, consultant, agent, or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions, or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack, which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and in the loss, corruption, or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees. - 20 - we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party vendors, which may provide software, data storage, communication, and other computer services to us (some of which may be referred to as cloud computing ). these third-party systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches, along with the possible risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of progressive's information or the confidential information of our customers and employees. these relationships present further risk management challenges for us, including, among others: confirming and monitoring the third-party's security measures; the potential for improper handling of or access to, or the inability to retrieve, our data; and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security assurance. examples include physical security measures, access and password policies, firewalls, systems monitoring, malicious code protection, network and host-based intrusion detection and prevention measures, data loss prevention measures, configuration assurance, data encryption, and event management, as well as third-party testing. in addition, we seek to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards, and ongoing testing, auditing, and evaluation of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party's systems are adversely affected. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments, such as progressive, must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information. while the pci standards set a high bar for data security, compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis. in september 2013, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes, recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci's data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions. our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks (as discussed above), riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities. likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. - 21 - the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; we could experience service denials if demand for a third party's services exceeds capacity or if a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, resolve and pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. any such event could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill and to our brand. our business is also highly dependent on access to, and the operation of, the financial markets and related facilities to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. this risk includes the possibility of permanent loss. in the case of governmental issuers, the risk includes the potential for unbalanced budgets, required austerity measures, debt defaults, bankruptcies, or other social or political turmoil. concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk - applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions. prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates. liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio's performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized securities rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. - 22 - the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by external investment advisory firms. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as energy, technology, or financial services, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital. likewise, the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisors, including sector or industry concentrations, lack of geographic diversification, and the performance of individual issuers. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation's and world's capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold, and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks a recession, depression, political or social upheaval, or other development in either the u.s. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize their budgets or economies through austerity programs, tax increases or other measures, to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts investor fear, whether substantiated or not a significant change in inflation expectations or the onset of deflation a default on sovereign debt, or the perception that such a default is likely, and a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary's investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary's ability to write new business. if we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary's capital from the progressive corporation's other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2013, and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. - 23 - iv. credit risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. these include, for example, contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations), agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks or other financial institutions. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which in turn could adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company's ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase its securities. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase its common shares or other securities, or meet its other obligations. each insurance subsidiary's ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, or in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to meet regulatory requirements, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock or other securities, and fund corporate opportunities. management determines our capital needs at any given time based on a number of factors, including: regulatory capital and surplus requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries current and anticipated performance of our insurance operations and investment portfolios growth prospects for our insurance businesses expected significant expenditures and available business opportunities our capital management activities, such as scheduled debt payments, the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares and debt securities, the availability of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process. - 24 - the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. if regulatory requirements for capital and surplus were to increase, we would likely be required to increase the amount of capital that we hold at our insurance subsidiaries. also, if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time, our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained, and our flexibility to pay dividends, repurchase our securities, or engage in other corporate transactions could be limited, until additional sources of capital are secured. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and consumers), potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. in addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels. our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor's, moody's investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction, or allow the other party to liquidate the derivatives transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. the progressive corporation's annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (33-1/3% for 2013 and 2014) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses, and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders' expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2014 (to be paid early in 2015), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2014 or early 2015, and the board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2014 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above under market risks. any such change could adversely affect investors' perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities. - 25 - we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors' expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market ri sk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors progressive's business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks - risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders operating risks - the risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks - changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios, which might result from a variety of factors impacting the investment marketplace generally, or the sectors, industries, or individual securities in which we have invested, and credit and other financial risks - the risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary. in addition, we discuss below certain risks associated with our entering into an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in arx holding corp. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under insurance risks, market risks, and credit risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially. this information is not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. - 14 - i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory actions the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, floods, other severe weather, and terrorist events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claims settlement practices changing vehicle usage and driving patterns, as influenced by oil and gas prices, among other factors advancements in vehicle technology and safety features, such as accident prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations unforeseen disruptive technologies and events, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices. the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. - 15 - our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, for multiple products in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 11 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on august 8, 2014. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools and third-party experts to help estimate our exposures to such events. those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations. ii. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information and other technologies), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. - 16 - our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses, all of which are highly competitive markets. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised. in addition, due to our focus on the auto insurance market, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time. for example, if governmental mandates or restrictions, economic conditions, demographic trends, changing driving patterns, rising gasoline prices, advancements in vehicle technology or safety features, or other factors, were to result in decreased demand for auto insurance or decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period, the automobile insurance market as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired. historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. unexpected increases in the insurers' underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. as the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies, as a result of varying loss cost experiences, trend recognition capabilities, and profitability goals), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for progressive's business prospects at that time. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophic fund, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer's former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term. our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors' initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity, while delivering high quality products and services. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors', then-current or historical modes of doing business, and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. these innovations also may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes, and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk, which makes their implementation a challenge. in addition, our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with, or in reliance on, third-party vendors and their systems, which may further limit our control of implementation, quality, customer experiences, and successful outcomes. our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set. our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition, our business could be materially adversely affected. at the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry and adversely affect our competitive position. these developments can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technological advances, or new ways of doing business, among other initiatives. recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace include: new ways for customers to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, the growth in mobile communications and consumers' desire to transact business on mobile devices, the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers, and the availability of very large volumes of data and the challenges related to analyzing those data sets (sometimes referred to as big data ). our ability to react to such advances, develop and maintain winning strategies, and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success. - 17 - ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. this complexity may create barriers to implementing or defending certain new ideas or providing high-quality products and customer experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies. in addition, we must make difficult decisions regarding the optimal allocation of available resources (such as information technology resources) for competing initiatives or projects. complexity in our industry is compounded by the proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being marketed, sold, and serviced, which may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their patent rights. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us. however, defending our business practices against patent challenges, and enforcing and defending our patent rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, further complicating business plans related to these efforts. if we are unable to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors, our businesses could experience a decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business, poor experiences for customers, substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, the need to modify our business processes, regulatory investigations and sanctions, and damage to our brand. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, enhance consumers' perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market. if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. these situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, systems failures, effects of actual or perceived vulnerabilities to cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), errors in handling a customer's policy, inappropriate handling of claims, misconduct by our officers, directors or employees or others acting on our behalf, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of third-party systems that we use, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by our other business partners, including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance), and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors. moreover, the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technical, analytical, and other skills necessary for us to run our business. our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, employee morale, and brand could be materially adversely affected. - 18 - our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. progressive's insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, privacy, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries' ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries' ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by court-imposed interpretations of those laws or regulations, such as, in recent years, matters concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, procedures for settling claims with our insureds and claimants, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries' ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries' ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in certain cases, revocation of a subsidiary's authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. at this time, we are unable to predict whether any additional state or federal laws or regulations will be enacted as a result of legislative, regulatory or reform efforts, and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive's insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 8 of this report. - 19 - our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization's culture and the effectiveness of its management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the effectiveness of our service center program and other methods of resolving claims. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries' business operations. other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits have recently included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries' use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; policy implementation and renewal procedures; and employment-related litigation, including federal wage and hour claims, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries' business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of other general liability theories. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries' business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices, including how vehicles are repaired and other claims are settled. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of court-imposed regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 - litigation in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. these systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities. such attacks may include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. similarly, an employee, consultant, agent, or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions, or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack, which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and in the loss, corruption, or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees. - 20 - we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party vendors, which may provide software, data storage, communication, and other computer services to us (some of which may be referred to as cloud computing ). these third-party systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches, along with the possible risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of progressive's information or the confidential information of our customers and employees. these relationships present further risk management challenges for us, including, among others: confirming and monitoring the third-party's security measures; the potential for improper handling of or access to, or the inability to retrieve, our data; and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. examples include physical security measures, access and password policies, firewalls, systems monitoring, malicious code protection, network and host-based intrusion detection and prevention measures, data loss prevention measures, configuration assurance, data encryption, and event management, as well as third-party testing. in addition, we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards, and ongoing testing, auditing, and evaluation of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party's systems are adversely affected. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments, such as progressive, must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information. while the pci standards set a high bar for data security, compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis. in september 2014, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes, recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci's data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions. our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks (as discussed above), riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities. likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. - 21 - the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; we could experience service denials if demand for a third party's services exceeds capacity or if a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, resolve and pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill and to our brand. we maintain insurance on our real property and other physical assets, including coverage for losses due to business interruptions caused by covered property damage. however, the insurance will not compensate us for losses that may occur due to disruptions in service as a result of a computer, data processing, or telecommunications systems failure, cyber attack, or other event that is unrelated to covered property damage, nor will the insurance necessarily compensate us for all losses resulting from covered events. to help maintain functionality and reduce the risk of significant interruptions of our operations, we maintain back-up systems or facilities for certain of our systems. in addition, if such a significant interruption occurs or is threatened, we have developed processes designed to maintain certain of our business operations and, if necessary, to recover our systems after such an event has occurred. we still may be exposed, however, should these measures prove to be unsuccessful or inadequate to protect against interruptions of systems where no back-up currently exists or against severe, multiple, or prolonged service interruptions. we have established emergency management teams, which are responsible for responding to business disruptions and other risk events. the teams' ability to respond successfully may be limited depending on the nature of the event, the completeness and effectiveness of our plans to maintain business continuity and recover our systems upon the occurrence of such an event, and other factors beyond our control. we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers. these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house (ach) network; other such networks or payment systems may be developed in the future. our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory authorities. if we fail to comply with legal requirements or a network's rules, we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties, including, in certain cases, the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system. such fines and penalties, and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically, could materially adversely affect our business and our brand. our business is also highly dependent on access to, and the operation of, the financial markets and related facilities to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, also could adversely affect our ability to make timely payments. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. this risk includes the possibility of permanent loss. in the case of governmental issuers, the risk includes the potential for unbalanced budgets, required austerity measures, debt defaults, bankruptcies, or other social or political turmoil. concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. - 22 - prepayment or extension risk - applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions. prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates. liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio's performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by external investment advisory firms. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as energy, technology, or financial services, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital. likewise, the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisors, including sector or industry concentrations, lack of geographic diversification, and the performance of individual issuers. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation's and world's capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold, and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks a recession, depression, political or social upheaval, or other development in either the u.s. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize their budgets or economies through austerity programs, tax increases or other measures, to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts investor fear, whether substantiated or not a significant change in inflation expectations or the onset of deflation a default on sovereign debt, or the perception that such a default is likely, and a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. - 23 - if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary's investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary's ability to write new business. in any such event, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2014, and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iv. credit and other financial risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. these include, for example: contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations); agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer; and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies and the performance of certain state reinsurance facilities/associations relating to extreme events or certain catastrophic claims). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks, other financial institutions, or security clearinghouses. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, obligation, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which in turn could adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay, which in turn may limit the holding company's ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase its securities, or meet its other obligations. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase its common shares or other securities, or meet its other obligations. each insurance subsidiary's ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, and in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. - 24 - if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to meet regulatory requirements, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock or other securities, and fund corporate opportunities. management determines our capital needs at any given time based on a number of factors, including: regulatory capital and surplus requirements applicable to our insurance subsidiaries current and anticipated performance of our insurance operations and investment portfolios growth prospects for our insurance businesses expected significant expenditures and available business opportunities our capital management activities, such as scheduled debt payments, the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares and debt securities, the availability of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process. the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. if regulatory requirements for capital and surplus were to increase, we likely would be required to increase the amount of capital held by our insurance subsidiaries. also, if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time, our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained, and our flexibility to pay dividends, repurchase our securities, or engage in other corporate transactions could be limited, until additional sources of capital are secured. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and consumers), potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. in addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels. our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor's, moody's investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction, or allow the other party to liquidate the derivatives transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. - 25 - the progressive corporation's annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (33-1/3% for 2014 and 2015) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses, and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders' expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2015 (to be paid early in 2016), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2015 or early 2016, and the board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2015 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above under market risks. any such change could adversely affect investors' perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which, at times, may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors' expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. v. risks associated with the arx transaction the anticipated acquisition of control of arx holding corp. may not occur or may occur on terms different than those initially contemplated. it is possible that the contemplated acquisition of arx capital stock may not occur because the conditions to the closing of the transaction are not satisfied or for another reason. in addition, there is a risk that the transactions may not be consummated on the terms contemplated, as a result of changed circumstances or because of requirements imposed by insurance or other regulatory authorities. - 26 - if the anticipated acquisition is consummated, it may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company and may present new operational or other risks for us. if the acquisition is consummated, it may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company, or such benefits may be delayed longer than anticipated, and arx may not perform as expected, may have unknown liabilities and may present unanticipated operational or other risks. arx will continue to be, and the company will become, dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of arx's officers and key employees to execute their business plans. in addition, the homeowners insurance business differs from our current business in certain respects. catastrophe losses, including those caused by adverse weather conditions (including hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and severe storms), may impact homeowners insurance results more than they impact our current results. further, like many homeowners insurance companies, arx relies on reinsurance contracts to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events. nonetheless, arx remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured and is subject to credit risk with respect to its ability to recover from reinsurers for the claims it paid. our consolidated debt is expected to increase as a result of the acquisition and our debt rating may be adversely affected. as of december 31, 2014, arx had outstanding external borrowings of $191.3 million, a significant portion of which is secured by the stock of certain of arx's key subsidiaries. this debt will remain outstanding after the acquisition, and it is possible that our debt rating could be adversely affected as a result, which may reduce our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, adversely affect our ability to access the debt markets, and increase our interest expense on any future indebtedness. the anticipated acquisition will affect our accounting and the comparability of our results. if the acquisition is consummated, the financial results of arx and its subsidiaries will be consolidated in our financial results. reporting the results of a writer of homeowners insurance may introduce additional volatility in our consolidated results, particularly because we report our results on a monthly basis. in addition, because we will own less than one hundred percent of arx for some period of time, the other holders of arx capital stock will have an interest in the assets and operating results of arx, and their interests will be reflected on our financial statements. these changes will introduce more complexity to our financial statements and may affect the ability of investors or analysts to assess our financial results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks - risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders operating risks - risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks - risks that may cause changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios, and credit and other financial risks - the risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing, and financing activities, which are addressed separately under insurance risks, market risks, and credit and other financial risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, home ownership trends, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur. also, to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country, general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business. we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may develop into actual events and impact our businesses. if any one or more of them does so, the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. - 14 - i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory actions the frequency and severity of catastrophe events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claims settlement practices changing vehicle usage and driving patterns, which may be influenced by oil and gas prices, the emerging sharing economy, or residential occupancy patterns, among other factors advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features, such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations unforeseen disruptive technologies and events, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, used car prices, or construction labor and materials costs. the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. - 15 - our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, for multiple products in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical costs, auto repair costs, or the costs of construction labor and materials unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined for different categories of claims. the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 11 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which primarily discusses our vehicle business reserves and was filed with the sec on form 8-k on august 26, 2015. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or by other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the frequency and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause. catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools and third-party experts to help estimate our exposure to such events. those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs, obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our homeowners and other businesses at reasonable cost, and collect under our reinsurance contracts. like many homeowners insurance companies, our property business relies on reinsurance contracts, state reinsurance funding, and catastrophe bonds (collectively, reinsurance arrangements ) to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events and its aggregate exposure to certain other severe storms. we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses. reinsurance arrangements are often subject to an aggregate dollar coverage limit, so if a significant catastrophe or other events are covered by reinsurance, our claims liabilities arising from those events may - 16 - exceed our reinsurance coverage. in addition, although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage, the original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result, we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay, or will dispute, reinsurance claims. further, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions (which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events). we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. the availability and cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume, profitability, or financial condition. ii. operating risks we compete in property-casualty markets that are highly competitive. we write insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles, commercial autos and trucks for small businesses, and homeowners, renters, and commercial property owners. all of these markets are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, operational effectiveness, pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised. in addition, because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to, and more adversely affected by, trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time. historically, the auto and property insurance markets have been known as cyclical, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. as insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophe fund, our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs. we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer's former policyholders. such events could materially adversely affect our financial results, brand, and future business prospects. our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors' initiatives. our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with the systems of third parties. as a result, if we do not handle these transitions effectively and efficiently, the quality of our products, our relationships with our customers and agents, and our business prospects, may be materially adversely affected. in addition, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations, our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected. - 17 - we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences. ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, informational, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. these risks include our increasing reliance on third-party systems, the development of new modes of communication, changing insurance shopping trends, and the availability of very large volumes of data (i.e., big data) and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets. complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer and agent experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to the increased difficulty in executing our business strategies. intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations. there has been a proliferation of patents, both inside and outside the insurance industry, that significantly impacts our businesses. the existence of such patents, and other claimed intellectual property rights, may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights. such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings, substantial monetary damages, or expensive changes in our business processes and practices. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us. however, we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices, and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges, and enforcing and defending our rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, which can further complicate business plans. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a cost-effective manner, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, customer retention, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, enhance perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market. if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us, whether due to our business practices, the conduct of our officers or employees, the actions of businesses with which we do business, including unaffiliated insurers through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners), or other causes. the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technological, analytical, and other skills and know-how necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses. our loss of certain officers and key employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing or under-staffing in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, employee morale, and brand could be materially adversely affected. - 18 - our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. in such events, the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, privacy, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries' ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries' ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries' ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries' ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, and dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in certain cases, revocation of a subsidiary's authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 7 of this report. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries' business operations. additional litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries' use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges relating to our network of repair facilities or our service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; policy implementation and renewal procedures; and employment-related litigation, including federal wage and hour claims, among other matters. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of other general liability theories. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries' business operations. - 19 - lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 - litigation in the annual report. our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. all of these systems are subject to cyber attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. such attacks or actions may include attempts to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. some of our systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. this approach may increase the risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack. third-party risks may include, among other factors, lax third-party's security measures, data location uncertainty, and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. in addition, we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards, and review of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. therefore, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers. these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house (ach) network. our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups. if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group, including those related to data security, we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties, including, in certain cases, the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system. such fines and penalties, and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically, could materially adversely affect our business and our brand. - 20 - our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions. our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; an interruption of service from a third party for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions. if sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies, provide customer service, resolve claims in a timely manner, make payments when required, or perform other necessary business functions. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects, as well as damage to our brand and customer goodwill. the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company and our goodwill or intangible assets may become impaired. the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to us, or such benefits may be delayed longer than anticipated. at the time of the arx acquisition, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets at fair value. goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, while other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. valuing these assets, and evaluating their recoverability, requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity, margins, growth rates, discount rates, and other matters, and our estimates may change over time, potentially resulting in write-downs of the assets. goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results, divestitures or sustained market declines, among other factors, and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio consists principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income, or result in realized or unrealized investment losses. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk - applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions, prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates. liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio's performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we hold; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. - 21 - the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification. the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation's and world's capital markets. any disruption in the functioning of those markets or our ability to liquidate investments when desired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. in addition, if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary's investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary's ability to write new business. in any such event, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2015, and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iv. credit and other financial risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. these include, for example: agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance arrangements used by us, our corporate insurance policies, and the performance of state reinsurance facilities/associations). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks, other financial institutions, or security clearinghouses. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, obligation, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay, which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase securities, or meet other obligations. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions, or are able to pay only limited amounts, the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to its shareholders, or meet its other obligations. each insurance subsidiary's ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, and in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. - 22 - in addition, under the arx stockholders' agreement, arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and other specified arx stockholders. further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors. these could include increased regulatory requirements, losses in our insurance or investment operations, or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write, among others. if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed, whether due to our results, volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control, or other reasons, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in such an event, unless and until additional sources of capital are secured, we may be limited in our ability, or unable, to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, grow our business, pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators, potentially resulting in regulatory actions, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. our access to capital markets, ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor's, moody's investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. our annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (33-1/3% for 2015 and 2016) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our gainsharing (cash bonus) plans for most of our employees and based on the operating performance of our vehicle insurance businesses). if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes the change in unrealized investment gains and losses, among other items) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders' expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2016 (to be paid early in 2017), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2016 or early 2017, and the board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2016 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above under market risks. any such change could adversely affect investors' perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which, at times, may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors' expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. the addition of our property business, - 23 - which includes the results of our homeowners business, beginning in april 2015, may introduce additional volatility in our consolidated results compared to prior periods. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks - risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders operating risks - risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks - risks that may cause changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios, and credit and other financial risks - risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing, and financing activities, which are addressed separately under insurance risks, market risks, and credit and other financial risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, home ownership trends, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur. also, to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country, general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business. we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may develop into actual events and impact our businesses. if any one or more of them does so, the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. - 11 - pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents, other insured events, and associated losses, and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events, loss costs, expenses, and inflation, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory actions the frequency and severity of catastrophe events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claims settlement practices changing vehicle usage and driving patterns, which may be influenced by oil and gas prices among other factors, changes in residential occupancy patterns, and the emerging sharing economy advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features, such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations unforeseen disruptive technologies and events, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, used car prices, or construction requirements or labor and materials costs. the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. - 12 - our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, for multiple products in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical costs, auto repair costs, or the costs of construction labor and materials unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined for different categories of claims, and the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. further information on our loss reserves can be found in note 6 - loss and loss adjustment expense reserves in our annual report. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or by other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the frequency and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause. catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events. those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs, obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our homeowners and other businesses at reasonable cost, and collect under our reinsurance contracts. like many homeowners insurance companies, our property business relies on reinsurance contracts, state reinsurance funding, and catastrophe bonds (collectively, reinsurance arrangements ) to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events. we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses. reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply, so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event, and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit, so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage. in addition, although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage, the original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result, we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay, or will dispute, reinsurance claims. further, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions (which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events). we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. the availability and cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume, profitability, or financial condition. - 13 - ii. operating risks we compete in property-casualty markets that are highly competitive. we write insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles, commercial autos and trucks for small businesses, homeowners, and renters. all of these markets are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of our competitors have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, operational effectiveness, pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised. in addition, because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to, and more adversely affected by, trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time, such as advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicle sharing arrangements. historically, the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. as insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophe fund, our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs. we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer's former policyholders. such events could materially adversely affect our financial results, brand, and future business prospects. our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors' initiatives. our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties. as a result, if we do not handle these transitions effectively and efficiently, the quality of our products, our relationships with our customers and agents, and our business prospects, may be materially adversely affected. in addition, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations, our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected. we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences. ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, informational, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. these risks include our increasing reliance on third-party systems, the development of new modes of communication, changing insurance shopping trends, and the availability of very large volumes of data (i.e., big data) and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets. complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer and agent experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies. - 14 - intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations. there has been a proliferation of patents, both inside and outside the insurance industry, that significantly impacts our businesses. the existence of such patents, and other claimed intellectual property rights, may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights. such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings, substantial monetary damages, or expensive changes in our business processes and practices. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us. however, we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices, and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges, and enforcing and defending our rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, which can further complicate business plans. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a cost-effective manner, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, customer retention, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, enhance perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market. if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us, whether due to our business practices, the conduct of our officers or employees, the actions of businesses with which we do business, including unaffiliated insurers through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance), or other causes. the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technological, analytical, and other skills and know-how necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses. our loss of certain officers and key employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented employees, executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing or under-staffing in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, employee morale, and brand could be materially adversely affected. our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. in such events, the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. - 15 - we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, privacy, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries' ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries' ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries' ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries' ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, and dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in certain cases, revocation of a subsidiary's authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion included in this report. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries' business operations. additional litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries' use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims or for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicare beneficiaries; other claims handling procedures; challenges relating to our network of repair facilities or our service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; policy implementation and renewal procedures; and employment-related litigation, including federal wage and hour claims, among other matters. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning allegations of other general liability theories. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries' business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. for further information on the risks of pending litigation, see note 12 litigation in the annual report. - 16 - our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. all of these systems are subject to cyber attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. such attacks or actions may include attempts to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data or the personal information of our customers or employees misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. some of our systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. this approach may increase the risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack. third-party risks may include, among other factors, the vendor's lax security measures, data location uncertainty, and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. in addition, we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards, and review of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. therefore, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers. these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house (ach) network. our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups. if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group, including those related to data security, we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties, including, in certain cases, the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system. such fines and penalties, and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically, could materially adversely affect our business and our brand. - 17 - our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions. our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; an interruption of service from a third-party system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions. if sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies, provide customer service, resolve claims in a timely manner, make payments when required, or perform other necessary business functions. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects, as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill. the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to the company, and our goodwill or intangible assets may become impaired. the arx acquisition may not produce the anticipated benefits to us, or such benefits may be delayed longer than anticipated. in addition, as we identify opportunities for integration of arx's products, employees, operations or systems with our own, we may be unable to execute on such opportunities and generate the benefits identified, the costs of those efforts may be greater than expected, or those efforts may cause difficulties or unintended consequences that could adversely impact our operations and results. at the time of the arx acquisition, we recorded goodwill and intangible assets at fair value. we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. valuing these assets, and evaluating their recoverability, requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity, margins, growth rates, discount rates, and other matters, and our estimates may change over time, potentially resulting in write-downs of the assets. goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results, divestitures or sustained market declines, among other factors, and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio consists principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income, or result in realized or unrealized investment losses. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk - applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions, prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates. liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio's performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: - 18 - there is a deterioration in the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we hold; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification. the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation's and world's capital markets. any disruption in the functioning of those markets or our ability to liquidate investments when desired could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. in addition, if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary's investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary's ability to write new business. in any such event, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2016, and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio. iv. credit and other financial risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. these include, for example: agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance arrangements used by us, our corporate insurance policies, and the performance of state reinsurance facilities/associations). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks, other financial institutions, or security clearinghouses. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, obligation, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay, which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase securities, or meet other obligations. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions, or are able to pay only limited amounts, the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to its shareholders, or meet its other obligations. each insurance subsidiary's ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, and - 19 - in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. in addition, under the arx stockholders' agreement, arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and other specified arx stockholders. further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors. these could include increased regulatory requirements, losses in our insurance or investment operations, or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write, among others. if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed, whether due to our results, volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control, or other reasons, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in such an event, unless and until additional sources of capital are secured, we may be limited in our ability, or unable, to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, grow our business, pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators, potentially resulting in regulatory actions, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. our access to capital markets, ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor's, moody's investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. our annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (33-1/3% for 2016 and 2017) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our gainsharing (cash bonus) plans for most of our employees and based on the operating performance of our vehicle insurance businesses for 2016, and our vehicle and our property businesses, with minor exclusions, for 2017). if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes the change in unrealized investment gains and losses, among other items) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders' expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2017 (to be paid early in 2018), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2017 or early 2018, and the board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2017 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above under market risks. any such change could adversely affect investors' perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares. - 20 - our investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate the anticipated returns. we invest in certain projects that are entitled to tax-advantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law, including renewable energy development, historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing, and we may make other tax-advantaged investments from time to time. our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and, in some cases, through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project. certain of these investments are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied. many of the factors that could lead to a challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control. the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which, at times, may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors' expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. the addition of our property business, which includes the results of our homeowners business, beginning in april 2015, may introduce additional volatility in our consolidated results compared to prior periods. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above, and from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report.risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks - risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders operating risks - risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks - risks that may cause changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios liquidity risk - risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral, or other financial obligations, and credit and other financial risks - risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing, and financing activities, which are addressed separately under insurance risks, market risks, and credit and other financial risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, home ownership trends, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur. also, to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country, general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business. we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may develop into actual events and impact our businesses. if any one or more of them does so, the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. - 12 - pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents, other insured events, and associated losses, and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events, loss costs, expenses, and inflation, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy our ability to reflect changes in reinsurance costs in a timely manner the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory actions the frequency and severity of catastrophe events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices changing vehicle usage and driving patterns, which may be influenced by oil and gas prices among other factors, changes in residential occupancy patterns, and the emerging sharing economy advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features, such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations unforeseen disruptive technologies and events, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, used car prices, or construction requirements or labor and materials costs. the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. - 13 - our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, for multiple products in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical costs, auto repair costs, or the costs of construction labor and materials unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined for different categories of claims. the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion of this report. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or by other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the frequency and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause. catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events. those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs, obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost, and collect under our reinsurance contracts. our property business relies on reinsurance contracts, state reinsurance funding, and catastrophe bonds (collectively, reinsurance arrangements ) to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events. we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses. reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply, so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event, and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit, so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage. in addition, although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage, the original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result, we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay, or will dispute, reinsurance claims. further, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions (which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events, such as catastrophes). we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. the unavailability and/or cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume, profitability, or financial condition. - 14 - ii. operating risks we compete in property-casualty markets that are highly competitive. we write insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles, homeowners and renters, and commercial autos and trucks for small businesses. all of these markets are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other companies, potentially including existing insurance companies, other well-financed companies seeking new opportunities, or new competitors with technological or other innovations, also may enter these markets in the future. many of our competitors have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, operational effectiveness, pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised. in addition, because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to, and more adversely affected by, trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time, such as advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicle sharing arrangements. historically, the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. as insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophe fund, our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs. we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer's former policyholders. such events could materially adversely affect our financial results, brand, and future business prospects. our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors' initiatives. our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties. as a result, if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed, the quality of our products, our relationships with our customers and agents, and our business prospects, may be materially adversely affected. in addition, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis, our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected. we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences. ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, informational, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. these risks include our increasing reliance on third-party systems, the development of new modes of communication, changing insurance shopping trends, and the availability of very large volumes of data (i.e., big data) and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets. complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer and agent experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies. - 15 - intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations. there has been a proliferation of patents, both inside and outside the insurance industry, that significantly impacts our businesses. the existence of such patents, and other claimed intellectual property rights, may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights. such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings, substantial monetary damages, or expensive changes in our business processes and practices. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us. however, we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices, and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges, and enforcing and defending our rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, which can further complicate business plans. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a cost-effective manner, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, customer retention, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, enhance perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market. if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us, whether due to our business practices, the conduct of our officers or employees, the actions of businesses with which we do business, including unaffiliated insurers whose products we offer or make available to our customers, or other causes. the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technological, analytical, and other skills and know-how necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses. our loss of certain officers and key employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented employees, executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing or under-staffing in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, employee morale, and brand could be materially adversely affected. our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. in such events, the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. - 16 - we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, privacy, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries' ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries' ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, an insurer's ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs, restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold, and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs for us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in certain cases, revocation of a subsidiary's authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion of this report. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries' business operations. these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries' methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims or for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicare/medicaid beneficiaries; other claims handling procedures, including challenges relating to our network of repair facilities, our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles, our subrogation practices, and our handling of diminution of value claims; assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; policy sales, implementation and renewal practices and procedures; and employment-related litigation, including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices, among other matters. additional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries' business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. - 17 - litigation is inherently unpredictable. adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. for further information on the risks of pending litigation, see note 12 litigation in the annual report. our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. all of these systems are subject to cyber attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. such attacks or actions may include attempts to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data, or the personal information of our customers or employees misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. some of our systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. this approach may increase the risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack. third-party risks may include, among other factors, the vendor's lax security measures, data location uncertainty, and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. in addition, we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards, and review of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, our systems are being threatened on a regular basis, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. therefore, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers. these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house (ach) network. our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups. if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group, including those related to data security, we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties, including, in certain cases, the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system. such fines and penalties, and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically, could materially adversely affect our business and our brand. - 18 - our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions and the operation of various third-party systems. our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; an interruption of service from a third-party system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions. if sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies, provide customer service, resolve claims in a timely manner, make payments when required, or perform other necessary business functions. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects, as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill. we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements. as a result of business acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill (generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired) and certain intangible assets (at fair value at the time of acquisition). we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. valuing these assets, and evaluating their recoverability, requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity, margins, growth rates, discount rates, and other matters, and our estimates may change over time, potentially resulting in write-downs of the assets. goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results, divestitures or sustained market declines, among other factors, and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio consists principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income, or result in realized or unrealized investment losses. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk - applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions, prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates. liquidity risk - discussed separately below. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio's performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. - 19 - the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification. the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, our financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary's investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary's ability to write new business. in any such event, our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2017, and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio. iv. liquidity risk the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business. we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business. if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed, whether due to our own systems difficulties, an institution-specific issue at the bank or financial institution (such as a cybersecurity breach), a broader disruption in banking, financial or wire transfer systems, or otherwise, our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our business could be adversely affected. likewise, our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation's and world's capital markets. any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired, could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due. any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties, reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. v. credit and other financial risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business under certain government programs become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs. these include, for example: agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise, arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance arrangements used by us, our corporate insurance policies, and the performance of state reinsurance facilities/associations), and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs, such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program. in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks, other financial institutions, or security clearinghouses. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or programs or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, obligation, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. - 20 - our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay, which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase securities, or meet other obligations. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions, or are able to pay only limited amounts, the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to its shareholders, or meet its other obligations. each insurance subsidiary's ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, and in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. in addition, under the arx stockholders' agreement, arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and other specified arx stockholders. further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c) , dividends, of this report. if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors. these could include increased regulatory requirements, losses in our insurance or investment operations, or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write, among others. if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed, whether due to our results, volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control, or other reasons, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in such an event, unless and until additional sources of capital are secured, we may be limited in our ability, or unable, to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, grow our business, pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators, potentially resulting in regulatory actions, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. our access to capital markets, ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor's, moody's investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. our annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (33-1/3% for 2017 and 2018) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our gainsharing (annual cash incentive) plans for most of our employees and based on the operating performance of our insurance businesses). if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes the change in unrealized investment gains and losses, among other items) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. - 21 - because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders' expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual variable dividend in 2018 (to be paid early in 2019), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2018 or early 2019, and the board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2018 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above. any such change could adversely affect investors' perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares. our investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate the anticipated returns. we may invest in certain projects that are entitled to tax-advantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law, including renewable energy development, historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing, and we may make other tax-advantaged investments from time to time. our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and, in some cases, through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project. certain of these investments are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied. many of the factors that could lead to a challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control. the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which, at times, may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors' expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. - 22 - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above, and from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report.risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks - risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders operating risks - risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks - risks that may cause changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios liquidity risk - risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral, or other financial obligations, and credit and other financial risks - risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing, and financing activities, which are addressed separately under insurance risks, market risks, and credit and other financial risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, technological advances, home ownership trends, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur. also, to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country, general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business. we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may develop into actual events and impact our businesses. if any one or more of them does so, the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, and the market prices of our common shares or debt securities could decline. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. - 12 - pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents, other insured events, and associated losses, and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events, loss costs, expenses, and inflation, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy our ability to reflect changes in reinsurance costs in a timely manner the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory actions the frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of catastrophe events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices changing vehicle usage and driving patterns, which may be influenced by oil and gas prices among other factors, changes in residential occupancy patterns, and the emerging sharing economy advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features, such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations unforeseen disruptive technologies and events, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, used car prices, or construction requirements or labor and materials costs. the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. - 13 - our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, for multiple products in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical costs, auto repair costs, or the costs of construction labor and materials unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined for different categories of claims. the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophe events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or by other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur, how long they last, and how much insured damage they cause, and may change where the events occur. catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature, severity, and duration of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events. those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency, severity or duration, or unanticipated changes in geographic location or scope, of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs, obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost, and collect under our reinsurance contracts. our property business relies on reinsurance contracts, state reinsurance funding, and catastrophe bonds (collectively, reinsurance arrangements ) to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events. we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines and umbrella insurance businesses. reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply, so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event, and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit, so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage. in addition, although the reinsurer is liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage, the - 14 - original insurer remains liable under the policies to the insured as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. as a result, we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay, or will dispute, reinsurance claims. further, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions (which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events, such as catastrophes). we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. the unavailability and/or cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume, profitability, or financial condition. ii. operating risks we compete in property-casualty markets that are highly competitive. the markets in which we sell insurance are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other companies, potentially including existing insurance companies, other well-financed companies seeking new opportunities, or new competitors with technological or other innovations, also may enter these markets in the future. many of our competitors have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, innovation, operational effectiveness, pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised. in addition, because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to, and more adversely affected by, trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time, such as advances in autonomous vehicles and vehicle sharing arrangements. historically, the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. as insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot be certain whether and to what extent such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto or property insurance markets, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophe fund, our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs. we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer's former policyholders. such events could materially adversely affect our financial results, brand, and future business prospects. our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors' initiatives. our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties. as a result, if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed, the quality of our products, our relationships with our customers and agents, and our business prospects, may be materially adversely affected. in addition, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis, our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected. - 15 - we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences. ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, informational, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. these risks include our increasing reliance on third-party systems, the development of new modes of communication, changing insurance shopping trends, and the availability of very large volumes of data (i.e., big data) and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets. complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer and agent experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies. intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations. there has been a proliferation of patents, both inside and outside the insurance industry, that significantly impacts our businesses. the existence of such patents, and other claimed intellectual property rights, may result in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights. such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings, substantial monetary damages, or expensive changes in our business processes and practices. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us. however, we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices, and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges, and enforcing and defending our rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, which can further complicate business plans. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a cost-effective manner, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, customer retention, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, enhance perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market. if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand also could be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on us, whether due to our business practices, the conduct of our officers or employees, the actions of businesses with which we do business, including unaffiliated insurers whose products we offer or make available to our customers, or other causes. the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent, including employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technological, analytical, and other skills and know-how necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses and assess potential expansion into new products and business areas. our loss of certain officers and key employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented employees, executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and staffing levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing or under-staffing in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, employee morale, and brand could be materially adversely affected. we use third-party labor to meet a portion of our staffing needs. any significant loss in access to qualified external talent on a cost-effective basis could have an adverse effect on our business. - 16 - our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. in such events, the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, methods of customer communications, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries' ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries' ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, an insurer's ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs, restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold, and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs for us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including potentially material assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. in addition, data privacy and security regulations impose complex compliance and reporting requirements and challenges. for example, california recently enacted consumer privacy protection legislation that will become effective in 2020. compliance with this new legislation will be challenging as it will require us to modify our current business systems and operations in a short time frame and without the benefit of related regulations, which are not required to be issued until six months after the legislation's effective date. other states are considering privacy and security legislation, and variations in requirements across the states present ongoing compliance challenges. compliance with these laws and regulations may result in increased costs, which may be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in certain jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in certain cases, revocation of a subsidiary's authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries' business operations. these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries' methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims or for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicare/medicaid beneficiaries; other claims handling procedures, including challenges relating to our network of repair facilities, our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles - 17 - for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles, our payment of fees and taxes, our subrogation practices, and our handling of diminution of value claims; our assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; rating practices; certain policy sales, services, implementation and renewal practices and procedures, including with respect to accessibility; our snapshot program; certain relationships with independent insurance agents; and certain employment practices, including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices, among other matters.additional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries' business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. for further information on the risks of pending litigation, see note 12 - litigation in the annual report. our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. all of these systems are subject to cyber attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. such attacks or actions may include attempts to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data, or the personal information of our customers or employees misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. some of our systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. this approach may increase the risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack. third-party risks may include, among other factors, the vendor's lax security measures, data location uncertainty, and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. in addition, we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards, and review of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, our systems are being threatened on a regular basis, we have experienced minor incidents in the past, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing future attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. therefore, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. - 18 - our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions and the operation of various third-party systems. our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; an interruption of service from a third-party system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions. if sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies, provide customer service, resolve claims in a timely manner, make payments when required, or perform other necessary business functions. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects, as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill. efforts to develop new products or enter new areas of business may not be successful and may create enhanced risks. we are developing, and may develop in the future, new insurance products, including those that insure risks that we have not previously insured, contain new coverages, or change coverage terms. these new products may not be as profitable as our existing products and may not perform as well as we expect. in addition, these new products may change our risk exposures, and the business systems, data, and models we use to manage those exposures may be less accurate or less effective than those we use with existing products. in addition, we are evaluating other business models, both insurance and non-insurance related, and are considering investments in different business areas. these activities may take the form of internal development, equity investments, targeted mergers or acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic partnerships. these new ventures may require us to make significant expenditures, which may negatively impact our results in the near term, and if not successful, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. while at the onset of the venture we would expect these projects to provide long-term value, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized. if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers. these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house (ach) network. our ability to participate in these networks is dependent on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups. if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group, including those related to data security, we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties, including, in certain cases, the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system. such fines and penalties, and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically, could materially adversely affect our business and our brand. we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements. as a result of business acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill (generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired) and certain intangible assets (at fair value at the time of acquisition) and we may record additional goodwill and intangible assets in the future. we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. valuing these assets, and evaluating their recoverability, requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity, margins, growth rates, discount rates, and other matters, and our estimates may change over time, potentially resulting in write-downs of the assets. goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results, divestitures or sustained market declines, among other factors, and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio consists principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income, or result in realized or unrealized investment losses. - 19 - our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk - applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions, prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates. liquidity risk - discussed separately below. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio's performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. the common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by an external investment advisor. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification. the actively managed equity portfolio is also subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, our financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary's investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary's ability to write new business. in any such event, our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained. see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2017, and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio. iv. liquidity risk the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business. we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business. if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed, whether due to our own systems difficulties, an institution-specific issue at the bank or financial institution (such as a cybersecurity breach), a broader disruption in banking, financial or wire transfer systems, or otherwise, our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our - 20 - business could be materially adversely affected. likewise, our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation's and world's capital markets. any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired, could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due. any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties, reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. v. credit and other financial risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business (including under certain government programs) become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs. these include, for example, agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance arrangements used by us, our corporate insurance policies, and the performance of state reinsurance facilities/associations), and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs, such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program. in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks, other financial institutions, or security clearinghouses. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or programs or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, obligation, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay, which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase securities, or meet other obligations. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions, or are able to pay only limited amounts, the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to its shareholders, or meet its other obligations. each insurance subsidiary's ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, and in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. in addition, under the arx stockholders' agreement, arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and another specified arx stockholder. if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors. these could include increased regulatory requirements, losses in our insurance or investment operations, or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write, among others. if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed, whether due to our results, volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control, or other reasons, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in such an event, unless and until additional sources of capital are secured, we may be limited in our ability, or unable, to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, grow our business, pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators, potentially resulting in regulatory actions, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. - 21 - our access to capital markets, ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor's, moody's investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. our dividend policy may result in varying amounts being paid to shareholders, or no payment in some periods, and the dividend policy ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on a quarterly basis and to consider paying a variable dividend on at least an annual basis. the amount of dividends, if any, may vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in preceding periods. in addition, the board retains the discretion to alter our policy or not to pay dividends at any time. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above. any such change could adversely affect investors' perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares. our investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate the anticipated returns. we may invest in certain projects that are entitled to tax-advantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law, including renewable energy development, historic property rehabilitation and affordable housing, and we may make other tax-advantaged investments from time to time. our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and, in some cases, through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project. certain of these investments are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied. many of the factors that could lead to a challenge or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control. the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which, at times, may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of any dividend that may be paid. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors' expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the payment of dividends, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. - 22 - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above, and from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report.risk factors our business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into five broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks - risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses or liabilities incurred by policyholders operating risks - risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks - risks that may cause changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios liquidity risk - risk that our financial condition will be adversely affected by the inability to meet our short-term cash, collateral, or other financial obligations, and credit and other financial risks - risks that the other party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract, or that we will be unable to satisfy our obligations when due or obtain capital when necessary. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our underwriting, investing, and financing activities, which are addressed separately under insurance risks, market risks, and credit and other financial risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, technological advances, home ownership trends, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses and the costs that we incur. also, to the extent that we have a concentration of business in one or more states or regions of the country, general economic conditions in those states or regions may have a greater impact on our business. we cannot predict whether the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may develop into actual events and impact our businesses. if any one or more of them does so, the events could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations, and the market prices of our equity or debt securities could decline. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite and price risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. - 11 - pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical data regarding vehicle accidents, other insured events, and associated losses, and the projection of future trends for such accidents and events, loss costs, expenses, and inflation, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trends and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy our ability to reflect changes in reinsurance costs in a timely manner the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory actions the frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of catastrophe events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices changing vehicle usage and driving patterns, which may be influenced by oil and gas prices among other factors, changes in residential occupancy patterns, and the emerging sharing economy advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features, such as accident and loss prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations unforeseen disruptive technologies and events, the ability to understand the risk profile of significant customers, such as transportation network companies, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, used car prices, or construction requirements or labor and materials costs, or the imposition and impacts of tariffs. the realization of one or more of these risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. - 12 - our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate as of the date of the financial statements of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, for multiple products in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical costs, auto repair costs, or the costs of construction labor and materials, and the imposition and impacts of tariffs unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of our estimates of loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined for different categories of claims. the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather or other catastrophe events, and changing climate conditions may be exacerbating these impacts. our insurance operating results could be materially adversely affected by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or by other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, epidemics, pandemics, riots, and hazardous material releases. the frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to global climate change or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur, how long they last, and how much insured damage they cause, and may change where the events occur. catastrophe losses may adversely affect the results of our property segment more than they affect the results of our other businesses. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe event is a function of our total insured exposure in the area affected by the event, the nature, severity, and duration of the event, and the extent of reinsurance that we have obtained with respect to such an event. we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposure to such events. those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability and predictive value, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency, severity or duration, or unanticipated changes in geographic location or scope, of catastrophes could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs, obtain sufficient reinsurance coverage for our property and other businesses at reasonable cost, and collect under our reinsurance contracts. our property business relies on reinsurance contracts, state reinsurance funding, and catastrophe bonds (collectively, reinsurance arrangements ) to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events. we also use reinsurance contracts to reinsure portions of our commercial lines businesses, including the transportation network company business, and our umbrella insurance business. reinsurance arrangements are often subject to a threshold below which reinsurance does not apply, so that we are responsible for all losses below the threshold from a covered event, and to an aggregate dollar coverage limit, so that our claims liabilities arising from a covered event may exceed our reinsurance coverage. in addition, although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance coverage, we remain liable under our policies to the insured as the direct insurer on - 13 - all risks reinsured. as a result, we are subject to the risk that reinsurers will be unable to pay, or will dispute, our reinsurance claims. further, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions, which have been and in the future could be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events, such as catastrophes. we may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all. the unavailability and/or cost of reinsurance could adversely affect our business volume, profitability, or financial condition. ii. operating risks we compete in property-casualty markets that are highly competitive. the markets in which we sell insurance are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other companies, potentially including existing insurance companies, vehicle manufacturing companies, other well-financed companies seeking new opportunities, or new competitors with technological or other innovations, also have entered these markets and may continue to do so in the future. many of our competitors have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the property and casualty insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, innovation, operational effectiveness, pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, are permitted to offer their products under different legal and regulatory constraints than those that apply to us, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be compromised. in addition, because auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to, and more adversely affected by, trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time, such as advances in vehicle technology, autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, or vehicle sharing arrangements. we expect similar, and perhaps greater, competitive pressures with respect to any new insurance or non-insurance businesses that we decide to enter in the future. in such cases, we would be selling products or services that are new to us, while our competitors could include large, well-financed companies with significant product and marketing experience in such businesses. historically, the auto and property insurance markets have been described as cyclical, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. as insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profitability to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. the ability to discern at any point in time whether we are in a hard or soft market is often difficult, as such a conclusion represents an assessment of innumerable data points including, among others, the operating results of, and the dynamic competitive actions taken by, us and many competitors in multiple markets involving a variety of products. often detailed information on our competitors becomes available on a delayed basis, and the nature of the market becomes apparent only in retrospect. our ability to predict future competitive conditions is also constrained as a result. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in consolidation within the industry, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of insurance business in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly increase the level of competition in a manner that is not favorable to us. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophe fund, our company and other insurance companies may be required by law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, resulting in a potentially significant increase in our costs. we might also be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer's former policyholders. such events could materially adversely affect our financial results, brand, and future business prospects. our success depends on our ability to innovate effectively and respond to our competitors' initiatives. our ability to develop and implement innovative products and services that are accepted and valued by our customers and independent agents is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive position. innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems of third parties. as a result, if we do not handle these transitions effectively and bring such innovations to market with the requisite speed, the quality of our products, our relationships with our customers and agents, and our business prospects, may be materially adversely affected. in addition, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. if we fail to respond appropriately to those innovations on a timely basis, our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected. - 14 - we must effectively manage complexity as we develop and deliver high quality products and customer experiences. ongoing competitive, technological, regulatory, informational, and other developments result in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our businesses. these risks include our increasing reliance on third-party systems, the development of new modes of communication, changing insurance shopping trends, our understanding of the operations and needs of significant customers, and the availability of very large volumes of data (i.e., big data) and the challenges relating to analyzing those data sets. complexity may create barriers to innovation or the provision of high-quality products and customer and agent experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, to adopt new systems, or to upgrade or replace outdated systems, each at significant expense, and may lead to increased difficulty in executing our business strategies. intellectual property rights could affect our competitiveness and our business operations. there has been a proliferation of patents, both inside and outside the insurance industry, that significantly impacts our businesses. the existence of such patents, and other claimed intellectual property rights, from time to time has resulted in legal challenges to certain of our business practices by other insurance companies and non-insurance entities alleging that we are violating their rights. such legal challenges could result in costly legal proceedings, substantial monetary damages, or expensive changes in our business processes and practices. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us. however, we may not be able to obtain patents on these processes and practices, and defending our patents and other intellectual property rights against challenges, and enforcing and defending our rights, including if necessary through litigation, can be time consuming and expensive, and the results are inherently uncertain, which can further complicate business plans. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately and in a cost-effective manner, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, customer retention, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. we must maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. we have made significant investments in our brand over many years, and we believe it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to maintain and improve brand recognition, enhance perceptions of us, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that maintaining and improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the insurance market. if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand also could be adversely affected by situations that reflect negatively on us, whether due to our business practices, adverse financial developments, perceptions of our corporate governance or social responsibility, the conduct of our officers or employees, the actions of a significant customer or other businesses with which we do business, including unaffiliated insurers whose products we offer or make available to our customers, or other causes. the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as consumers and other stakeholders increase their expectations regarding corporate conduct and responsibility. these impacts may be further complicated by the fact that their perceptions are formed through rapid and broad interactions using modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. any such event could decrease demand for our products, reduce our ability to recruit and retain employees, and lead to greater regulatory scrutiny of our businesses. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talent, including employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives, other key managers, and employees with strong technological, analytical, and other skills and know-how necessary for us to run our vehicle and property insurance businesses and assess potential expansion into new products and business areas. our loss of certain officers and key employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented executives, managers, and employees with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a material adverse effect on our business. - 15 - in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple products and business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy, and we must adapt to increases in business due to additions of or expansions with significant customers, such as transportation network companies. in any such case, we must adjust our hiring and training programs and staffing levels appropriately. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing or under-staffing in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, employee morale, and brand could be materially adversely affected. we use third-party labor to meet a portion of our staffing needs. any significant loss in access to qualified external talent on a cost-effective basis could have an adverse effect on our business. our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace, as well as our failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees. in such events, the productivity of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. we are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. our insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas, such as the use of credit information, methods of customer communications, employment practices, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries' ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries' ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by judicial interpretations of those laws or regulations. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, an insurer's ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent the insurer from obtaining timely rate changes to respond to increased or decreased costs, restrict the ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable businesses, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, dictate or limit the types of investments that an insurance company may hold, and impose specific requirements relating to information technology systems and related cybersecurity risks. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs for us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including potentially material assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. in addition, data privacy and security regulations impose complex compliance and reporting requirements and challenges. for example, california's new consumer privacy protection legislation became effective in 2020. compliance with this new legislation is challenging as it has required us to modify our current business systems and operations in a short time frame and without the benefit of related regulations, which are not required to be issued in final form until six months after the legislation's effective date. other states have enacted or are considering privacy and security legislation or regulations, and variations in requirements across the states present ongoing compliance challenges. compliance with these laws and regulations will result in increased costs, which may be substantial and may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in certain jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in certain cases, revocation of a subsidiary's authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. - 16 - new federal or state legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class/collective/representative actions and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries' business operations. these lawsuits have included cases alleging damages as a result of, among other things, our subsidiaries' methods used for evaluating and paying medical or injury claims or benefits, including, but not limited to, certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist (um/uim), and medical payment claims and for reimbursing medical costs incurred by medicare/medicaid beneficiaries; other claims handling procedures, including, but not limited to, challenges relating to our network of repair facilities, our methods used for estimating physical damage to vehicles for repair purposes and for evaluating the actual cash value of total loss vehicles, our payment of fees and taxes, our subrogation practices, and our handling of diminution of value claims; our assessment of fees related to insufficient funds or reversed payments; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; rating practices; certain policy marketing, sales, services, implementation and renewal practices and procedures, including with respect to accessibility; our snapshot program; certain relationships with independent insurance agents; patent matters, and certain employment practices, including claims relating to pay practices and fair employment practices, among other matters. additional litigation may be filed against us in the future challenging similar or other of our business practices. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries' business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices. in addition, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of judicial regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. adverse court decisions or significant settlements of pending or future cases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. for further information on the risks of pending litigation, see note 12 - litigation in the annual report. our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we develop and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. all of these systems are subject to cyber attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems. such attacks or actions may include attempts to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data, including our intellectual property, financial data, or the personal information of our customers or employees misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers, agents, brokers, or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. some of our systems rely on third-party vendors, through either a connection to, or an integration with, those third-parties' systems. this approach may increase the risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of our information or the confidential information of our customers and employees or other cyber attack, and although we may review and assess third-party vendor cyber security controls, our efforts may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of such events. third-party risks may include, among other factors, the vendor's lax security measures, data location uncertainty, and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security protection. in addition, we seek to protect the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, - 17 - contracts designed to require high security and confidentiality standards, and review of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, our systems are being threatened on a regular basis, we have experienced minor incidents in the past, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing future attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer or employee information is stolen. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. therefore, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions and the operation of various third-party systems. our business is highly dependent upon our ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, many of our critical business systems interface with and depend on third-party systems; an interruption of service from a third-party system for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions. if sustained or repeated, and if an alternate system, process, or vendor is not immediately available to us, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process policies, provide customer service, resolve claims in a timely manner, make payments when required, or perform other necessary business functions. any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business prospects, as well as cause damage to our brand and customer goodwill. efforts to develop new products or enter new areas of business may not be successful and may create enhanced risks. we are developing, and may develop in the future, new insurance products, including those that insure risks that we have not previously insured, contain new coverages, or change coverage terms. these new products may not be as profitable as our existing products and may not perform as well as we expect. in addition, these new products may change our risk exposures, and the business systems, data, and models we use to manage those exposures may be less accurate or less effective than those we use with existing products. in addition, we are evaluating other business models, both insurance and non-insurance related, and are considering investments in different business areas. these activities may take the form of internal development, equity investments, targeted mergers or acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic partnerships. these new ventures may require us to make significant expenditures, which may negatively impact our results in the near term, and if not successful, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. while at the onset of the venture we would expect these projects to provide long-term value, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized. if we were not able to send or accept electronic payments, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. we rely on access to various financial networks to process payments received from our customers. these include credit card and debit card networks and the automated clearing house (ach) network. our ability to participate in these networks depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and with the complex rules of each network and any related industry supervisory groups. if we fail to comply with legal requirements or rules and best practices established by a network or industry group, including those related to data security, we could be assessed significant monetary fines and other penalties, including, in certain cases, the termination of our right to use the applicable network or system. such fines and penalties, and any disruption in or termination of our ability to process customer payments electronically, could materially adversely affect our business and our brand. we may be required to recognize impairments in the value of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in our financial statements. as a result of business acquisitions, we have recorded goodwill (generally representing the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired) and certain intangible assets (at fair value at the time of acquisition) and we may record additional goodwill and intangible assets in the future. we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. valuing these assets, and evaluating their recoverability, requires us to make estimates and assumptions related to future returns on equity, margins, growth rates, discount rates, and other matters, and our estimates may change over time, potentially resulting - 18 - in asset write-downs. goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges could result from declines in operating results, divestitures or sustained market declines, among other factors, and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio consists principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the amount and realization of investment income, or result in realized or unrealized investment losses. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities. concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk - applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities and other bonds with call provisions, prepayment risk is the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, requiring that we reinvest the proceeds at less attractive rates. extension risk is the risk that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of the security and preventing the reinvestment of the principal at higher market rates. liquidity risk - discussed separately below. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio's performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. our common equity portfolio is primarily managed externally to track the russell 1000 index, although we anticipate that during 2020 we will add exchange traded funds or similar securities designed to track the russell 1000 or the standard &amp; poor's 500 ( s&amp;p 500 ) index. our equity investment strategies may not successfully replicate the performance of the indexes that they seek to track. our equity investments are also subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio or exchange traded fund that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000 or s&amp;p 500, is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and they are also subject to most of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. in addition, even though the russell 1000 and s&amp;p 500 indexes are generally considered to be broadly diversified, significant portions of each index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, reducing our ability to manage our concentration risk through sector diversification. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, our financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of our securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary's investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary's ability to write new business. in any such event, our business could be materially adversely affected and our financial flexibility could be substantially constrained. - 19 - see management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2019, and of the market risks associated with our investment portfolio. the elimination of or change in the london interbank offered rate (libor) may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain floating rate securities and other instruments that we hold. libor is a common benchmark interest rate (or reference rate) used to set and make adjustments to interest rates for certain floating rate securities and other financial instruments. published reports have indicated that regulatory authorities and/or financial institutions may change how libor is calculated or discontinue its calculation and publication after 2021. alternative reference rates have been developed, including the federal reserve bank of new york's secured overnight financing rate (sofr), but the acceptance of such alternative rates and their applicability to existing instruments is uncertain. if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from current methods for any reason, outstanding securities with interest rates tied to libor may be adversely affected if those securities either do not provide for the automatic substitution of another reference rate or convert to another reference rate or a fixed rate that could be less favorable to us. outstanding securities and contracts that could be affected include certain preferred stocks and other floating rate securities, fixed rate securities that may convert to libor-based floating rate instruments in the future, certain derivatives, and any other assets or liabilities whose value is tied to libor. any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could also adversely affect the value of those instruments. iv. liquidity risk the inability to access our cash accounts or to convert investments into cash on favorable terms when we desire to do so may materially and adversely affect our business. we rely on our ability to access our cash accounts at banks and other financial institutions to operate our business. if we are unable to access the cash in those accounts as needed, whether due to our own systems difficulties, an institution-specific issue at the bank or financial institution (such as a cybersecurity breach), a broader disruption in banking, financial or wire transfer systems, or otherwise, our ability to pay insurance claims and other financial obligations when due and otherwise operate our business could be materially adversely affected. likewise, our investment portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation's and world's capital markets. any disruption in the functioning of those markets or in our ability to liquidate investments or specific categories of investments on favorable terms when desired, could impair our ability to pay claims or other financial obligations when due. any such event or series of such events could result in significant operational difficulties, reputational harm and adverse actions by regulators and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. v. credit and other financial risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts or transact business (including under certain government programs) become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual or reimbursement obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements and government programs. these include, for example, agreements with other insurance carriers to sell their products to our customers in bundled packages or otherwise, arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance arrangements used by us, our corporate insurance policies, and the performance of state reinsurance facilities/associations), and reimbursement obligations under various state or federal programs, such as the michigan catastrophic claims association or the national flood insurance program. in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks, other financial institutions, or security clearinghouses. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or programs or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, obligation, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses or other problems, which in turn could materially adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay, which in turn may limit our ability to repay indebtedness, make capital contributions to other subsidiaries or affiliates, pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase securities, or meet other obligations. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions, or are able to pay only limited amounts, the progressive corporation may be unable to make payments on its indebtedness, make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates, - 20 - pay dividends to its shareholders, or meet its other obligations. each insurance subsidiary's ability to pay dividends may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, and in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. in addition, under the arx stockholders' agreement, arx cannot pay a dividend without the consent of progressive and another specified arx stockholder. the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from paying a dividend on our common shares in certain circumstances. the terms of our outstanding preferred shares prohibit us from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on our common shares while our preferred shares are outstanding, unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares, including the full dividends for all current dividend periods, have been declared and paid or a sum sufficient for payment thereof set apart, subject to certain exceptions. if we are unable to obtain capital when necessary to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. we may need to acquire additional capital from time to time as a result of many factors. these could include increased regulatory requirements, losses in our insurance or investment operations, or significant growth in the insurance premiums that we write, among others. if we are unable to obtain capital at favorable rates when needed, whether due to our results, volatility or disruptions in debt and equity markets beyond our control, or other reasons, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected. in such an event, unless and until additional sources of capital are secured, we may be limited in our ability, or unable, to service our debt obligations, pay dividends, grow our business, pay our other obligations when due or engage in other corporate transactions. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators, potentially resulting in regulatory actions, and the price of our equity or debt securities could fall significantly. our access to capital markets, ability to obtain or renew financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor's, moody's investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of additional collateral or allow a third party to liquidate the derivative transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. - 21 - our dividend policy may result in varying amounts being paid to our common shareholders, or no payment in some periods, and the dividend policy ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have announced our intention to pay a dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis and to consider paying a variable dividend on at least an annual basis. the amount of dividends, if any, may vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in preceding periods. in addition, the board retains the discretion to alter our policy or not to pay such dividends at any time. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity, financial position or prospects, as described above. any such change could adversely affect investors' perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares. our investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate the anticipated tax benefits and related returns. we may invest in certain projects that we believe are entitled to tax-advantaged treatment under applicable federal or state law, including renewable energy development, historic property rehabilitation, and affordable housing, and we may make other tax-advantaged investments from time to time. our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and, in some cases, through other tax benefits and cash flows from the project. these investments are subject to the risk that the underlying tax credits and related benefits may not be valid, and in some cases previously recorded tax credits can be challenged or are subject to recapture by the applicable taxing authorities if specific requirements are not satisfied. many of the factors that could lead to the invalidity, challenge, or recapture of tax credits are beyond our control. the inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which, at times, may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of any dividend that may be paid. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors' expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our equity or debt securities. our property business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the payment of dividends, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our equity or debt securities. - 22 - quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative

risk disclosures section beginning on page app.-b-46 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect the ability to achieve our business objectives: operating risks are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations. investing risks are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our investment portfolios. unlike most other risks, the actual development of an investment risk factor (such as whether interest rates go down or up) may result in either an increase or decrease in the value of investments we hold. financing risks generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities. similarly, while setting insurance rates, setting loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks, errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. the categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any of the following risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, this could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares could decline materially. i. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies may also enter these markets in the future. many of these companies may have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we have. in addition, competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services which we do not offer. we could be adversely affected by a loss of business to competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our and/or our competitors then-current or historical modes of doing business. as such, our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. in addition, these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). if we are unable successfully to develop, - 11 - table of contents plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive, regulatory and legal environments, our business could be materially adversely affected. similarly, we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition and generate growth. if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors. in the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer former policyholders. our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast the changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and/or employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. we further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that it has developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. our subsidiaries ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. certain states impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies (such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates). insurance laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs, restrict the subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances. in addition, compliance with insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions. - 12 - table of contents the failure to comply with these laws and regulations also could result in actions by regulators or other law enforcement officials, potentially leading to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, progressive and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. during 2005, we received document and information requests from several state attorneys general and insurance regulators regarding ongoing investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers and agents, allegations of bid-rigging by certain brokers and other related matters. for a discussion of our responses to these requests, see the financial condition commitments and contingencies section in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report, which is attached as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. in addition, from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for the progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. lawsuits challenging our business practices, our competitors and other companies are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the use of after-market parts; total loss evaluation methodology; the use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection and medical payment claims; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against progressive and/or its subsidiaries or disputes may arise in the future concerning these or other business practices. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, the subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. moreover, as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. such litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 11, litigation, beginning on page app.-a-21 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders. our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient reliable data, - 13 - table of contents uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally, our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data, our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to project both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy, our ability to project changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable certainty, the development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies, our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations, our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately, unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, changing driving patterns, unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. the realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale, inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. in either event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. our financial performance may also be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses. we continue to be exposed to the risk of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes, as shown by the active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. in addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. most of our past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. when they occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient reliable data, the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends in multiple markets, unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs, unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations, new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts, inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, the accuracy of our estimates of the number or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statement, the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. - 14 - table of contents as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on june 28, 2005. likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, the claims organization culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. our failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity. our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems. our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as internet support and 24-hour call centers, processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims. a shut-down of or inability to access one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity. a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. in addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems. despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. ii. investing risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment risks. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the underlying market rates, which is the most significant risk to the fixed-income portfolio. credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of those issuers or the market value of their securities. prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, adversely affecting the value of or income from such securities and the portfolio. - 15 - table of contents the common equity portfolio, which is managed to track the russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio. in addition, both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local, national or international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks, recessions or depressions, a significant change in inflation expectations, a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance company investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements. if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. iii. financing risks our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: state insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company. further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, on page 19 of this report. our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships, including without limitation, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support, and other services that are integral to our operations) and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). if one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations. - 16 - table of contents our access to capital markets, our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard poor and moody investors service. in addition, the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries is rated by a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in either event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. - 17 - table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from the investments section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section beginning on page app.-a-46 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives: operating risks are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations. investing risks are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our investment portfolios. unlike most other risks, the actual development of an investment risk factor (such as whether 11 table of contents interest rates go down or up) may result in either an increase or decrease in the value of investments we hold. financing risks generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital. in addition, a fourth category of other risks is included below to highlight additional matters that our shareholders should consider to better understand management long-term approach to the business. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities. similarly, while setting insurance rates, setting loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks, errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. the categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time. the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, this could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares could decline materially. i. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies may have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we have. in addition, competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our and/or our competitors then-current or historical modes of doing business. as such, our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. in addition, these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). if we are unable successfully to develop, plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive, regulatory and legal environments, or if we are unable to identify effective strategies in the first instance to maintain or enhance our competitive position, our business could be materially adversely affected. similarly, we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers. if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the recent increases in advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market. the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors. in the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our company 12 table of contents and other insurance companies may be required under state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer former policyholders. our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and/or employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. we further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia,

impose restrictions on or require prior regulatory approval of various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies (such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn). insurance laws and regulations may limit the insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent the subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict the subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances. in addition, compliance with insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the failure to comply with these laws and regulations also could result in actions by regulators or other law enforcement officials, potentially leading to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries can face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. during 2004 and 2005, we received document and information requests from several state attorneys general and insurance regulators regarding investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers and agents, allegations of bid-rigging by certain brokers and other related matters. we have not been notified by any governmental or regulatory authority that we are the target of any such investigation. for a discussion of these 13 table of contents requests, see the financial condition commitments and contingencies section in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the annual report, which is attached as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. in addition, from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies are pending, and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations, and such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries use of after-market parts; total loss evaluation methodology; use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection and medical payment claims; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning how we settle claims, our employment-related practices, medical malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from the operation of our business. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, the subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. moreover, as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. such litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 11, litigation, beginning on page app.-a.-23 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders. our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient reliable data, uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally, our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data, our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to project both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy, our ability to project changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable certainty, the development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies, 14 table of contents our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations, our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately, unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, changing driving patterns, unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. the realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale, inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. in either event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business. our long-term growth prospects could be impacted by reduced accident frequency trends. auto accident frequency has steadily declined since 2000, contributing to lower insurance premiums for many consumers. although not conclusive, several contributors to reduced frequency include improved vehicle safety, road design and driver education. we are not able to predict whether frequency will continue to decline, will stabilize or will return to increasing trends more consistent with the periods prior to 2000. if the recent trend continues, however, declining auto accident frequency, if not offset by an increase in severity, could lead to a long-term reduction in the amount of premiums written in the auto insurance industry, thus directly affecting our ability to grow our auto insurance business revenues. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient reliable data, the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends in multiple markets, unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs, unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations, new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts, inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, the accuracy of our estimates of the frequency or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements, the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on june 28, 2006. likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, the claims organization culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement 15 table of contents appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. our failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity. our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. in addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. most of our past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms, as evidenced recently by the active hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. when they occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems. our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions, such as internet support and 24-hour call centers, processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims. a shut-down of or inability to access one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems for any reason, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded, could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity. a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. in addition, we could be subject to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated from our computer systems. despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. ii. investing risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment risks. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the underlying market rates, which is the most significant risk to the fixed-income portfolio. credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of those issuers or the market value of their securities. 16 table of contents prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, adversely affecting the value of or income from such securities and the portfolio. the common equity portfolio, which is managed to track the russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio. in addition, both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local, national or international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks, recessions or depressions, a significant change in inflation expectations, a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance company investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements. if we at that time are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. iii. financing risks our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: state insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. state regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus availability of the insurance company. competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company. further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, on page 20 of this report. our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships, including without limitation, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support, and other services that are integral to our operations) and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). if one or more of these parties were 17 table of contents to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations. our decision to retain a specific amount of capital that is not adequate to support our actual business needs could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to grow. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to provide for the anticipated growth of our insurance businesses, and to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses. the level of capital that is retained at any time is determined by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results, our growth prospects, and estimates of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face. if our actual capital level turns out to be lower than is actually needed at a given time, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected, our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found, and our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted. our access to capital markets, our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard poor and moody investors service. in addition, the financial strength of our insurance subsidiaries is rated by a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in either event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. iv. other risks we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend paid under our annual variable dividend policy. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors expectations, which could result in significant volatility in our stock price. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from the investments section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section beginning on page app.-a-50 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives: operating risks are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations. investing risks are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our investment portfolios. unlike most other risks, the actual development of an investment risk factor (such as interest rates going down or up) may result in either an increase or decrease in the value of investments we hold. financing risks generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities. similarly, while setting insurance rates, establishing loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks, errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. the categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time. additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, this could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares could decline materially. i. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies may have greater financial, marketing and management resources than we have. in addition, competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. in recent years, the highly competitive nature of the automobile insurance industry has been evidenced, in part, by declining premium rates for many consumers, including our own recent rate reductions. among other factors, these price decreases have been driven primarily by decreasing frequency trends (i.e., less accidents per insurance policy), which have not been fully offset by increases in severity (i.e., amounts paid per accident). this very competitive environment has in turn resulted in lower operating income and revenue growth rates for us. we cannot predict whether these trends will continue, but if they do, our growth rates at a 96 combined ratio may become pressured. 12 table of contents from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors , then-current or historical modes of doing business. as such, our innovations may entail a degree of risk and may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. in addition, these initiatives may be subject to challenge by regulators or private litigants and may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). if we are unable successfully to develop, plan and implement our strategic initiatives in these competitive, regulatory and legal environments, or if we are unable to identify effective strategies in the first instance to maintain or enhance our competitive position, our business could be materially adversely affected. similarly, we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns, and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers. if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the recent increases in advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market. the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors. in the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer former policyholders. our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected. we further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. our insurance subsidiaries ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. certain states impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies (such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the 13 table of contents use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn). insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets or prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances. in addition, compliance with insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased administrative costs to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the alleged failure to so comply, by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials. for example, in recent years, several states have included us in document and information requests relating to investigations into the relationships between insurers and brokers and agents, allegations of bid rigging by certain brokers and related matters, although we have not been notified that we are the target of any such investigation. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. in addition, from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations, and such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries use of after-market parts; total loss evaluation methodology; use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, medical malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. moreover, as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability or financial condition. for further information 14 table of contents on pending litigation, see note 11 litigation , beginning on page app.-a-24 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders. our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. as a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient reliable data, uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally, our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data, our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy, our ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable certainty, the development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies, our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations, our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately, unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, changing driving patterns, unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. the realization of such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale, inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. in either event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business. our growth trends have been and could continue to be impacted by reduced accident frequency trends. auto accident frequency has steadily declined since 2000. although not conclusive, several contributors to reduced frequency include improved vehicle safety, road design and driver education as well as the increased price of gasoline which, along with other factors, may affect consumers driving habits. these frequency trends have led us, and most competitors, to lower our insurance premiums, which in turn has adversely impacted our recent premium growth rates. we are not able to predict whether frequency will continue to decline, stabilize or return to increasing trends more consistent with the periods prior to 2000. if the recent trend continues, however, declining auto accident frequency, if not offset by an increase in severity, could continue to pressure premium growth rates and potentially lead to a long-term reduction in the amount of premiums written in the auto insurance industry, thus directly affecting our ability to grow our auto insurance business revenues. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries will ultimately pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient reliable data, the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends in multiple markets, 15 table of contents unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs, unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations, new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts, inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, the accuracy of our estimates of the frequency or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements, the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on june 28, 2007. likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience and skill of our claims representatives, the claims organization culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. our failure to pay claims accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity. our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. in addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our

a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects and liquidity. 16 table of contents a security breach of our computer systems could also interrupt or damage our operations, subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated, and significantly damage our reputation. despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business. we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the pci security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments. at year end 2007, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. ii. investing risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to investment risks. our fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the market interest rates, which is the most significant risk to the fixed-income portfolio. credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of one or more issuers of those instruments and, ultimately, the risk of permanent loss in the event of default by an issuer. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition, performance or outlook of those issuers, sectors or industries. prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, adversely affecting the value of or income from such securities and the portfolio. the common equity portfolio, which is managed to track the russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. equity markets and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio. in addition, both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate investments on favorable terms on short notice may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by local, national or international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks, recessions or depressions, a significant change in inflation expectations, a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. 17 table of contents if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance company investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements. if we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , beginning on page app.-a-30 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion on current market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iii. financing risks our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: state insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. state regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus availability of the insurance company. competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company. further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, beginning on page 21 of this report. the progressive corporation annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, and the dividend program may ultimately be changed. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor (set by the board of directors for each of 2007 and 2008 at 20%) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). to the extent our comprehensive income, which includes net investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses, is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be payable. for 2007, this calculation resulted in a dividend payment of $.145 per share, which was paid on january 31, 2008. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2008 (to be paid early in 2009), the dividend will not be declared by the board until december 2008, and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2008 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under investing risks. any such change could adversely affect investors perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our stock. 18 table of contents our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent or experiences other financial hardship. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships. these include, for example, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support, and other services that are integral to our operations), joint marketing arrangements and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). if one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations and damage to our reputation. if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, and to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses. the level of capital that is retained at any time is determined by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and estimates of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management. the amount of capital that we maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face. while our techniques for our capital needs are continually enhanced, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected, our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found, and our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted. our access to capital markets, our financing arrangements and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard poor (aa ), moody investors service (aa2) and a.m. best (a , with one company rated a). progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in either event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend paid under our annual variable dividend policy. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors expectations, which could result in significant volatility in our stock price. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price. 19 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from the results of operations investments section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section, beginning on page app.-a-60 of the annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into three broad categories in assessing how they may affect our ability to achieve our business objectives: operating risks are those stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations. investing risks are uncertainties relating to the performance and preservation of our investment portfolios. financing risks generally relate to our ability to obtain capital, when necessary, to pay or otherwise perform our obligations, including obligations under any debt instruments issued, and to earn the cost of equity capital. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, state regulation of insurance companies may also affect our investing and financing activities. similarly, while setting insurance rates, establishing loss reserves and adjusting claims are properly discussed as operating risks, errors in these disciplines may have an impact on the investing and financing areas as well. the categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters being discussed. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time. it should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, sales of new vehicles, inflation or deflation, stock market valuations, interest rates, consumer confidence and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares could decline materially. i. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national companies and smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management and sophisticated marketing, underwriting and pricing strategies. our business focuses on insurance for personal automobiles and recreation vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses. competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, and cost control are major competitive factors. historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. unexpected increases in the insurers underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs and the expenses to resolve claims) can further decrease profits or result in underwriting losses. as the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors , then-current or historical modes of doing business, and these changes must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. as such, our innovations may entail a degree of complexity and risk that 11 makes their implementation a challenge, and our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. in addition, these initiatives may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, our business could be materially adversely affected. at the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. this can include product, pricing or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technology advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success. we undertake distinctive advertising campaigns, and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business and increase the retention of our current customers. if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts within the automobile insurance market. the highly competitive nature of the markets in which we compete could also result in the failure of one or more major competitors. in the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under state-mandated plans to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer former policyholders. our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, managers and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with a variety of backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected. we further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing models and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations at the state or federal level or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states and the district of columbia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. our insurance subsidiaries ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. certain states impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting and efforts to freeze, set or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances or prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders. in addition, laws in certain states mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances, including to pay claims upon the insolvency of 12 other insurance companies or to cover losses in state-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions. in addition, the innovative strategies that we pursue in our efforts to compete may deviate from standard practices in the industry. these innovations often involve significant complexity and, as a result, can be a challenge to implement, requiring us to effectively deploy our management and other resources. this may create the potential for errors or inaccuracies in our implementation of the strategy. if we are alleged to have damaged or otherwise disadvantaged consumers, competitors or other industry participants as a result, we could be subject to regulatory or other official investigations and sanctions, as well as litigation from third parties. the failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations, or the alleged failure to so comply, by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by its insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more states. in addition, from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. state insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations. other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries total loss evaluation methodology; use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of medical and attorney malpractice and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. moreover, as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 litigation in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders. our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, underwriting expenses and to earn a profit. 13 pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. as a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient reliable data, uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally, our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data, our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy, our ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable accuracy, the development, selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies, our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations, our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately, unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, changing driving patterns, unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used car prices. the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. in either event, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves and to adjust claims accurately. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient reliable data, the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends in multiple markets, unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs, unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations, new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts, inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability, ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices, the accuracy of our estimates of the frequency or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements, the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on june 30, 2008. likewise, we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent claims, the claims organization culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies and systems to support our claims functions and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. our failure to pay claims fairly and accurately could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our financial results, prospects and liquidity. 14 our financial performance may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic losses. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages or interruptions of communications facilities. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. in addition, our business could be further impaired if a significant portion of our business or systems were shut down by, or if we were unable to gain access to certain of our facilities as a result of, such an event. most of our past catastrophe-related claims have resulted from severe storms. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. when they occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems. our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. a shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems for any reason, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded, could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill. our business is highly dependent on access to, and the performance of, the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments. a security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations; infect, corrupt or destroy data or systems; subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated; and significantly damage our reputation. despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems. any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the pci security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments. in september 2008, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. ii. investing risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in the market interest rates. credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may become impaired due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those instruments or, in the case of asset-backed 15 securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition, performance or outlook of those issuers, sectors or industries. prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of or income from such securities and the portfolio. liquidity risk the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on short notice, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio performance also may be adversely impacted if there is a lack of transparency regarding the businesses of issuers of securities that we purchase, if credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete information or prove unwarranted, or if our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions, among other factors. the common equity portfolio, which is managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment that is designed to track an index such as the russell 1000 does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to periods of high volatility and may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, discussed above. for example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of interest-sensitive companies. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio when such a sector underperforms. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline in the value of our common equity portfolio. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national or international events, such as power outages, system failures, wars or terrorist attacks; a recession, depression or other adverse developments in either the u.s. or other economies that adversely affects the value of corporate, municipal and asset-backed securities held in our portfolio; financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default; inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired; the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the government fails or refuses to engage in such efforts; a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation; and a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to be impaired by market, sector or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance company investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements. if we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. 16 see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2008 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iii. financing risks our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: state insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus. state regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company. competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from state regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the holding company. further information on state insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, herein. the progressive corporation annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (20% for each of 2008 and 2009) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). to the extent our after-tax comprehensive income, which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses, is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be payable. for 2008, this calculation resulted in no dividend being paid to shareholders. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2009 (to be paid early in 2010), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until december 2009, and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2009 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital markets or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under investing risks. any such change could adversely affect investors perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our stock. our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts becomes insolvent, experiences other financial hardship or defaults in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual relationships. these include, for example, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology equipment and support, and other services that are integral to our operations), private labeling arrangements and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, with major banks or other financial institutions. if one or more of these parties were to default on the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses, operational problems and brand risk, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows or results of operations and cause damage to our reputation. 17 if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, and to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses. the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management. the amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types of risks that we are likely to face. while our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investing results (including investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares, the establishment of credit lines and the issuance by us of debt, equity or other securities. if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected and our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, and institutional and other investors), and as a result, our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common shares could fall significantly. in addition, the recoverability of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that in part depend on substantial recovery to original cost for our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels. our access to capital markets, our ability to enter into new financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and our business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor s, moody investors service and a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected). perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post collateral in amounts then owed to the other party in cash or high grade assets. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors expectations, which could result in significant volatility in our stock price. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in our stock price. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. 22risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses of, or liabilities incurred by, policyholders operating risks the risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly affect our insurance operations market risks changes in the value of invested assets from a variety of factors, including interest rate movements, market price fluctuations, credit spread widening, risk premium pricing, liquidity difficulties, foreign exchange rate changes, and the performance of an individual issuer or a market sector, and credit risks the risks that a counter-party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a contract, as well as our ability to obtain capital when necessary, pay or otherwise satisfy our obligations when due, and earn the cost of equity capital. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below. the categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the sec, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time. it should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, sales of new vehicles, inflation or deflation, stock market valuations, interest rates, consumer confidence and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders. our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premium to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. as a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient reliable data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action the occurrence and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, other severe weather, and terrorist events understanding the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices changing driving patterns 11 unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices. the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our volume and competitiveness. in either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions by courts inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and changing theories of liability the effects of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on june 25, 2009. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. when they occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. in addition, changing climate conditions may increase the frequency of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, other storms and fires, and we will continue to monitor and assess scientific information relating to such developments. we use catastrophe modeling tools to help manage our exposures to such events, but those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that may provide projections that are materially different from the actual events. as a result, increased levels of hurricanes and other storms could have a material and adverse effect on our insurance operating results. ii. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and sophisticated marketing, underwriting, and pricing strategies. our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses. competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or 12 offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. unexpected increases in the insurers underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can further reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. as the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for progressive business prospects at that time. on the other hand, in the event of a failure of a major insurer, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term. our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors , then-current or historical modes of doing business, and these changes must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. as such, our innovations may entail a degree of complexity and risk that makes their implementation a challenge and our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. in addition, these initiatives may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, our business could be materially adversely affected. at the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. this can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technology advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success. the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses, combined with ongoing technological, regulatory, and other developments, results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. the complexity, in turn, leads to the increased possibility of error in executing business strategies, as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources (such as it resources) for multiple potential initiatives or projects. our inability to manage this complexity effectively, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors could result in substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, regulatory investigations and sanctions, poor customer experiences, and damage to our brand. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly significant given the importance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts, and related expenditures, within the automobile insurance market. if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. these situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, errors in handling a customer policy, inappropriate handling of claims of policyholders or other parties, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to systems failures, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by unrelated businesses that we have introduced to our customers to provide insurance products that we do not offer, and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors. 13 our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, and brand could be materially adversely affected. we further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia and, beginning in december 2009, australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. our insurance subsidiaries ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances, including to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with insurance-related laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations, or an alleged failure to so comply, by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. we are unable to predict whether any such laws will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. 14 our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization culture, and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the success of our concierge-level claims services program. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations. other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. federal fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of medical or attorney malpractice, and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs, and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. moreover, as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields, a new layer of court-imposed regulation could emerge, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 litigation in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions, including our information technology and other business systems. our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, or interruptions of data processing and storage systems and communications facilities. likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill. our business is highly dependent on access to, and the performance of, the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments. 15 a security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations; infect, corrupt, or destroy data or systems; subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated; and significantly damage our reputation. despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, insider threats, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments. satisfaction of the pci standards does not ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis, but it is required to do business with the credit card companies. in september 2009, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease in value due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition, performance, or outlook of those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of, or income from, such securities and the portfolio by investing at less attractive rates. liquidity risk the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete information or prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. the common equity portfolio, which is managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, discussed above. for example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of interest-sensitive companies. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio when such a sector underperforms. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital. 16 both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks a recession, depression, or other adverse developments in either the u.s. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation, and a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions to a substantial degree, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance company investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary ability to write new business. if we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2009 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iv. credit risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial hardship, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service relationships. these include, for example, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations), private labeling arrangements, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks or other financial institutions. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness, or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus 17 insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company further information on insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock, and fund corporate opportunities. the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level prescribed by management. the amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. while our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investment results (including investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares, the establishment of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities. if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected and our ability to grow the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are found. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and our customers), and as a result, our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. in addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost for our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels. our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor s, moody investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. the progressive corporation annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (20% for 2009 and 25% for 2010) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). to the extent our after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be payable. in 2008, this calculation resulted in no dividend being paid to shareholders, while for 2009 we paid a dividend of $.1613 per share in february 2010. 18 because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2010 (to be paid early in 2011), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2010 or early 2011, and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2010 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under investing risks. any such change could adversely affect investors perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. 23risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses of, or liabilities incurred by, policyholders operating risks the risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks changes in the value of invested assets which might result from a variety of factors, including interest rate movements, market price fluctuations, credit spread widening, risk premium pricing, liquidity difficulties, foreign exchange rate changes, and the performance of an individual issuer or a market sector, and credit risks the risks that a counter-party to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms and conditions of a contract, as well as our ability to obtain capital when necessary, pay or otherwise satisfy our obligations when due. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, it should be noted that many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below. the categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ), as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time. it should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, inflation or deflation, market valuations, interest rates, consumer confidence and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders. our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. the role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. as a result, our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient reliable data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those innovations our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, other severe weather, and terrorist events understanding the impact of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices changing driving patterns 11 unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices. the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, constraining our ability to write new business. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 8 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on june 30, 2010. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. if they occur with enough severity, our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. in addition, changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, other storms and fires. we use catastrophe modeling tools to help estimate our exposures to such events, but those tools are based on historical data and other assumptions that may provide projections that are materially different from the actual events. as a result, increased levels of hurricanes and other storms could have a material adverse effect on our insurance operating results. ii. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses. competitors may offer consumers combinations of auto policies and other insurance products or financial services that we do not offer. we could be adversely affected by the failure to generate new business, or to retain a sufficient percentage of our current customers, as a result of competitors offering similar insurance products at lower prices or 12 offering bundled products or services and by other competitor initiatives. the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, which has been defined by periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. unexpected increases in the insurers underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can further reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. as the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for progressive business prospects at that time. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophic fund, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term. our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors , then-current or historical modes of doing business, and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. these innovations may also require extensive modifications to our systems and processes, and thus may add to our costs and entail a degree of complexity and risk that makes their implementation a challenge. in addition, our efforts may not ultimately achieve anticipated business goals. these initiatives may also disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition, our business could be materially adversely affected. at the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. this can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technology advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. our ability to react to such advances and then navigate the new competitive environment is also important to our success. the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses, combined with ongoing technological, regulatory, and other developments, results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. the complexity may create a barrier to implementing certain new ideas, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies, as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources (such as it resources) for multiple potential initiatives or projects. our inability to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors could result in substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, regulatory investigations and sanctions, poor customer experiences, and damage to our brand. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts, and related expenditures, within the automobile insurance market. if these campaigns or efforts are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. these situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, systems failures, effects of cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), errors in handling a customer policy, inappropriate handling of 13 claims of policyholders or other parties, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to systems failures, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by our other business partners, including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance) and other business partners, and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, and brand could be materially adversely affected. we further believe that our success depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. our insurance subsidiaries ability to comply with these laws and regulations at reasonable costs, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. insurance laws and regulations may limit our insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments arising in a number of circumstances, including to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations, or an alleged failure to so comply, by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. for example, in 2010, congress passed the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ), which, in addition to imposing a number of new compliance obligations on publicly traded companies, created within the united states department of the treasury a new federal insurance office (fio), whose purpose is (in part) to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk. if the fio were to recommend to the new financial stability 14 oversight council (also created by the dodd-frank act) that we are systemically significant and therefore require additional regulation, or that the insurance industry as a whole should be regulated at the federal level, our businesses could be affected significantly. we are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization culture and the effectiveness of its management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the success of our concierge level claims services program. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations. other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. federal fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that our subsidiaries business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of medical or attorney malpractice, and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs, and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of court-imposed regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 litigation in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions. our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, or interruptions of data processing and storage systems and communications facilities. likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill. 15 our business is highly dependent on access to, and the operation of, the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments. a security breach of our computer systems or other operations could also interrupt or damage our operations; infect, corrupt, or destroy data or systems; subject us to liability if confidential customer information is misappropriated; and significantly damage our reputation. despite the implementation of security measures, including hiring an independent firm to perform intrusion vulnerability testing of our computer systems, these systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, programming errors, insider threats, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. any compromise of security could deter people from entering into transactions that involve transmitting confidential information to our systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. we rely heavily on credit card acceptance for premium payment and settlement of claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures to help ensure the safe handling of sensitive information by companies accepting credit card payments. satisfaction of the pci standards does not ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis, but it is required to do business with the credit card companies. in september 2010, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes certified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease in value due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of, or income from, such securities and the portfolio by investing at less attractive rates. liquidity risk the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. the common equity portfolio, which is managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index, is subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, discussed above. for example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of 16 interest-sensitive companies. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks a recession, depression, or other adverse developments in either the u.s. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts investor fear, whether substantive or not, causing the market to react irrationally a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation, and a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance company investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary ability to write new business. if we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2010 and on the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iv. credit risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial hardship, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. these include, for example, contracts for the acquisitions of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations), agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks or other financial institutions. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repay indebtedness, or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, 17 progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company further information on insurance laws and regulations which may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock, and fund corporate opportunities. the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process. the amount of capital that we seek to maintain is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. while our techniques for estimating our capital needs are continually enhanced, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by the performance of our insurance operations and investment results (including investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares and debt securities, the establishment of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities. if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. if our capital level turns out to be lower than the amount needed at a given time, our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are secured. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and our customers), and as a result, our ability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. in addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels. our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength is evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor s, moody investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. the progressive corporation annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (25% for 2010 and 33-1/3% for 18 2011) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). to the extent our after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2011 (to be paid early in 2012), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2011 or early 2012, and the board could decide to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2011 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, or disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under investing risks. any such change could adversely affect investors perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term position, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term performance, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k.risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses of, or liabilities incurred by, policyholders operating risks the risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios, which might result from a variety of factors impacting the investment marketplace generally, or the sectors, industries, or individual securities in which we have invested, and credit risks the risks that a counterparty to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract or that we will be unable to obtain capital when necessary or to pay or otherwise satisfy our obligations when due. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially. this information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ), as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by us from time to time. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, other severe weather, and terrorist events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claims settlement practices changing driving patterns advancements in vehicle technology 12 unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices. the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 9 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on june 30, 2011. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions may increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools and third-party experts to help estimate our exposures to such events, but those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions and may result in projections that prove to be inaccurate. an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations. ii. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and pricing capabilities. the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. 13 our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses, all of which are highly competitive businesses. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised. in addition, due to our focus on the auto insurance market, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time. for example, if changing driving patterns, rising gasoline prices, advancements in vehicle technology, or other factors, were to result in decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period, our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired. historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. unexpected increases in the insurers underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. as the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies, as a result of varying loss cost experiences and profitability goals), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for progressive business prospects at that time. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophic fund, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term. our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors , then-current or historical modes of doing business, and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. these innovations may also require extensive modifications to our systems and processes, and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk, which makes their implementation a challenge. in addition, our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with, or in reliance on, third party vendors and their systems, which may further limit our control of implementation, quality, customer experiences, and successful outcomes. our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set. our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition, our business could be materially adversely affected. at the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. these developments can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technological advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. the growth in mobile communications and the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers are recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace where we are committing substantial resources. our ability to react to such advances, develop and maintain winning strategies, and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success. the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses, combined with ongoing technological, regulatory, and other developments, results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. the complexity may create barriers to implementing certain new ideas or providing high-quality products and customer experiences, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies, as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources (such as it resources) for competing initiatives or projects. our inability to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors could result in decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business, poor customer experiences, substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, regulatory investigations and sanctions, and damage to our brand. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business, and increase the retention of our 14 current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market. if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. these situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, systems failures, effects of cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), errors in handling a customer policy, inappropriate handling of claims of policyholders or other parties, misconduct by our officers, directors or employees or others acting on our behalf, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of third-party systems that we use, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by our other business partners, including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance) and other business partners, and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, and brand could be materially adversely affected. our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers. our insurance subsidiaries ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, such as, in recent years, legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. insurance laws and regulations may, among other things, limit our insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in 15 addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. for example, in 2010, congress passed the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act ( dodd-frank act ), which, among other provisions that could impact aspects of our operations, created within the united states department of the treasury a new federal insurance office (fio), whose purpose is (in part) to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk. if the fio were to recommend to the new financial stability oversight council (also created by the dodd-frank act) that we are systemically significant and therefore require additional regulation, or that the insurance industry as a whole should be regulated at the federal level, our businesses could be affected significantly. we are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization culture and the effectiveness of its management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the success of our concierge level claims services program. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations. other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of medical or attorney malpractice, and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs, and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of court-imposed regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 litigation in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. these systems are subject to attacks by third parties, including sophisticated individuals and groups with substantial computing resources and capabilities. such attacks may include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data misappropriate funds 16 disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. similarly, an employee, consultant, agent, or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions, or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack, which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and in the loss, corruption, or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees. we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party vendors, which may provide software, data storage, and other computer services to us (some of which may be referred to as cloud computing ). these third-party systems may experience similar cyber attacks and other security breaches, along with the possible risk of loss or unauthorized publication of progressive information or the confidential information of our customers and employees. these relationships present further risk management challenges for us, including, among others: confirming and monitoring the third-party security measures; the potential for improper handling of or access to our data; and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and the sensitive personal information of our customers and employees. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security assurance. examples include physical security measures, access and password policies, firewalls, systems monitoring, malicious code protection, network and host-based intrusion detection and prevention measures, data loss prevention measures, configuration assurance, data encryption, and event management, as well as third party intrusion vulnerability testing. in addition, we seek to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards, and ongoing testing, auditing, and evaluation of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party systems are adversely affected. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments, such as progressive, must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information. while the pci standards set a high bar for data security, compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis. in september 2011, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes, recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions. our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks (as discussed above), riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities. likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such events could result in a 17 deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill. our business is also highly dependent on access to, and the operation of, the financial markets to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss. in the case of governmental issuers, the risk includes the potential for unbalanced budgets, required austerity measures, debt defaults, or other social or political turmoil. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of, or income from, such securities and the portfolio by investing at less attractive rates. liquidity risk the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized credit rating agencies are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by a separate investment advisory firm using a value-oriented investment approach. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. for example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of interest-sensitive companies. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital. likewise, the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisor, including sector or industry concentrations, lack of geographic diversification, and the performance of individual issuers. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: 18 local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks a recession, depression, political or social upheaval, or other development in either the u.s. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize their budgets or economies through austerity programs, tax increases or other measures, to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts investor fear, whether substantiated or not, causing the market to react irrationally a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation a default on sovereign debt, or the perception that such a default is likely, and a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary ability to write new business. if we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2011, and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iv. credit risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. these include, for example, contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations), agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks or other financial institutions. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase its securities, repay indebtedness, or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliate. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares or other securities, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliate. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, or 19 in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to meet regulatory requirements, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock or other securities, and fund corporate opportunities. the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process. the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by regulatory requirements and the performance of our insurance operations and investment results (including investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares and debt securities, the establishment of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities. if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time, our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are secured. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and our customers), potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. in addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels. our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor s, moody investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. the progressive corporation annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (33-1/3% for 2011 and 2012) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to 20 repeat the annual dividend in 2012 (to be paid early in 2013), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2012 or early 2013, and the board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2012 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under investing risks. any such change could adversely affect investors perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are incorporated by reference from section iv. results of operations investments in our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, as described in item 7 above. additional information is incorporated by reference from the quantitative market risk disclosures section in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. 25risk factors progressive business involves various risks and uncertainties, certain of which are discussed in this section. management divides these risks into four broad categories in assessing how they may affect our financial condition and operating results, as well as our ability to achieve our business objectives: insurance risks risks associated with assuming, or indemnifying for, the losses of, or liabilities incurred by, policyholders operating risks the risks stemming from external or internal events or circumstances that directly or indirectly may affect our insurance operations market risks changes in the value of assets held in our investment portfolios, which might result from a variety of factors impacting the investment marketplace generally, or the sectors, industries, or individual securities in which we have invested, and credit risks the risks that a counterparty to a transaction will fail to perform according to the terms of a contract or that we will be unable to obtain capital when necessary or to pay or otherwise satisfy our obligations when due. although we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, many of the risks may have ramifications in more than one category. for example, although presented as an operating risk below, governmental regulation of insurance companies also affects our investing and financing activities, which are addressed separately under market risks and credit risks below. these categories, therefore, should be viewed as a starting point for understanding the significant risks facing us and not as a limitation on the potential impact of the matters discussed. it also should be noted that our business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond our control. issues such as unemployment rates, the number of vehicles sold, inflation or deflation, consumer confidence, and construction spending, among a host of other factors, will have a bearing on the amount of insurance that is purchased by consumers and small businesses. in addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. if any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, develop into actual events, we could experience a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. in that case, the market price of our common shares or debt securities could decline materially. this information is not all encompassing and should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in the other reports and materials filed by us with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ), as well as news releases and other information we publicly disseminate from time to time. i. insurance risks our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders . our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for a full spectrum of risks. a primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses, and to earn a profit. pricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical accident and loss data, and the projection of future accident trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation: the availability of sufficient, reliable data our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions, generally our ability to timely recognize changes in trend and to predict both the severity and frequency of future losses with reasonable accuracy our ability to predict changes in operating expenses with reasonable accuracy the development, selection, and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies, and the success of those strategies our ability to implement rate changes and obtain any required regulatory approvals on a timely basis our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately unanticipated court decisions, legislation, or regulatory action the frequency and severity of catastrophic events, such as hurricanes, hail storms, other severe weather, and terrorist events our ability to understand the impact of ongoing changes in our claims settlement practices changing driving patterns 13 advancements in vehicle technology and safety features, such as accident prevention technologies or the development of autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy, including medical costs and systemic changes resulting from national or state health care laws or regulations, and unanticipated changes in auto repair costs, auto parts prices, and used car prices. the realization of one or more of such risks may result in our pricing being based on inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses, assumptions, or methodologies, and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims. as a result, we could underprice risks, which would negatively affect our underwriting profit margins, or we could overprice risks, which could reduce our competitiveness and growth prospects. in either event, our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. in addition, underpricing insurance policies over time could erode the capital position of one or more of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby constraining our ability to write new business. our success depends on our ability to establish accurate loss reserves. our financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that the subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. there is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property and casualty insurance loss reserves, which can arise from a number of factors, including: the availability of sufficient, reliable data the difficulty in predicting the rate and direction of changes in frequency and severity trends, including the effects of future inflation rates, in multiple markets unexpected changes in medical and auto repair costs unanticipated changes in governing statutes and regulations new or changing interpretations of insurance policy provisions and coverage-related issues by courts the effects of changes in our claims settlement practices our ability to recognize fraudulent or inflated claims the accuracy of our estimates regarding claims that have been incurred but not recorded as of the date of the financial statements the accuracy and adequacy of actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating loss reserves, and the accuracy and timeliness of estimates of total loss and loss adjustment expenses as determined by our employees for different categories of claims. as a result of these and other risks and uncertainties, the ultimate paid losses and loss adjustment expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, or financial position. further information on our loss reserves can be found in the liability for property-casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses discussion beginning on page 9 of this report, as well as our report on loss reserving practices, which was filed with the sec on form 8-k on august 7, 2012. our insurance operating results may be materially adversely affected by severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events. catastrophes can be caused by natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. the incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable. moreover, changing climate conditions, whether due to an increase in average temperatures (global climate change) or other causes, may increase how often severe weather events and other natural disasters occur and how much insured damage they cause. the extent of insured losses from a catastrophe is a function of both our total net insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the nature and severity of the event. we use catastrophe modeling tools and third-party experts to help estimate our exposures to such events, but those tools and expert opinions are based on historical data and other assumptions that limit their reliability, and they may become even less reliable as climatic conditions change. as a result, our forecasting efforts may generate projections that prove to be materially inaccurate. an increase in the frequency or severity of catastrophes during a given period could materially adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, and results of operations. ii. operating risks we compete in the automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets, which are highly competitive. we face vigorous competition from large, well-capitalized national and international companies, as well as smaller regional insurers. other large national and international insurance or financial services companies also may enter these markets in the future. many of these companies have substantial resources, experienced management, and strong marketing, underwriting, and 14 pricing capabilities. the automobile insurance industry is a relatively mature industry, in which brand recognition, marketing skills, operational effectiveness (including, for example, rate and claim-paying accuracy, customer experience, and application of information technology), pricing, scale, and cost control are major competitive factors. our business focuses on insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles and on commercial auto policies for small businesses, all of which are highly competitive markets. if our competitors offer similar insurance products at lower prices, offer such insurance products bundled with other products or services that we do not offer, or engage in other successful competitive initiatives, our ability to generate new business or to retain a sufficient number of our existing customers could be seriously compromised. in addition, due to our focus on the auto insurance market, we may be more sensitive than other insurers to trends that could affect auto insurance coverages and rates over time. for example, if governmental restrictions, economic conditions, demographic trends, changing driving patterns, rising gasoline prices, advancements in vehicle technology or safety features, or other factors, were to result in decreased auto insurance rates for an extended period, the automobile insurance market as a whole could shrink and our ability to generate revenue growth could be significantly impaired. historically, the auto insurance industry has been known as a cyclical industry, with periods of relatively strong profitability being followed by increased pricing competition among insurers. this price competition, which is sometimes referred to as a soft market, can adversely affect revenue and profitability levels. unexpected increases in the insurers underlying costs (such as vehicle repair costs, medical costs, and the expenses to resolve claims) can reduce profits or result in underwriting losses. as the insurers recognize this situation (which can occur at different times for different companies, as a result of varying loss cost experiences and profitability goals), the historical reaction has been for insurers to raise their rates (sometimes referred to as a hard market ) in an attempt to restore profit to acceptable levels. as more insurers react in this way, profit levels in the industry may increase to a point where some insurers begin to lower their rates, starting the cycle over again. in the past, this cycle has generally played out over a number of years. we cannot determine whether such cyclicality is currently impacting the auto insurance market, nor can we predict whether it will do so in the future. the highly competitive nature of the insurance marketplace could result in the consolidation of our competition, or in the failure of one or more competitors. the concentration of premium volume in a reduced number of major competitors could significantly alter the competitive landscape in ways that cannot be predicted, but which may or may not be favorable for progressive business prospects at that time. in addition, in the event of a failure of a major insurer or a state-sponsored catastrophic fund, we could be adversely affected, as our company and other insurance companies may be required under the laws of various jurisdictions to absorb the losses of the failed insurer or fund, and we could be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from a failed insurer former policyholders, which could strain our service capabilities in the near term. our success depends on the ability to innovate effectively, respond to our competitors initiatives, and efficiently manage complexity. from time to time, we undertake strategic initiatives to maintain and improve our competitive position in auto insurance markets. based on a culture that encourages innovation, these strategies at times involve significant departures from our, and/or our competitors , then-current or historical modes of doing business, and must be instituted in the context of a complicated regulatory environment. these innovations also may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes, and thus may add to our costs and entail a high degree of complexity and risk, which makes their implementation a challenge. in addition, our efforts may disrupt our relationships with certain of our customers and producers (i.e., agents and brokers). many of these initiatives are also implemented in cooperation with, or in reliance on, third-party vendors and their systems, which may further limit our control of implementation, quality, customer experiences, and successful outcomes. our efforts ultimately may not achieve the business goals that we have set. our ability to develop and implement such strategic initiatives that are accepted and valued by our customers and create a sustainable advantage is critical, however, to maintaining or enhancing our competitive position; if we fail to do so, or if we are unable to maintain the advantage over our competition, our business could be materially adversely affected. at the same time, innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. these developments can include product, pricing, or marketing innovations, new or improved services, technological advances, or new modes of doing business that enhance the customer ability to shop and compare prices from multiple companies, among other initiatives. the growth in mobile communications and the prominence of social media as a source of information for consumers are recent examples of significant developments in the marketplace where we are committing substantial resources. our ability to react to such advances, develop and maintain winning strategies, and then navigate the new competitive environment is important to our success. the fast pace of change and innovation in our businesses, combined with ongoing technological, regulatory, and other developments, results in significant levels of complexity in our products and in the systems and processes we use to run our business. this complexity is compounded by the proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being marketed, sold, and serviced (e.g., mobile applications), which may result in challenges to certain of our business practices by third parties, including other insurance companies and non-insurance entities, alleging that we are violating their patent rights. similarly, we may seek or obtain patent protection for innovations developed by us; enforcement of such patent rights through litigation, however, can be time consuming and is inherently uncertain, potentially complicating business plans related to these efforts. the complexity may create barriers to implementing or defending certain new ideas or providing high-quality products 15 and customer experiences, may require us to modify our business practices, and may lead to the increased possibility of error in executing our business strategies, as well as difficult management decisions regarding the allocation of available resources (such as it resources) for competing initiatives or projects. if we are unable to manage this complexity effectively, to bring new ideas to market, to allocate and prioritize appropriately our resources, or to prevent errors, our businesses could experience decreased ability to compete effectively for insurance business, poor experiences for customers, substantially increased costs, liability to third parties, regulatory investigations and sanctions, and damage to our brand. we must develop and maintain a brand that is recognized and trusted by consumers. it is critical to our business that consumers recognize and trust the progressive brand. we undertake distinctive advertising and marketing campaigns and other efforts to improve brand recognition, generate new business, and increase the retention of our current customers. we believe that improving the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns relative to those of our competitors is particularly important given the significance of brand and reputation in the marketplace and the continuing high level of advertising and marketing efforts and related expenditures within the automobile insurance market. if our campaigns are unsuccessful or are less effective than those of competitors, or if our reliance on a particular spokesperson or character is compromised, our business could be materially adversely affected. our brand could also be adversely affected by incidents that reflect negatively on our company. these situations might include, among others, failing to protect sensitive customer information, systems failures, effects of cyber attacks (such as computer hacking, data theft, system disruption, and viruses and malware), errors in handling a customer policy, inappropriate handling of claims of policyholders or other parties, misconduct by our officers, directors or employees or others acting on our behalf, inability to service outstanding policies or write new business due to our systems failures or the failure of third-party systems that we use, facility shut-downs or other causes, litigation or regulatory actions challenging our business practices, and actions by our other business partners, including unaffiliated businesses through which we offer bundled products (such as homeowners insurance), and many of the other matters that are discussed in these risk factors. moreover, the negative impacts of these or other events may be aggravated as the perceptions of consumers and others are formed based on modern communication and social media tools over which we have no control. our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented employees, managers, and executives, and to maintain appropriate staffing levels, is critical to our success. our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, compensate, motivate, and retain talented employees, including executives and other key managers. our loss of certain key officers and employees, or the failure to attract or develop talented executives and managers with diverse backgrounds and experiences, could have a materially adverse effect on our business. in addition, we must forecast sales and claims volume and other factors in changing business environments (for multiple business units and in many geographic markets) with reasonable accuracy and adjust our hiring and training programs and employment levels accordingly. our failure to recognize the need for such adjustments, or our failure or inability to react appropriately on a timely basis, could lead either to over-staffing (which would adversely affect our cost structure) or under-staffing (impairing quality and our ability to service our ongoing and new business) in one or more business units or locations. in either such event, our financial results, customer relationships, and brand could be materially adversely affected. our success also depends, in large part, on our ability to maintain and improve the staffing effectiveness and employee culture that we have developed over the years. our ability to do so may be impaired as a result of litigation against us, other judicial decisions, legislation or regulations, or other factors in the employment marketplace. in such events, the productivity of certain of our workers and the efficiency of our operations could be adversely affected, which could lead to an erosion of our operating performance and margins. the progressive corporation and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex laws and regulations. progressive insurance businesses operate in highly regulated environments. our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by state insurance departments in all 50 states, the district of columbia, and australia, each of which has a unique and complex set of laws and regulations. in addition, certain federal laws impose additional requirements on businesses, including insurers, in a wide range of areas such as the use of credit information, privacy, and the reimbursement of certain medical costs incurred by the government. our insurance subsidiaries ability to implement business plans and remain competitive while complying with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner, is and will continue to be critical to our success. most jurisdictions impose restrictions on, or require prior regulatory approval of, various actions by regulated insurers, which may adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to operate, innovate, and obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner. our compliance efforts are further complicated by changes in laws or regulations applicable to insurance companies, or by court-imposed interpretations of those laws or regulations, such as, in recent years, matters concerning the use of nonpublic consumer information and related privacy issues, the use of credit scoring in underwriting, procedures for settling claims with our insureds and claimants, and efforts to freeze, set, or roll back insurance premium rates or limit the rate of return that an insurance company may earn. insurance laws and regulations may limit, among other things, our insurance subsidiaries ability to underwrite and price risks accurately, prevent our subsidiaries from obtaining timely rate changes to recognize increased or 16 decreased costs, restrict our subsidiaries ability to discontinue unprofitable businesses or exit unprofitable markets, prevent insurers from terminating policies under certain circumstances, prescribe the form and content of certain disclosures and notices to policyholders, and dictate the types of investments that an insurance company may hold. moreover, inconsistencies between requirements at the state and federal level may further complicate our compliance efforts, potentially resulting in additional costs being imposed on us. in addition, laws in certain jurisdictions mandate that insurance companies pay assessments in a number of circumstances, including assessments to pay claims upon the insolvency of other insurance companies or to cover losses in government-provided insurance programs for high risk auto and homeowners coverages. compliance with laws and regulations often results in increased costs, which can be substantial, to our insurance subsidiaries. these costs, in turn, may adversely affect our profitability or our ability or desire to grow or operate our business in the applicable jurisdictions. the actual or alleged failure to comply with this complex variety of laws and regulations by us or other companies in the insurance, financial services, or related industries, also could result in actions or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, federal officials, or other law enforcement officials. such actions and investigations, and any determination that we have not complied with an applicable law or regulation, could potentially lead to significant monetary payments, fines and penalties, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation in the marketplace, and in extreme cases, revocation of a subsidiary authority to do business in one or more jurisdictions. in addition, the progressive corporation and its subsidiaries could face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations. new legislation or regulations may be adopted in the future which could adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. from time to time, the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. for example, the federal insurance office (fio) collects information about the insurance industry and monitors the industry for systemic risk. if the fio were to recommend to the financial stability oversight council that progressive or the insurance industry as a whole is systemically significant, we could be subject to additional regulation, and our businesses could be affected significantly. at this time, we are unable to predict whether any additional federal laws or regulations will be enacted and how and to what extent such laws and regulations would affect our businesses. insurance regulation may create risks and uncertainties for progressive insurance subsidiaries in other ways as well. for further information on these risks and uncertainties, see the insurance regulation discussion beginning on page 5 of this report. our success depends on our ability to adjust claims accurately. we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our insurance policies. many factors can affect our ability to pay claims accurately, including the training, experience, and skill of our claims representatives, the extent of and our ability to recognize and respond to fraudulent or inflated claims, the claims organization culture and the effectiveness of its management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures, technologies, and systems to support our claims functions, and the success of our concierge level claims services program. our failure to pay claims fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner, or to deploy claims resources appropriately, could result in unanticipated costs to us, lead to material litigation, undermine customer goodwill and our reputation in the marketplace, and impair our brand image and, as a result, materially adversely affect our competitiveness, financial results, prospects, and liquidity. lawsuits challenging our business practices, and those of our competitors and other companies, are pending and more may be filed in the future. the progressive corporation and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of the subsidiaries business operations. other such litigation may arise in the future concerning similar or other business practices. these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of our subsidiaries use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the u.s. fair credit reporting act; methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury, personal injury protection, and medical payment claims; other claims handling procedures; challenges to our direct repair program and service center program; interpretations of the provisions of our insurance policies; and policy implementation and renewal procedures, among other matters. from time to time, we also may be involved in litigation or other disputes alleging that certain of our subsidiaries business practices or systems violate the patent, trademark, or other intellectual property rights of third parties. additional litigation may be filed against us concerning our employment-related practices, allegations of medical or attorney malpractice, and other general liability causes of action arising from our operations. in addition, lawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed in the future, against our competitors and other businesses, and although we are not a party to such litigation, the results of those cases may create additional risks for, and/or impose additional costs, and/or limitations on, our subsidiaries business operations. lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages and injunctive relief. the potential for injunctive relief can threaten our use of important business practices, including how vehicles are repaired and other claims are settled. moreover, the resolution of individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields may lead to a new layer of court-imposed regulation, resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business. litigation is inherently unpredictable. except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us, we are unable to predict the effect, if any, that these pending or any future lawsuits may have on our 17 business, operations, profitability, or financial condition. for further information on pending litigation, see note 12 litigation in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k. our business could be materially and adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors. our business requires that we build and maintain large and complex computer systems to run our operations and to store the significant volume of data that we acquire, including the personal confidential information of our customers and employees and our intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive business and financial information. these systems are subject to attacks by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities. such attacks may include, among other things, attempts to gain unauthorized access to: steal, corrupt, or destroy data misappropriate funds disrupt or shut down our systems deny customers or others access to our systems, or infect our systems with viruses or malware. similarly, an employee, consultant, agent, or other person with legitimate access to our systems may take actions, or be the subject of a security breach or cyber attack, which could result in improper or unauthorized access to our systems, and in the loss, corruption, or theft of our intellectual property or the personal information of our customers or employees. we also conduct significant business functions and computer operations using the systems of third-party vendors, which may provide software, data storage, and other computer services to us (some of which may be referred to as cloud computing ). these third-party systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches, along with the possible risk of loss, corruption, or unauthorized publication of progressive information or the confidential information of our customers and employees. these relationships present further risk management challenges for us, including, among others: confirming and monitoring the third-party security measures; the potential for improper handling of or access to, or the inability to retrieve, our data; and data location uncertainty and the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions, where laws or security measures may be inadequate. we undertake substantial efforts to protect our systems and sensitive or confidential information. these efforts include internal processes and technological defenses that are preventative or detective, and other controls designed to provide multiple layers of security assurance. examples include physical security measures, access and password policies, firewalls, systems monitoring, malicious code protection, network and host-based intrusion detection and prevention measures, data loss prevention measures, configuration assurance, data encryption, and event management, as well as third party intrusion vulnerability testing. in addition, we seek to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation, security and financial due diligence, contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards, and ongoing testing, auditing, and evaluation of third-party compliance with the required standards. while we expend significant resources on these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks or detecting and stopping them once they have begun. our business could be significantly damaged by a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack. in addition to the potentially high costs of investigating and stopping such an event and implementing necessary fixes, we could incur substantial liability if confidential customer information is stolen or if another party systems are adversely affected. in addition, such an event could cause a significant disruption of our ability to conduct our insurance operations, adversely affect our competitive position if material trade secrets or other confidential information are stolen, and have severe ramifications on our reputation and brand, potentially causing customers to refrain from buying insurance from us or other businesses to refrain from doing business with us. we have elected to self-insure these risks at this time. the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity. we also rely heavily on credit card acceptance for payment of premiums and claims deductibles. data security standards for merchants and service providers that accept credit card payments are prescribed by the payment card industry security standards council (pci), an independent body formed by an association of the major credit card vendors. these standards are intended to promote a common set of data security measures that companies accepting credit card payments, such as progressive, must satisfy with respect to the handling of sensitive information. while the pci standards set a high bar for data security, compliance with them does not alone ensure that sensitive information will be maintained on a secure basis. in august 2012, an independent organization recognized by pci for such purposes, recertified progressive as being in compliance with the current pci standards. the pci data security standards, however, will likely evolve over time to address emerging payment security risks and other issues, requiring additional compliance efforts by us and annual recertification of our processes. our intention is to maintain compliance with pci data security standards. the failure to do so could result in contractual fines or disruption of our ability to receive credit card payments. 18 our business depends on the secure and uninterrupted operation of our facilities, systems, and business functions. our business is highly dependent upon our employees ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, necessary business functions (such as internet support and 24-hour call centers), processing new and renewal business, and processing and paying claims and other obligations. our facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including, without limitation, natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks (as discussed above), riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics, utility outages, interruptions of our data processing and storage systems or the systems of third-party vendors, or unavailability of communications facilities. likewise, we could experience a failure or corruption of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including failures that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. the shut-down or unavailability of one or more of our systems or facilities for any reason could significantly impair our ability to perform critical business functions on a timely basis. in addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. if sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner, or perform other necessary business functions. this could result in a materially adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity, as well as damage to customer goodwill. our business is also highly dependent on access to, and the operation of, the financial markets and related facilities to provide us with the ability to liquidate securities and transfer or receive funds on a timely basis. disruptions in financial markets, or an interruption or breakdown in the federal wire transfer systems, could limit our ability to meet payment obligations. a mismatch or timing difference between our cash inflows and our cash needs, or the inability to convert investment securities into cash when needed, could also adversely affect our ability to make timely payments. iii. market risks the performance of our fixed-income and equity investment portfolios is subject to a variety of investment risks. our investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed-income securities and common equities. our fixed-income portfolio is actively managed by our investment group and includes short-term investments, fixed-maturity securities, and preferred stocks. the performance of the fixed-income portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including: interest rate risk the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed-income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates. investment credit risk the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of asset-backed securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss. in the case of governmental issuers, the risk includes the potential for unbalanced budgets, required austerity measures, debt defaults, or other social or political turmoil. concentration risk the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries, which could result in a significant decrease in the value of the portfolio in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition or performance of, or outlook for, those issuers, sectors, or industries. prepayment or extension risk (applicable to certain securities in the portfolio, such as residential mortgage-backed securities) the risk that, as interest rates change, the principal of such securities may be repaid earlier than anticipated, or that a security may not be redeemed when anticipated, adversely affecting the value of, or income from, such securities and the portfolio by investing at less attractive rates. liquidity risk the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when we desire to do so. disruptions in the financial markets, or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us. investments in securities that are not publicly traded are illiquid by their nature. in addition, the success of our investment strategies and asset allocations in the fixed-income portfolio may vary depending on the market environment. the fixed-income portfolio performance also may be adversely impacted if, among other factors: there is a lack of transparency regarding the underlying businesses of the issuers of the securities that we purchase; credit ratings assigned to such securities by nationally recognized securities rating organizations are based on incomplete or inaccurate information or otherwise prove unwarranted; or our risk mitigation strategies are ineffective for the applicable market conditions. the common equity portfolio is primarily managed by a third party to track the russell 1000 index, with a small portion actively managed by external investment advisory firms. our equity investments are subject to general movements in the values of equity markets and to the changes in the prices of the securities we hold. an investment portfolio that is designed to track an index, such as the russell 1000, or that follows a specific investment discipline, such as value investing, does not reduce the risks inherent in equity investing and is not necessarily less risky than other equity investment strategies. equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may be subject to high volatility and to long periods of depressed or declining valuations, and also may be 19 subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed-income portfolio, as discussed above. for example, a rapid rise in interest rates may cause equity prices to fall, particularly those of interest-sensitive companies. in addition, even though the russell 1000 index is broadly diversified, significant portions of the index may be concentrated in one or more sectors, such as the financial services industry, which may adversely affect the performance of our common equity portfolio if such a sector underperforms. a decline in the aggregate value of the equities that make up the index would be expected to result in a commensurate decline both in the value of our common equity portfolio and in our capital. likewise, the actively managed equity portfolio will be subject to risks arising from the investment decisions of the investment advisors, including sector or industry concentrations, lack of geographic diversification, and the performance of individual issuers. both the fixed-income and the common equity portfolios are also subject to risks inherent in the nation and world capital markets. the functioning of those markets, the values of the investments we hold, and our ability to liquidate them when desired may be adversely affected if those markets are disrupted or otherwise affected by significant negative factors, including, without limitation: local, national, or international events, such as regulatory changes, power outages, system failures, wars, or terrorist attacks a recession, depression, political or social upheaval, or other development in either the u.s. or other economies that adversely affects the value of securities held in our portfolios financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and impact our ability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired the failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize their budgets or economies through austerity programs, tax increases or other measures, to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets, or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth, or the failure or refusal of a government to engage in such efforts investor fear, whether substantiated or not, causing the market to react irrationally a significant change in inflation expectations, or the onset of deflation or stagflation a default on sovereign debt, or the perception that such a default is likely, and a significant devaluation of governmental or private sector credit, currencies or financial markets, or other factors or events. if the fixed-income or equity portfolios, or both, were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector, or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial position, and financial results could be materially adversely affected. under these circumstances, our income from these investments could be materially reduced, and declines in the value of certain securities could further reduce our reported earnings and capital levels. a decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary ability to write new business. if we, at that time, are unable to supplement the subsidiary capital from the progressive corporation other assets or by issuing debt or equity securities on acceptable terms, our business could be materially adversely affected. see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report, which is included as exhibit 13 to this form 10-k, for additional discussion of the composition of our investment portfolio as of december 31, 2012, and of the market risk associated with our investment portfolio. iv. credit risks our financial condition may be adversely affected if one or more parties with which we enter into significant contracts become insolvent, experience other financial difficulties, or default in the performance of contractual obligations. our business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under various contractual or service arrangements. these include, for example, contracts for the acquisition of goods and services (such as telecommunications and information technology facilities, equipment and support, and other systems and services that are integral to our operations), agreements with other insurance carriers to bundle products that we do not offer, and arrangements for transferring certain of our risks (including reinsurance used by us in connection with certain of our insurance products and our corporate insurance policies). in addition, from time to time, we enter into significant financial transactions, such as derivative instruments, with major banks or other financial institutions. if one or more of these parties were to default in the performance of their obligations under their respective contracts or determine to abandon or terminate support for a system, product, or service that is significant to our business, we could suffer significant financial losses and operational interruptions or other problems, which could in turn adversely affect our financial performance, cash flows, or results of operations and cause damage to our brand and reputation. 20 our insurance subsidiaries may be limited in the amount of dividends that they can pay to the holding company, which in turn may limit the holding company ability to pay dividends to shareholders, repurchase its securities, repay indebtedness, or make capital contributions to its other subsidiaries or affiliates. the progressive corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own. consequently, if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make other distributions to the progressive corporation, or are able to pay only limited amounts, progressive may be unable to pay dividends to shareholders, make payments on its indebtedness, meet its other obligations, repurchase its common shares or other securities, or make capital contributions to or otherwise fund its subsidiaries or affiliates. each insurance subsidiary ability to pay dividends to the holding company may be limited by one or more of the following factors: insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified minimum levels of statutory capital and surplus insurance regulations restrict the amounts available for distribution based on either net income or surplus of the insurance company competitive pressures require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain high financial strength ratings, or in certain jurisdictions, prior approval must be obtained from regulatory authorities for the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to affiliated entities, including the parent holding company. further information on insurance laws and regulations that may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends can be found in item 5(c), dividends, of this report. if we fail to maintain sufficient capital to support our business, our financial condition and our ability to grow could be adversely affected. we intend to maintain capital levels as necessary to pay all claims and other business expenses, to meet regulatory requirements, to support the growth of our insurance businesses, to provide for additional protection against possible large, unexpected losses, and to provide the necessary resources to pay dividends, repurchase stock or other securities, and fund corporate opportunities. the appropriate level of capital at any time is estimated by management based, in part, on current and anticipated business results and growth prospects, and projections of the levels of capital needed to protect us against unexpected events within a confidence level determined through our risk management process. the amount of capital that we seek to maintain also is driven by our assessment of potential exposures and correlations to our underwriting, investing, and operating risks, including those discussed in these risk factors. the estimates for unexpected events are internally produced and are the result of extensive analysis and modeling of the types and magnitude of risks that we are likely to face. while we regularly implement new measures to improve our techniques for estimating our capital needs, our ability to predict accurately the nature, size, and scope of unexpected events is inherently uncertain. the amount of capital that we hold at any given time is determined by regulatory requirements and the performance of our insurance operations and investment results (including investment income, valuation changes in our portfolio, and the realization of any deferred tax benefits), as well as by our capital management activities, such as the payment of cash dividends, repurchases of our common shares and debt securities, the establishment of credit lines, and the issuance by us of debt, equity, or other securities. if we experience losses in our insurance operations or from our investment portfolio, our capital levels may be reduced, perhaps significantly. if our capital level falls lower than the amount needed at a given time, our ability to grow and successfully operate the insurance business could be constrained until additional sources of capital are secured. such a deterioration of our financial condition could adversely affect the perception of our company by insurance regulators and other third parties (such as rating agencies, underwriters, institutional and other investors, and consumers), potentially resulting in regulatory actions or our inability to gain access to debt or equity markets at favorable rates, and the price of our common shares or debt securities could fall significantly. in addition, the recoverability of certain of our deferred tax assets is predicated on the market valuation of our invested assets and certain tax planning strategies that, in part, depend on the substantial recovery to original cost of our fixed-income securities and redeemable preferred stocks. should fair values of such securities decline or not substantially recover in value, a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets may become necessary, which would reduce our capital levels. our access to capital markets, ability to enter into new or renew existing financing arrangements, obligations to post collateral under certain derivative contracts, and business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies. our credit and financial strength are evaluated and rated by various rating agencies, such as standard &amp; poor s, moody investors service, fitch ratings, and a.m. best. progressive and its insurance subsidiaries currently enjoy favorable, stable ratings. downgrades in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets and/or lead to increased borrowing costs in the future (although the interest rates we pay on our current indebtedness would not be affected), as would adverse recommendations by equity analysts at the various brokerage houses and investment firms. perceptions of our company by investors, producers, other businesses, and consumers could also be significantly impaired. in addition, a downgrade could trigger contractual obligations in certain derivative transactions requiring us to post substantial amounts of collateral, in cash or high-grade assets, for the benefit of the other party to the transaction. downgrades in the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries 21 could likewise negatively impact our operations, potentially resulting in lower or negative premium growth. in any such event, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected. the progressive corporation annual dividend policy will result in a variable payment to shareholders each year, or no payment in some years, and the dividend program ultimately may be changed in the discretion of the board of directors. we have previously announced our intention to pay a dividend to shareholders on an annual basis under a formula that multiplies our annual after-tax underwriting income by a percentage factor set by the board of directors (33-1/3% for 2012 and 2013) and then by the gainshare factor (determined under our employee gainsharing (cash bonus) plans based on the operating performance of our principal insurance businesses). if our gainshare factor for the year is zero or after-tax comprehensive income (which includes net investment income, realized investment gains and losses, and the change in unrealized investment gains and losses) is less than after-tax underwriting income, no dividend will be paid under our annual variable dividend policy. because the dividend calculation is performance-based, the amount (if any) to be paid in any particular year may not be subject to accurate prediction and will likely vary, perhaps significantly, from the amounts paid in the preceding year(s). as a result, the amount paid may be inconsistent with some shareholders expectations. in addition, although we have announced our intent to repeat the annual dividend in 2013 (to be paid early in 2014), the dividend, if any, would not be declared by the board until late 2013 or early 2014, and the board retains the discretion, at any time, to alter our policy or not to pay the annual dividend for 2013 or future years. such an action by the board could result from, among other reasons, changes in the insurance marketplace, changes in our performance or capital needs, changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, disruptions of national or international capital markets, or other events affecting our liquidity or financial position as described above under investing risks. any such change could adversely affect investors perceptions of the company and the value of, or the total return of an investment in, our common shares or debt securities. we do not manage to short-term earnings expectations; our goal is to maximize the long-term value of the enterprise, which at times may adversely affect short-term results. we believe that shareholder value will be increased in the long run if we meet or exceed the financial goals and policies that we establish each year. we do not manage our business to maximize short-term stock performance or the amount of the dividend that may be paid under our annual variable dividend policy or otherwise. we report earnings and other operating results on a monthly basis. we also do not provide earnings estimates to the market and do not comment on earnings estimates by analysts. as a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary, perhaps significantly, from investors expectations, which could result in significant volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. in addition, due to our focus on the long-term value of the enterprise, we may undertake business strategies and establish related financial goals for a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, while understanding that such strategies may not always similarly benefit short-term results, such as our annual underwriting profit or earnings per share. such strategies, for example, may involve a reduction in premiums for certain products or customers, or increases in advertising spend, to support growth or enhance retention of current customers. consequently, these strategies may adversely affect short-term performance or the amount of our variable dividend for a given year, and may result in additional volatility in the price of our common shares or debt securities. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the quantitative and qualitative
