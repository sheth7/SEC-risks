risk factors 7 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we operate in a highly competitive industry. the marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative, marketing or media services, to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets. new market participants include database marketing and modeling companies, telemarketers and internet companies. the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be important competitive considerations. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and clients may choose to terminate their contracts on a relatively short timeframe. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 22% of revenue in 2011 . a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. while we have seen economic recovery in most of our key markets during 2011 , the strength and duration of the recovery has varied across geographic regions, and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services. in particular, the uneven pace of recovery in certain european markets has contributed to concerns over future growth in these markets. in 2011, continental europe and the united kingdom accounted for 13.0% and 7.7% of our revenue, respectively. the marketing services industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy generally. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. for example, we experienced a 10.8% organic revenue decline during 2009. this pattern may recur in the future. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations. 7 we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. similarly, we may not realize the intended advantages of past or future investments or acquisitions of businesses because we may incorrectly evaluate risks and benefits from these transactions, or have unforeseen difficulties integrating them into our organization. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility (as amended and restated as of may 31, 2011, the credit agreement ). the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated. furthermore, the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions, and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution's commitment, the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced. if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 45% in 2011 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, and difficult local political or economic conditions. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro, japanese yen and pound sterling, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. concerns persist in europe in particular over the debt burdens of certain countries that use the euro as their currency and the overall stability of the euro. possible consequences, such as the re-introduction of individual currencies in countries currently employing the euro or the dissolution of the euro as a common currency, or market perceptions and uncertainties about the possibility and impact of such events, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and results of operations. if our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. for a description of our client base, see clients in item 1, business. 8 we are subject to regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or our financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based and digital marketing. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking controversial work that may be challenged by consumer groups. we rely extensively on information technology systems. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including recording marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown, malicious intrusion or random attack. likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the public generally. any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or data-protection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2011 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.4 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. we can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations, because the majority of our debt (approximately 91% and 93% as of december 31, 2011 and 2010 , respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10% change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/(decrease) in fair market value 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2011 $ (7.4 ) $ 7.7 2010 (14.4 ) 14.0 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. during 2011 , we entered into and exited interest rate swaps related to our 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2014 and do not have any such swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2011 . we had $2,315.6 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2011 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term investment-grade securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2011 and 2010 , we had interest income of $37.8 and $28.7 , respectively. based on our 2011 results, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $23.0 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were affected in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2011 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2011 were the australian dollar, brazilian real, euro, japanese yen and pound sterling. based on 2011 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3% and 5% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2011 current levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. our venezuela agencies transitioned to inflationary accounting on january 1, 2010, and as a result, we recorded a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 in 2010 . this charge was recorded in office and general expenses within the consolidated 35 statements of operations. in 2010 we re-measured our local non-monetary transactions, assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 4.3 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per u.s. dollar. subsequent to the currency re-measurement, this devaluation did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as we do not have significant operations in venezuela. credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our excess cash in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 36risk factors 6 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could

win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants. the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be

limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to decrease when economic conditions are unfavorable. economic conditions continue to vary across geographic regions, and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services. the marketing services industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than

develop the appropriate talent, and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a $1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility (the credit agreement ). if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration. furthermore, the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions, and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution's commitment, the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced. in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. although to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients, if clients are unable to pay for commitments we have entered into on their behalf there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow. furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . 7 international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 45% in 2012 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, and difficult local political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen, pound sterling and south african rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s.

could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial. we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments. we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or 8 acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we rely extensively on information technology systems. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown, malicious intrusion or random attack. likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the public generally. any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or data-protection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2012 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.6 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized.

december 31, 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2012 $ (27.5 ) $ 28.4 2011 (7.4 ) 7.7 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. during 2012 , we entered into and exited forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in the benchmark rate related to our 3.75% senior notes due 2023, which we issued in november 2012. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2012 . we had $2,590.8 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2012 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term investment-grade securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2012 and 2011 , we had interest income of $29.5 and $37.8 , respectively. based on our 2012 results, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $26.0 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2012 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2012 were the brazilian real, euro, indian rupee and the south african rand. based on 2012 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3% and 5% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2012 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of

currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. our venezuela agencies transitioned to inflationary accounting on january 1, 2010, and as a result, we recorded a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 in 2010. this charge was recorded in office and general expenses within the consolidated 34 statements of operations. in 2010, we re-measured our local non-monetary transactions, assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 4.3 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per u.s. dollar. subsequent to the currency re-measurement, this devaluation did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as we do not have significant operations in venezuela. credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 35risk factors 6 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . 6 we operate in a highly competitive industry. the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative, marketing or media services, to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants. the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be important competitive considerations. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and clients may choose to terminate their contracts on a relatively short timeframe. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 21% of revenue in 2013 . a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. our results of operations are highly susceptible to decrease when economic conditions are unfavorable. economic conditions continue to vary across geographic regions, and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy or economic conditions in certain regions, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. the industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy generally. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent, and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a $1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility (the credit agreement ). if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration. furthermore, the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions, and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution's commitment, the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced. 7 in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues, and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. although to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients, if clients are unable to pay for commitments we have entered into on their behalf there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow. furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 44% in 2013 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, and difficult local political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen, pound sterling and south african rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. concerns persist in europe in particular over the debt burdens of certain countries that use the euro as their currency and the overall stability of the euro. possible consequences, such as the re-introduction of individual currencies in countries currently employing the euro or the dissolution of the euro as a common currency, or market perceptions and uncertainties about the possibility and impact of such events, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and results of operations. if our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. for a description of our client base, see clients in item 1, business . we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or our financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based and digital marketing. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial. we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments. we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase 8 payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we rely extensively on information technology systems. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown, malicious intrusion or random attack. likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the public generally. any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or data-protection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2013 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.6 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. we can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 34 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 89% and 93% as of december 31, 2013 and 2012 , respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/(decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2013 $ (26.9 ) $ 27.9 2012 (27.5 ) 28.4 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2013 . we had $1,642.1 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2013 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2013 and 2012 , we had interest income of $24.7 and $29.5 , respectively. based on our 2013 results, a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $16.4 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2013 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2013 were the australian dollar, brazilian real, euro, japanese yen and the south african rand. based on 2013 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3% and 4% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2013 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. 34 credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 35risk factors 6 risk factors we are subject to a variety

in fair market value as of december 31, 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2014 $ (35.5 ) $ 36.6 2013 (26.9 ) 27.9 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2014 . we had $1,667.2 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2014 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2014 and 2013 , we had interest income of $27.4 and $24.7 , respectively. based on our 2014 results, a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $16.7 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2014 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2014 included the argentine peso, australian dollar, brazilian real and british pound sterling. based on 2014 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2014 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. 34 credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 35risk factors 7 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . we operate in a highly competitive industry. the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative, marketing or media services, to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants. the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited, and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor. clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our clients may choose to terminate their contracts, or reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 19% of revenue in 2015 . a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest, or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions. we are exposed to risks associated with weak regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets. the global economy continues to be volatile. uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 7 if our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. furthermore, in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. to the extent possible, we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. however, if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf, or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms, there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business, with agencies located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 41% in 2015 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions and difficult social, political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the argentine peso, australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chilean peso, euro, indian rupee, japanese yen and south african rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies, including the persistent strength of the u.s. dollar in recent periods, may adversely affect our financial results. we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based and digital marketing. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial. we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments. we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than 8 anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and digital products and processing business transactions. the incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns, malicious intrusions or attacks. likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. we operate worldwide, and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex, conflicting, unclear or ever-changing. we also utilize third parties, including third-party cloud computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients' or vendors' proprietary information and damage our reputation. efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2015 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.6 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a $1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility (the credit agreement ). if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of 9 the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration. furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates, we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. the costs of compliance with sustainability or other social responsibility laws, regulations or policies, including client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business. although as a non-manufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns, we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients. increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation. further, if clients' costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations, this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services. we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate change-related costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 89% and 91% as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/(decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2015 $ (33.7 ) $ 34.7 2014 (35.5 ) 36.6 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2015 . we had $1,509.7 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2015 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2015 and 2014 , we had interest income of $22.8 and $27.4 , respectively. based on our 2015 results, a 100-basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $15.0 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2015 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015 included the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling and euro. based on 2015 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. 35 credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 36risk factors 7 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . we operate in a highly competitive industry. the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative, marketing or media services, to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants. the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited, and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor. clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our clients may choose to terminate their contracts, or reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20% of revenue in 2016 . a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest, or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions. we are exposed to risks associated with weak regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets. the global economy continues to be volatile. uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control. changes to u.s. or other immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 7 if our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. furthermore, in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. to the extent possible, we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. however, if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf, or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms, there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business, with agencies located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 40% in 2016 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions and difficult social, political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic sanctions, which can be complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm. given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe, we face uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the u.k.'s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom's exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. it is possible that brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including our relationships with existing and future clients, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro, indian rupee and japanese yen, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies, including the persistent strength of the u.s. dollar in recent periods, may adversely affect our financial results. in particular, brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling. we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based and digital marketing. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial. we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments. we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful 8 in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and digital products, and processing business transactions. the incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns, malicious intrusions or attacks. likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. we operate worldwide, and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex, conflicting, unclear or ever-changing. we also utilize third parties, including third-party cloud computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients' or vendors' proprietary information and damage our reputation. efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2016 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.7 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . 9 our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a $1 billion committed credit facility (the credit agreement ) to increase our financial flexibility. if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration. furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates, we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. the costs of compliance with sustainability or other social responsibility laws, regulations or policies, including client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business. although as a non-manufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns, we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients. increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation. further, if clients' costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations, this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services. we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate change-related costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 93% and 89% as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/(decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2016 $ (26.3 ) $ 26.9 2015 (33.7 ) 34.7 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2016 . we had $1,100.6 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2016 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2016 and 2015 , we had interest income of $20.1 and $22.8 , respectively. based on our 2016 results, a 100 basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $11.0 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2016 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the foreign currencies that most impacted our results during 2016 included the british pound sterling and, to a lesser extent, the argentine peso, brazilian real and japanese yen. based on 2016 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2016 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. 33 credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 34risk factors 9 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . we operate in a highly competitive industry. the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative, marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants. competitive challenges also arise from rapidly-evolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space, creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools, technologies and process improvements. the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited, and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor. clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our clients may choose to terminate their contracts, or reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20% of revenue in 2017 . a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest, or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions. we are exposed to risks associated with weak regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets. the global economy continues to be challenging in some parts of the world. uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control. changes to u.s. or other immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 9 if our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. furthermore, in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. to the extent possible, we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. however, if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf, or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms, there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business, with agencies located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 40% in 2017 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility, and difficult social, political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa and the u.k. anti-bribery act (2010), which can be comprehensive, complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate. export controls and economic sanctions, such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the u.s. department of the treasury, can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients. these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm. given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe, we face uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the u.k.'s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom's exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. it is possible that brexit and changes resulting from brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including our relationships with existing and future clients, suppliers and employees, and the potential impact of increased restrictions on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services between the united kingdom and the remaining members of the european union, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro and indian rupee, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies, including the persistent strength of the u.s. dollar in recent periods, may adversely affect our financial results. in particular, brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling. we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based and digital marketing. the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations, such as the gdpr, or changes in interpretations of current ones. any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements, or their application in an unanticipated manner, could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may 10 hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. governmental action, including judicial rulings, on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial. we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments. we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, developing new business opportunities and digital products, and processing business transactions. the incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns, malicious intrusions or attacks. likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. we operate worldwide, and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex, conflicting, unclear or ever-changing. we also utilize third parties, including third-party cloud computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients' or vendors' proprietary information and damage our reputation. efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2017 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.8 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our 11 reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a $1.5 billion committed corporate credit facility (the credit agreement ) to increase our financial flexibility. we also maintain a commercial paper program under which we are authorized to issue short-term debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion, which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes. borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement. if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration. furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates, we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors. our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient short-term debt ratings, and any downgrades to those ratings could reduce the market capacity for, or our ability to issue, commercial paper. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. the costs of compliance with sustainability or other social responsibility laws, regulations or policies, including client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business. although as a non-manufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns, we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients. increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation. further, if clients' costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations, this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services. we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate change-related costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers. 12 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks.

to changes in interest rates. we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2017 . we had $791.0 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2017 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2017 and 2016 , we had interest income of $19.4 and $20.1 , respectively. based on our 2017 results, a 100 basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $7.9 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2017 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either

and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 37risk factors 9 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . we operate in a highly competitive industry. the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive and constantly changing. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative, marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants. competitive challenges also arise from rapidly-evolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space, creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools, technologies and process improvements. as data-driven marketing solutions become increasingly core to the success of our brands, any failure to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and standards in this space could harm our competitive position. the client's perception of the quality of our agencies' creative work, its confidence in our ability to protect the confidentiality of their and their customers' data and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services and technologies may also be an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited, and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor. clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our clients may choose to terminate their contracts, or reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 18% of revenue in 2018 . a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest, or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions. we are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets. the global economy continues to be challenging in some markets. uncertainty about the continued strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and factors which may be beyond our control. changes to u.s. or other immigration 9 policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility and significant use of third-party or temporary workers to staff new, growing or temporary assignments. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, or fail to manage our workforce effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. if our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. furthermore, in most of our businesses, our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients. the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable, expenditures billable to clients, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. to the extent possible, we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. however, if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf, or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms, there could be an adverse effect on our working capital, which would negatively impact our operating cash flow. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business, with agencies located in over 110 countries, including every significant world market. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 40% in 2018 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility, and difficult social, political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa and the u.k. anti-bribery act (2010), which can be comprehensive, complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate, certain of which present heightened compliance challenges. export controls and economic sanctions, such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the u.s. department of the treasury, can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients. these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm. given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe, we face continued uncertainty surrounding the form and consequences of the implementation of the u.k.'s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom's exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. it is possible that brexit and changes resulting from brexit, particularly in the event the u.k. and the european union fail to come to an agreement on the terms of the u.k. exit, will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities and negative economic impacts. these impacts and any increased restrictions on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services between the united kingdom and the remaining members of the european union, could create uncertainty surrounding our business, including our relationships with existing and future clients, suppliers and employees, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro and indian rupee, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies, including the persistent strength of the u.s. dollar in recent periods, may adversely affect our financial results. in particular, brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the u.s. dollar and the british pound sterling. we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. 10 existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based, digital and targeted marketing. we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can transfer, process or receive certain data that we use in our operations. the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations, such as the gdpr and the ccpa, or changes in interpretations of current ones, such as the interpretation of existing consumer protection laws as imposing restrictions on the online collection, storage and use of personal data. if we are unable to transfer data between countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results. any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements, or their application in an unanticipated manner, could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. governmental action, including judicial rulings, on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial. we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments. we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients. on october 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of acxiom for approximately $2.3 billion , including customary closing adjustments. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, develop new business opportunities and digital products, and process business transactions. the incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, phishing attacks and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education. our business, which increasingly involves the collection, use and transmission of customer data, may make us and our agencies attractive targets for malicious third-party attempts to access this data. power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns, malicious intrusions or attacks. 11 likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. we operate worldwide, and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex, conflicting, unclear or ever-changing. we also utilize third parties, including third-party cloud computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients' or vendors' proprietary information and damage our reputation. efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2018 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $4.9 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a $1.5 billion committed corporate credit facility (the credit agreement ) to increase our financial flexibility. we also maintain a commercial paper program under which we are authorized to issue short-term debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion, which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes. borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement. if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement and the $500 million term loan we entered into to provide financing for the acxiom acquisition (the term loan ) each contain financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement and the term loan, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under these agreements could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement and the term loan could be terminated, and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration. furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . in connection with the acxiom acquisition, we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt. on october 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of acxiom for approximately $2.3 billion, including customary closing adjustments. the indebtedness we incurred to fund the acxiom acquisition significantly increased our outstanding debt levels and will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt. as of december 31, 2018, $1.4 billion of 12 this new indebtedness matures within three years. if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our credit facilities or the debt securities we issued in connection with the acquisition, we may be required to refinance, restructure or otherwise amend some or all of our obligations, sell assets or raise additional cash through the sale of our common stock or convertible securities. we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain refinancing on terms as favorable as our current financing or that any restructuring, sales of assets or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet our obligations. if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, that issuance could also result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates, we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors. our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient short-term debt ratings, and any downgrades to those ratings could reduce the market capacity for, or our ability to issue, commercial paper. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. the costs of compliance with sustainability or other social responsibility laws, regulations or policies, including client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business. although as a non-manufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns, we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients. increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation. further, if clients' costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations, this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services. we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate change-related costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers. 13 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 86% and 94% as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/(decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2018 $ (91.3 ) $ 82.5 2017 (20.2 ) 20.6 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31, 2018 . we had $673.5 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2018 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2018 and 2017 , we had interest income of $21.8 and $19.4 , respectively. based on our 2018 results, a 100 basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $6.7 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2018 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the foreign currencies that most favorably impacted our results during the year ended december 31, 2018 were the euro and british pound sterling. the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31, of 2018 were the argentine peso and brazilian real. based on 2018 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2018 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. 38 credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts receivable billable to clients. we invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 39risk factors 9 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . we operate in a highly competitive industry. the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive and constantly changing. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative, marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional

affect our competitive position. an agency's ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services and technologies may also be an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency's principal asset is its people and freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited, our relationships with clients can be affected by the departure of key personnel and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client's account from a much larger competitor. clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time, and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our clients may choose to terminate their contracts, or reduce their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 17% of revenue in 2019 . a substantial decline in a large client's advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients' policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest, or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions. we are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and disruption in the financial markets. the global economy continues to be challenging in some markets. uncertainty about the continued strength of the global economy generally, or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors, and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers, can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. in addition, market conditions can be adversely affected by natural and human disruptions, such as natural disasters, severe weather events, military conflict or public health crises. our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. 9 table of contents our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award and factors which may be beyond our control. changes to u.s. or other immigration policies or travel restrictions imposed as a result of public health, political or security concerns, that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility and significant use of third-party or temporary workers to staff new, growing or temporary assignments. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, or fail to manage our workforce effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. if our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible

business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business, with agencies located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our net revenues, approximately 38% in 2019 . these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility, large-scale local or regional public health crises, and other difficult social, political or economic conditions. we also must comply with applicable u.s., local and other international anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa and the u.k. anti-bribery act (2010), which can be comprehensive, complex and stringent, in all jurisdictions where we operate, certain of which present heightened compliance challenges. export controls and economic sanctions, such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the u.s. department of the treasury, can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients. these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm. given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe, we face continued uncertainty surrounding the implementation and consequences of the u.k.'s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom's exit from the european union, commonly referred to as brexit. under the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the u.k. and the e.u., the u.k. as of january 31, 2020, is no longer a member of the european union, and a transitional period will occur through december 31, 2020, during which the parties intend to negotiate the terms of their future economic and trade relationship. during and following this transitional period, it is possible that brexit and changes resulting from brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities, large exchange rate fluctuations and negative economic impacts. these impacts and any increased restrictions on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services between the united kingdom and the remaining members of the european union, could create uncertainty surrounding our business, including our relationships with existing and future clients, suppliers and employees, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, british pound sterling, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro and indian rupee, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies, including the persistent strength of the u.s. dollar in recent periods, may adversely affect our financial results. 10 table of contents we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. existing and proposed laws and regulations, in particular in the european union and the united states, concerning user privacy, use of personal information and on-line tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internet-based, digital and targeted marketing. we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can transfer, process or receive certain data that we use in our operations. the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations, such as the gdpr and the ccpa, or changes in interpretations of current ones, such as the interpretation of existing consumer protection laws as imposing restrictions on the online collection, storage and use of personal data. the imposition of restrictions on certain technologies by private market participants in response to privacy concerns could also have a negative impact on our digital business. if we are unable to transfer data between countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results. any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements, or their application in an unanticipated manner, could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol, tobacco or marijuana products, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients' goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. governmental action, including judicial rulings, on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial. we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments. we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients, such as our acquisition of acxiom in 2018. these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment's future performance also factor into the initial consideration. when actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees, businesses, assets or systems into our organization, including with respect to our internal policies and required controls. we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investment's operations. furthermore, it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all. talent is among our most valuable assets, and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel. acquisition and integration activity may also divert management's attention and other corporate resources from other business needs. if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition, or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. 11 table of contents we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks. we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, develop new business opportunities and digital products, and process business transactions. the incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, phishing attacks and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education. our business, which increasingly involves the collection, use and transmission of customer data, may make us and our agencies attractive targets for malicious third-party attempts to access this data. power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidential information. we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis, with a large number of agencies and legal entities, and the resulting size, diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns, malicious intrusions or attacks. likewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. we operate worldwide, and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex, conflicting, unclear or ever-changing. we also utilize third parties, including third-party cloud computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability, be expensive to remedy, result in a loss of our or our clients' or vendors' proprietary information and damage our reputation. efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and cyberattack techniques change frequently, or are not recognized until successful and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2019 , we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $4.9 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client's business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure . our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. agency operating cash flows have a significant impact on our liquidity, and we maintain a commercial paper program, a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit to increase flexibility in support of our operating needs. if any of these sources were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity and ability to adequately fund our operations could be adversely affected. furthermore, if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity, including in the capital markets, there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. under our commercial paper program, we are authorized to issue short-term debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1.5 billion, which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes. borrowings under the commercial 12 table of contents paper program are supported by our $1.5 billion committed corporate credit facility (the credit agreement ) . if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. the credit agreement contains a leverage ratio and other, non-financial, covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenant would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower revenues, including as a result of economic downturns, client losses or a substantial increase in client defaults. if we were unable to comply with any of the covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders, and our costs under these agreements could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated, any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration, and we could lose access to certain uncommitted financing arrangements and commercial paper. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations . in connection with the acxiom acquisition, we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt. on october 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of acxiom for approximately $2.3 billion, including customary closing adjustments. the indebtedness we incurred to fund the acxiom acquisition significantly increased our outstanding debt levels and will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt. as of december 31, 2019, $1.0 billion of this indebtedness matures within two years. if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our credit facilities or the debt securities we issued in connection with the acquisition, we may be required to refinance, restructure or otherwise amend some or all of our obligations, sell assets or raise additional cash through the sale of our common stock or convertible securities, and there could be a negative impact on our credit ratings. we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain refinancing on terms as favorable as our current financing or that any restructuring, sales of assets or issuances of equity can be accomplished or, if accomplished, would raise sufficient funds to meet our obligations. if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, that issuance could also result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates, we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors. our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient short-term debt ratings, and any downgrades to those ratings could increase our borrowing costs and reduce the market capacity for, or our ability to issue, commercial paper. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. the costs of compliance with sustainability or other social responsibility laws, regulations or policies, including client-driven policies and standards, could adversely affect our business. as a non location specific, non manufacturing service business we have to date been sheltered from or able to mitigate many direct impacts from climate change and related laws and regulations. we are, however, increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change and laws and regulations related to other sustainability concerns, and, we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients. increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility, sustainability or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us, and sustainability and governance issues are increasingly a focus of the investor community. our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation. if large shareholders were to reduce their ownership stakes in our company as a result of dissatisfaction with our policies or efforts in this area, there could be negative impact on our stock price, and we could also suffer reputational harm. further, if clients' costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations, this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services. we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate change-related costs and seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers. 13 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivative instruments, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations. the majority of our debt (approximately 97% and 86% as of december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates, and the impact of a 10% change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/(decrease) in fair market value as of december 31, 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2019 $ (61.3 ) $ 65.2 2018 (91.3 ) 82.5 we had $1,192.2 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2019 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term bank deposits or securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2019 and 2018 , we had interest income of $34.5 and $21.8 , respectively. based on our 2019 results, a 100 basis-point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $11.9 , assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2019 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31, 2019 were the british pound sterling and euro. based on 2019 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2019 levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, in the stockholders' equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and other direct expenses. we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use derivative financial instruments, designated as fair value hedges or net investment hedges, to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures. we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country is changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. 39 table of contents credit and market risks balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts receivable billable to clients. we invest our cash primarily in investment-grade, short-term securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year, which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 40 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 90 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. from time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. at december 31, 2004, a significant portion (81.1%) of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. accordingly, assuming the fixed-rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by approximately $16.3 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $19.5 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at december 31, 2004, interest expense and cash out-flow would increase or decrease by approximately $1.8 if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, respectively. from time to time we have used interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations. in may 2005, we terminated all our existing long-term interest rate swap agreements, and currently have none outstanding. foreign currencies we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the us dollar, mitigating transaction risk. since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of us dollars depending upon whether the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. therefore, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in us dollars) from foreign operations. currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the year ended december 31, 2004. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 90 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 90 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the

foreign currency exchange rates. 90 table of contentsrisk factors 5 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to the industry in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we have numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. we have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31, 2005. for a detailed description of these material weaknesses, see item 8, management assessment on internal control over financial reporting, of our form 10-k. each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected. as a result, we must perform extensive additional work to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements. given the extensive material weaknesses identified, even with this additional work there is a risk of errors not being prevented or detected, which could result in further restatements. 5 table of contents we have extensive work remaining to remedy the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. because of our decentralized structure and our many disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication, we have extensive work remaining to remedy our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. we are in the process of developing a work plan for remedying all of the identified material weaknesses, and this work will extend beyond 2006. there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be completed or when the material weaknesses will be remedied. there will also continue to be a serious risk that we will be unable to file future periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner, that a default could result under the indentures governing our debt securities or under our three-year revolving credit agreement (the three-year revolving credit facility ) or credit facilities of our subsidiaries and that our future financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. we face substantial ongoing costs associated with complying with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. as a result of the extent of the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, we incurred significant professional fees and other expenses in 2005 to prepare our consolidated financial statements and to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act. until our remediation is completed, we will continue to incur the expenses and management burdens associated with the manual procedures and additional resources required to prepare our consolidated financial statements. the cost of this work will continue to be significant in 2006 and beyond. we have restated our financial statements. we may continue to suffer adverse effects from the restatement of previously issued financial statements that we presented in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2004, as amended (the 2004 form 10-k ). in the 2004 form 10-k, we restated our previously reported financial statements for the years ended december 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and for the first three quarters of 2004 and all four quarters of 2003 (the prior restatement ). in this report, we have restated the financial data for the first three quarters of 2005. as a result of these matters, we have recorded liabilities for vendor discounts and other obligations that will necessitate cash settlement that may negatively impact our cash flow in future years. we may also become subject to fines or other penalties or damages in our ongoing sec investigation or new regulatory actions or civil litigation. any of these matters may also contribute to further ratings downgrades, negative publicity and difficulties in attracting and retaining key clients, employees and management personnel. ongoing sec investigations regarding our accounting restatements could adversely affect us. the sec opened a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in august 2002 and, as previously disclosed, the sec staff investigation has expanded to encompass our prior restatement. in particular, since we filed our 2004 form 10-k, we have received subpoenas from the sec relating to matters addressed in our prior restatement. we continue to cooperate with the investigation. we expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in particular with respect to the prior restatement, we cannot reasonably estimate either the timing of a resolution or the amount. accordingly, we have not yet established any accounting provision relating to these matters. potential adverse developments in connection with the investigation, including any expansion of the scope of the investigation, could also negatively impact us and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team from our ordinary business operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry. the marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative or media services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. the client perception of the quality of an agency creative work, our reputation and the agencies reputations are important factors in determining our 6 table of contents competitive position. an agency ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client account from a much larger competitor. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. in addition, issues arising from our deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could divert the efforts and attention of our management from our ordinary business operations or have an adverse impact on clients perceptions of us and adversely affect our overall ability to compete for new and existing business. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. employees, including creative, research, media, account and practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most important assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our recent financial performance and financial reporting difficulties. as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing services industry than other industries. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic performance in any region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. this pattern may recur in the future. our liquidity profile has recently been adversely affected. in recent periods we have experienced operating losses that have adversely affected our cash flows from operations. we have recorded liabilities and incurred substantial professional fees in connection with the prior restatement. it is also possible that we will be required to pay fines or other penalties or damages in connection with the ongoing sec investigation or future regulatory actions or civil litigation. these items have impacted and will impact our liquidity in future years negatively and could require us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs. there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any such new sources of new liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. if we are unable to do so, our liquidity position could be adversely affected. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. our long-term debt is currently rated b+ with negative outlook by standard and poor s, ba1 with negative outlook by moody s, and b+ with stable outlook by fitch. it is possible that our credit ratings will be reduced further. ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have a significant adverse affect on our liquidity. if some of our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. if any client with whom we have a substantial amount of business experiences financial difficulty, it could delay or jeopardize the 7 table of contents collection of accounts receivable, may result in significant reductions in services provided by us and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. for a description of our client base, see item 1, business- clients. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 45% in 2005. our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation, exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a high level of our revenues and expenses is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, primarily the euro and pound sterling, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. in 2005 and prior years, we recognized impairment charges and increased our deferred tax valuation allowances, and we may be required to record additional charges in the future related to these matters. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. in the past, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill, investment and other impairment charges, and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards. as of december 31, 2005, we have substantial amounts of intangibles, investments and deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet. future events, including our financial performance and strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with intangibles, investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired. any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. in connection with the u.s. deferred tax assets, management believes that it is more likely than not that a substantial amount of the deferred tax assets will be realized; a valuation allowance has been established for the remainder. the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future u.s. taxable income are lower than anticipated. we are subject to certain restrictions and must meet certain minimum financial covenants under our three-year revolving credit facility. our three-year revolving credit facility contains covenants that limit our operational flexibility and require us to meet specified financial ratios. the three-year revolving credit facility does not permit us (i) to make cash acquisitions in excess of $50.0 million until october 2006, or thereafter in excess of $50.0 million until expiration of the agreement in may 2007, subject to increases equal to the net cash proceeds received in the applicable period from any disposition of assets; (ii) to make capital expenditures in excess of $210.0 million annually; (iii) to repurchase or to declare or pay dividends on our capital stock (except for any convertible preferred stock, convertible trust preferred instrument or similar security, which includes our outstanding 5.375% series a mandatory convertible preferred stock and our 5.25% series b cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock), except that we may repurchase our capital stock in connection with the exercise of options by our employees or with proceeds contemporaneously received from an issue of new shares of our capital stock; and (iv) to incur new debt at our subsidiaries, other than unsecured debt incurred in the ordinary course of business of our subsidiaries outside the u.s. and unsecured debt, which may not exceed $10.0 million in the aggregate, incurred in the ordinary course of business of our u.s. subsidiaries. under the three-year revolving credit facility, we are also subject to financial covenants with respect to our interest coverage ratio, debt to ebitda ratio and minimum ebitda. we have in the past been required to seek and successfully have obtained amendments and waivers of the financial covenants under our committed bank facility. there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with these covenants in future periods. if we do not comply and are unable to obtain the necessary amendments or waivers at that time, we would be unable to borrow or obtain additional letters 8 table of contents of credit under the three-year revolving credit facility and could choose to terminate the facility and provide a cash deposit in connection with any outstanding letters of credit. the lenders under the three-year revolving credit facility would also have the right to terminate the facility, accelerate any outstanding principal and require us to provide a cash deposit in an amount equal to the total amount of outstanding letters of credit. the outstanding amount of letters of credit was $162.4 million as of december 31, 2005. we have not drawn under the three-year revolving credit facility over the past two years, and we do not currently expect to draw under it. so long as there are no amounts to be accelerated under the three-year revolving credit facility, termination of the facility would not trigger the cross-acceleration provisions of our public debt. any future impairment charge (excluding valuation allowance charges) could result in a violation of the financial covenants of our three-year revolving credit facility, which requires us to maintain minimum levels of consolidated ebitda (as defined in that facility) and established ratios of debt to consolidated ebitda and interest coverage ratios. a violation of any of these financial covenants could trigger a default under this facility and adversely affect our liquidity. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the market certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance including, but not limited to, the areas of revenue growth, operating expense reduction and operating margin growth. these targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance, but they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we are subject to regulations and other governmental scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. through the years, there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products. representatives within government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 83 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. from time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. as further described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, our principal debt obligations at december 31, 2005 consisted of our 4.50% notes and senior unsecured notes, with expiration dates ranging from 2009 to 2014. at december 31, 2005 and 2004, 86.0% and 81.1% of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. accordingly, assuming the fixed-rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. however, there would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt, as the fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. for 2005, the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by approximately $27.7 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $28.0 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. for 2004, the fair market value of the debt obligations would have decreased by approximately $16.3 if market rates increased by 10% and would have increased by approximately $19.5 if market rates decreased by 10%. for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at december 31, 2005, interest expense and cash out-flow would increase or decrease by approximately $2.1 if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, respectively. for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at december 31, 2004, interest expense and cash out-flow would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.8 if market rates increased or decreased by 10%, respectively. from time to time we have used interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations. in may 2005, we terminated all our existing long-term interest rate swap agreements, and currently have none outstanding. foreign currencies we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, mitigating transaction risk. since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into varying amounts of u.s. dollars depending upon whether the u.s. dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies. therefore, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 83 table of contentsrisk factors 7 , risk factors. forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: risks arising from material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, including material weaknesses in our control environment; our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients; our ability to retain and attract key employees; risks associated with assumptions we make in connection with our critical accounting estimates; potential adverse effects if we are required to recognize impairment charges or other adverse accounting-related developments; potential adverse developments in connection with the ongoing securities and exchange commission ( sec ) investigation; potential downgrades in the credit ratings of our securities; risks associated with the effects of global, national and regional economic and political conditions, including fluctuations in economic growth rates, interest rates and currency exchange rates; and developments from changes in the regulatory and legal environment for advertising and marketing and communications services companies around the world. investors should carefully

business the interpublic group of companies, inc. was incorporated in delaware in september 1930 under the name of mccann-erickson incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency businesses founded in 1902 by a.w. erickson and in 1911 by harrison k. mccann. the company has operated under the interpublic name since january 1961. about us the interpublic group of companies, inc., together with its subsidiaries (the company, interpublic, we, us or our ), is one of the world largest advertising and marketing services companies, comprised of communication agencies around the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our clients. these agencies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties, from traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct marketing, to emerging services such as mobile and search engine marketing. with hundreds of offices in over 100 countries and approximately 42,000 employees, our agencies develop marketing programs that build brands, influence consumer behavior and sell products. to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex consumer culture, we create customized marketing solutions for each of our clients. these solutions vary from project-based work between one agency and its client to long-term, fully-integrated campaigns involving several of our companies working on behalf of a client. furthermore, our agencies cover all major markets geographically and can operate in a single region or align work globally across many markets. the role of the holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet our clients needs. based in new york city, interpublic sets company-wide financial objectives and corporate strategy, directs collaborative inter-agency programs, establishes financial management and operational controls, guides personnel policy, conducts investor relations and initiates, manages and approves mergers and acquisitions. in addition, we provide limited centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies, including accounting and finance, marketing information retrieval and analysis, legal services, real estate expertise, travel services, recruitment aid, employee benefits and executive compensation management. our strategy we compete in a fast-changing industry. to keep pace with the trends transforming the media landscape, including new technologies, a proliferation of media channels and changes in consumer habits, we believe a marketing communications group must have a broad spectrum of innovative agency brands to help clients navigate a fragmented market. to keep our company well-positioned, we support our agencies initiatives to expand their high-growth capabilities and build their offerings in key developing markets. when appropriate, we also develop relationships with companies that are building leading-edge marketing tools that complement our agencies and the programs they are developing for clients. in addition, we look for opportunities within our company to modernize operations through mergers, strategic alliances and the development of internal programs that encourage intra-company collaboration. in 2006, we took a number of steps to lead our company forward strategically. these initiatives include merging two of our companies to form draftfcb, a modern, integrated global agency; a realignment of our media assets with our two largest global advertising networks to create a closer working relationship between the two disciplines; a newly focused lowe with hubs in eight key markets; and strategic digital investments both internally and externally. to manage the broadest range of clients, we continue to maintain separate agency brands in competing disciplines. having distinct agencies allows us to create custom solutions best suited to specific clients, as well as avoid potential conflicts of interest among clients in the same industry. our brands within interpublic, we have some of the world best known and most innovative communication specialists. 4 table of contents globally, we offer three distinct options for clients seeking large-scale, integrated capabilities across all our disciplines. these include draftfcb, lowe worldwide and mccann worldgroup. launched in 2006, draftfcb is a modern agency model for clients seeking creative and accountable marketing programs. with more than 130 years of combined expertise, the newly formed company has its roots in both consumer advertising and behavioral, data-driven direct marketing. the agency is the first global, behavior-based, highly creative and accountable marketing communications organization to operate with a single income statement. lowe worldwide is a premier creative agency that operates in the world largest advertising markets. lowe is focused on delivering and sustaining high-value ideas for some of the world largest clients. the quality of the agency product is evident in its global creative rankings and its standing in major markets, including the united kingdom, united states, india, sweden and much of latin america. by partnering with interpublic marketing services companies, lowe generates and executes ideas that are frequently recognized for effectiveness, amplified by smart communication channel planning. mccann worldgroup, one of the world leading marketing communications companies, offers best-in-class communications tools and resources to many of the world top companies and most famous brands. as more and more marketers seek additional ways to reach consumers, mccann worldgroup is exceptionally qualified to meet their demands, in all regions of the world and in all marketing disciplines, through its operating units: mccann erickson advertising, with operations in over 100 countries; mrm worldwide for relationship marketing and digital expertise; momentum worldwide for experiential marketing; and mccann healthcare worldwide for healthcare communications. within our group, we also have a unique roster of strong full-service domestic agency brands, including campbell-ewald, campbell mithun, deutsch, hill holliday, the martin agency and mullen. the integrated marketing programs created by this group have helped build some of the most powerful brands in the u.s., across all sectors and industries. interpublic also has two leading media specialists, initiative and universal mccann. to develop creative ideas that resonate with consumers, brand-building agencies must work closely with media agencies. initiative and universal mccann operate independently but were aligned with draftfcb and mccann erickson, respectively, in late 2006. this approach is intended to improve cross-media communications and our ability to deliver integrated marketing programs. our aligned model with respect to media differentiates us from our principal competitors. interpublic also has exceptional specialist firms across the full range of marketing services. these include futurebrand (corporate branding), jack morton (experiential marketing), octagon (sports marketing), regan campbell ward (healthcare communications), and webershandwick (public relations), all of which report into our constituency management group ( cmg ). we also have best-in-class digital agencies, led by r/ga. to further strengthen our emerging-media offering, in late 2006 we formed the futures marketing group, which houses existing high-growth media offerings such as the interpublic emerging media lab and fosters new media investments and alliances. many more of our marketing specialists can be found using the company finder tool on our website, www.interpublic.com. to help clients target fast-growth demographic segments in the u.s. market, interpublic owns a stake in several multicultural agencies, including abec (hispanic), accent marketing (hispanic), the axis agency (african american), casanova pendrill (hispanic), iw group (asian-pacific american) and siboneyusa (hispanic). our financial reporting segments for financial reporting purposes, we have two reportable segments: integrated agency network ( ian ), which is comprised of draftfcb, lowe, mccann, our media agencies and our leading stand-alone agencies, and cmg, which is comprised of the bulk of our specialist marketing service offerings. we also report results for the corporate and other group. until december 31, 2005, we had an additional segment, motorsports operations ( motorsports ), which was sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005. see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. principal markets our agencies are located in over 100 countries, including every significant world market. we provide services for clients whose businesses are broadly international in scope, as well as for clients whose businesses are limited to 5 table of contents a single country or a small number of countries. the united states ( u.s. ), europe (excluding the united kingdom ( u.k. )), the u.k., asia pacific and latin america represented 55.6%, 16.8%, 9.1%, 8.3% and 4.9% of our total revenue, respectively, in 2006. for further discussion concerning revenues and long-lived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. sources of revenue our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs. most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly, the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly. our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits. our largest clients are multinational entities and, as such, we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across various agencies. in arranging for such services to be provided, we may enter into global, regional and local agreements. revenues for creation, planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and, to a lesser extent, on a commission basis. fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a mark-up. many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package. this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreed-upon qualitative and/or quantitative metrics within specified time periods. commissions are earned based on services provided, and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment. commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate; the difference is the commission that we earn, which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement. we pay the media charges with respect to contracts for advertising time or space that we place on behalf of our clients. to reduce our risk from a client non-payment, we typically pay media charges only after we have received funds from our clients. generally, we act as the client agent rather than the primary obligor. in some instances we agree with the media provider that we will only be liable to pay the media after the client has paid us for the media charges. we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations, sales promotion, event marketing, sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services. our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the post-holiday slow-down in client activity. depending on the terms of the client contract, fees for services performed can be primarily recognized three ways: proportional performance, straight-line (or monthly basis) or completed contract. fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31. as is customary in the industry, our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 90 days. see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies. clients in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 25% of revenue in 2006 and 2005. based on revenue for the year ended december 31, 2006, our largest clients were general motors corporation, johnson johnson, microsoft, unilever and verizon. while the loss of the entire business of any one of our largest clients might have a material adverse effect upon our business, we believe that it is unlikely that the entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time. this is because we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets, as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines, in each case through more than one of our agency systems. representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations. any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to a competing agency, and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time. 6 table of contents personnel as of december 31, 2006, we employed approximately 42,000 persons, of whom approximately 18,000 were employed in the u.s. because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business, the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success. there is keen competition for qualified employees. item 1a. risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to the industry in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we have numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and extensive work remaining to remediate these weaknesses. we have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31, 2006. for a detailed description of these material weaknesses, see item 8, management assessment of internal control over financial reporting, in this report. each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected. given the extensive material weaknesses identified, there is a risk of errors not being prevented or detected, which could require us to restate our financial statements in the future. any such restatements could result in or contribute to regulatory actions or civil litigation, ratings downgrades, negative publicity or difficulties in attracting or retaining key clients, employees and management personnel. we incurred significant professional fees and other expenses in 2006 to prepare our consolidated financial statements and to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002, in particular as a result of the extent of the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and the extensive additional work and resources required to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements. the cost of this work will continue to be significant in 2007 and beyond. because of our decentralized structure and our many disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication, we have extensive work remaining to remediate our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. we have developed a work plan with the goal of remediating all of the identified material weaknesses by the time we file our annual report on form 10-k for the year ending december 31, 2007. there can be no assurance, however, as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented and all the material weaknesses remediated. until our remediation is completed, there will also continue to be a risk that we will be unable to file future periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner and that a default could result under the indentures governing our debt securities, under any of our credit facilities or under any credit facilities of our subsidiaries. ongoing sec investigations regarding our accounting restatements could adversely affect us. the sec opened a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in august 2002 and the investigation expanded to encompass the restatement we presented in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2004 that we filed in september 2005 (the 2005 restatement ). in particular, since we filed our 2004 annual report on form 10-k, we have received subpoenas from the sec relating to matters addressed in our 2005 restatement. we have also responded to inquiries from the sec staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 annual report on form 10-k. we continue to cooperate with the investigation. we expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability, but because the investigation is ongoing, in particular with respect to the 2005 restatement, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a resolution. accordingly, we have not yet established any accounting provision relating to these matters. adverse developments in connection with the investigation, including any expansion of the scope of the investigation, could also negatively impact us and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team from our ordinary business operations. we operate in a highly competitive industry. 7 table of contents the marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative or media services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. the client perception of the quality of an agency creative work, our reputation and the agencies reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position. an agency ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client account from a much larger competitor. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. employees, including creative, research, media, account and practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most important assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our recent financial or market performance. as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing services industry than other industries. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic performance in any region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. this pattern may recur in the future. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. our long-term debt is currently rated ba3 with negative outlook by moody s, b creditwatch negative by standard and poor s, and b with negative outlook by fitch. it is possible that our credit ratings will be reduced further. ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity. our liquidity profile could be adversely affected. in previous years, we have experienced operating losses and weak operating cash flow. until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround, cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods. this could have a negative impact on our liquidity in future years and could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs. there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. if we were unable to do so, our liquidity position could be adversely affected. if some of our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. if any client with whom we have a substantial amount of business experiences financial difficulty, it could delay or jeopardize the collection of accounts receivable, may result in significant reductions in services provided by us and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. for a description of our client base, see item 1, business clients. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. 8 table of contents international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 44% in 2006. our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation, exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the euro, pound sterling, canadian dollar, brazilian real, japanese yen and south african rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. in 2006 and prior years, we recognized impairment charges and increased our deferred tax valuation allowances, and we may be required to record additional charges in the future related to these matters. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. in the past, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill, investment and other impairment charges, and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards. as of december 31, 2006, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet. future events, including our financial performance and strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired. any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the market certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance including, but not limited to, the areas of revenue growth, operating expense reduction and operating margin growth. these targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance, but they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we are subject to regulations and other governmental scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. through the years, there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products. representatives within government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. from time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. as of december 31, 2006 and 2005, 85.1% and 86.0% of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates. accordingly, assuming the fixed-rate debt is not refinanced, there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10% increase or decrease in market rates of interest. however, there would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt, as the fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. for 2006, the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by $28.8 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by $29.5 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. for 2005, the fair market value of the debt obligations would have decreased by $27.7 if market rates increased by 10% and would have increased by $28.0 if market rates decreased by 10%. for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at december 31, 2006, interest expense and cash out-flow would increase or decrease by $2.3 if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, respectively. for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates at december 31, 2005, interest expense and cash out-flow would have increased or decreased by $2.1 if market rates increased or decreased by 10%, respectively. interest rate swaps have been used to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations. in may 2005, we terminated all our existing long-term interest rate swap agreements, and currently have none outstanding. foreign currencies we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, mitigating transaction risk. since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 39 table of contentsrisk factors 8 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to the industry in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also impair our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. ongoing sec investigations regarding our accounting restatements could adversely affect us. since january 2003 the sec has been conducting a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in august 2002, and in 2005 the investigation expanded to encompass the restatement we presented in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2004 that we filed in september 2005. we have also responded to inquiries from the sec staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 annual report on form 10-k. we continue to cooperate with the investigation. we expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability, but as settlement discussions have not yet commenced, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount, range of amounts or timing of a resolution. accordingly, we have not yet established any provision relating to these matters. the sec staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval from the commission to enter into settlement discussions with us or, failing a settlement, to litigate an action charging the company with various violations of the federal securities laws. in that connection, and as previously disclosed in our current report on form 8-k filed june 14, 2007, the staff sent us a wells notice, which invited us to make a responsive submission before the staff makes a final determination concerning its recommendation to the commission. we expect to discuss settlement with the staff once the commission authorizes the staff to engage in such discussions. we cannot at this time predict what the commission will authorize or the outcome of any settlement negotiations. we operate in a highly competitive industry. the marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative or media services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets. new market participants include systems integrators, database marketing and modeling companies, telemarketers and internet companies. the client perception of the quality of an agency creative work, our reputation and the agencies reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position. an agency ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client account from a much larger competitor. 8 table of contents many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26% of revenue in 2007. while we believe it unlikely that we would lose the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the same time, a substantial decline in such a client advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of its entire business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. employees, including creative, research, media, account and practice group specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most important assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our recent financial or market performance. as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing services industry than other industries. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic performance in any region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. this pattern may recur in the future. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. our long-term debt is currently rated ba3 with stable outlook by moody s, b with positive outlook by standard and poor s, and bb- with stable outlook by fitch. any ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. our liquidity profile could be adversely affected. in previous years, we have experienced operating losses and weak operating cash flow. until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround, cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods. this could have a negative impact on our liquidity in future years and could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs. there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. if we were unable to do so, our liquidity position could be adversely affected. if some of our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial distress, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. if any client with whom we have a substantial amount of business experiences financial difficulty, it could delay or jeopardize the collection of accounts receivable, may result in significant reductions in services provided by us and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. for a description of our client base, see item 1, business clients. 9 table of contents international business risks could adversely affect our operations. international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 44% in 2007. our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation, exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the euro, pound sterling, canadian dollar, brazilian real, japanese yen and south african rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. in 2006 and prior years, we recognized impairment charges and increased our deferred tax valuation allowances, and we may be required to record additional charges in the future related to these matters. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. in the past, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill, investment and other impairment charges, and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards. as of december 31, 2007, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet. future events, including our financial performance and strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired. any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance including, but not limited to, the areas of revenue and operating margin growth. these targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance, but they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we are subject to regulations and other governmental scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. through the years, there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products. representatives within government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates. from time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. as

debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates. for 2007, the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by $18.4 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by $19.4 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. for 2006, the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by $28.8 if market rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by $29.5 if market rates were to decrease by 10%. for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates, based on outstanding amounts and rates as of december 31, 2007 and 2006, net interest expense and cash out-flow would increase or decrease by approximately $2.0 in each year if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10%. interest rate swaps have been used to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations. however, we currently have none outstanding. foreign currencies we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, mitigating transaction risk. since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency, foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders equity and does not impact operating results. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the years ended december 31, 2007 and 2006. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. derivatives the terms of the 4.50% notes include two embedded derivative instruments and the terms of our 4.75% notes, 4.25% notes and our series b preferred stock each include one embedded derivative instrument. the fair value of these derivatives on december 31, 2007 was negligible. in addition, we have entered into operating leases in a foreign country with payments that are payable in the u.s. dollar or its equivalent dollar value in that country currency and future rent increases are based on the u.s. inflation rate according to the consumer price index. as such, these leases contain an embedded foreign currency derivative and we have recorded a long-term asset on our consolidated balance sheets. the changes in value of this asset, which are negligible, have been recorded as other income or expense in our consolidated statements of operations. 40risk factors 6 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions of the industry in which we operate, while others are more specific to us. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also impair our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we operate in a highly competitive industry. the marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative or media services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets. new market participants include systems integrators, database marketing and modeling companies, telemarketers and internet companies. the client perception of the quality of an agency creative work, our reputation and the agencies reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position. an agency ability to serve clients, 6 table of contents particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client account from a much larger competitor. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26% of revenue in 2008. while we believe it unlikely that we would lose the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the same time due to competitive considerations, a substantial decline in a large client advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of its entire business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely impact our financial condition and results. economic and financial conditions deteriorated sharply in the latter part of 2008, and the deterioration is persisting in 2009. the effects could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. a) as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. economic downturns could affect the marketing services industry more severely than other industries, and the recovery of the marketing services industry could lag that of the economy generally. in the past, some clients have responded to weakening economic conditions with reductions to their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations. b) if our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. the current unfavorable economic and financial conditions that are impacting most sectors of the economy could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of goodwill, credit facility covenant violations or reduced liquidity. our largest single client accounted for approximately 5% of revenue in 2008 and approximately 4% of accounts receivable at december 31, 2008. for a description of our client base, see item 1, business clients. c) our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain committed credit facilities to increase our financial flexibility. the $335 million credit facility we entered into in july 2008 includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions, and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution commitment, the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced. furthermore, that agreement contains financial covenants, and the current economic difficulties could adversely affect our ability to comply with them, for example, if we experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were to fail to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in that agreement, we could 7 table of contents be required to seek an amendment or waiver, and our costs under the agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the agreement could be terminated. the $750 million credit facility we entered into in june 2006 expires in june 2009, and we do not plan on replacing the full amount of that facility. if credit under our credit facilities were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. if our business is significantly adversely affected by further deterioration in the economic environment or otherwise, it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our needs. currently, for a non-investment-grade company such as ours, the capital markets are challenging, with limited available financing and at higher costs than in recent years. there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. in 2006 and prior years, we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill, investment and other impairment charges, and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carry-forwards. as of december 31, 2008, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.2 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or comparable companies, loss of a significant client business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired. we discuss our policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets, and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, below under critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7. any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most important assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our financial or market performance. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. our long-term debt is currently rated ba3 with positive outlook by moody s, b+ with positive outlook by standard and poor s, and bb+ with positive outlook by fitch. any ratings downgrades or ratings weaker than those of our competitors can adversely affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any 8 table of contents target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 45% in 2008. our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation, exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the euro, pound sterling, brazilian real, japanese yen, canadian dollar and south african rand, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. we are subject to regulations and other governmental scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. through the years, there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products. representatives within government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations as the majority of our debt (approximately 84% as of december 31, 2008) bore interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and for 2008 this fair market value would decrease by approximately $22.0 if interest rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $23.0 if interest rates were to decrease by 10%. for 2007, the fair market value of our debt would decrease by approximately $18.0 if interest rates were to increase by 10% and would increase by approximately $19.0 if interest rates were to decrease by 10%. we have used interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and variable rate debt obligations, but currently have none outstanding as we terminated our interest rate swap agreement on the 7.25% senior unsecured notes in september 2008. foreign currencies we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. based on 2008 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease between 3% and 5%. this assumes that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant from current levels. as the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency, our foreign operations are translated into u.s. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period presented for revenues and expenses. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. credit and market risks certain balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our excess cash in investment-grade, short-term securities with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographical areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. 39 table of contents as of december 31, 2008, we held $12.5 in par value of asset-backed auction rate securities. with the liquidity issues experienced in the credit and capital markets worldwide, the auctions have failed due to insufficient bids from buyers and as a result we adjusted these securities to a new book value of $6.7 during 2007. we believe we have the ability and currently intend to hold our auction rate securities until we can recover the full principal. we do not believe that the lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our ability to operate our business. for additional information, see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. as a result of the market decline in 2008, the fair value of our pension plan assets have declined by approximately 12% (excluding foreign currency impacts), resulting in higher pension expense and funding requirements in 2009, and, if unchanged, could result in higher pension expense and funding requirements in periods beyond 2009. 40 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also impair our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we operate in a highly competitive industry. the marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative or media services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities

agencies creative work, our reputation and our agencies reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position. an agency ability to serve clients, particularly large international

unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client account from a much larger competitor. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 24% of revenue in 2009. while we believe it unlikely that we would 6 table of contents lose the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the same time due to competitive considerations, a substantial decline in a large client advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of its entire business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. continuing difficult economic and financial conditions could adversely impact our financial condition and results. the global economic recession made business conditions extremely challenging for us during 2009. the weak conditions in the broader economy continue to affect the demand for advertising and marketing services and present a challenge to the revenue and profit growth of our company. a) as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. the economic downturn has severely affected the marketing services industry, and the recovery of the marketing services industry could lag that of the economy generally. many clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions with reductions to their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may continue or recur in the future. a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations. b) if our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions like those that have impacted most sectors of the economy could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. for a description of our client base, see clients in item 1, business. c) our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility. the $335.0 million three-year credit agreement (the 2008 credit agreement ) we entered into in july 2008 includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions, and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution commitment, the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced. furthermore, the 2008 credit agreement contains financial covenants, and continued economic difficulties could adversely affect our ability to comply with them, for example, if we experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. in 2009 and in january 2010, we obtained amendments to the 2008 credit agreement in order to retain our ability to comply with those covenants. if in the future we were to conclude that we would be unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the 2008 credit agreement, we could be required to seek further amendments or waivers, and our costs under the 2008 credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the 2008 credit agreement could be terminated. if credit under our credit facilities were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. if our business is significantly adversely affected by the difficult economic environment or otherwise, it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our needs. currently, for a non-investment-grade company like ours, the capital markets remain challenging. there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. 7 table of contents our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. in prior years, we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill, investment and other impairment charges, and we have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets. as of december 31, 2009, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.3 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most important assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our financial or market performance. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. as of february 16, 2010 our long-term debt is rated ba3 with positive outlook by moody investor service, b+ with stable outlook by standard and poor s, and bb+ with positive outlook by fitch ratings. any ratings downgrades or ratings weaker than those of our competitors can adversely affect us, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 44% in 2009. our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds, including local legislation, monetary devaluation, exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the euro, pound sterling, brazilian real, japanese yen, canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. 8 table of contents we are subject to regulations and other governmental scrutiny that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our revenues. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, the courts or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. through the years, there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products. representatives within government bodies, both domestic and foreign, continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, our revenues. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (amounts in millions) in the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates, foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items. from time to time, we use derivatives, pursuant to established guidelines and policies, to manage some portion of these risks. derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations as the majority of our debt (approximately 84% as of december 31, 2009 and 2008) bears interest at fixed rates. we do have debt with variable interest rates, but a 10% increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows. the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a change in interest rates is summarized below. increase/(decrease) in fair market value 10% increase in interest rates 10% decrease in interest rates 2009 $ (36.0 ) $ 33.0 2008 (22.0 ) 23.0 we enter into interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. changes in interest rates could affect the amount recorded to our consolidated financial statements related to interest rate swap agreements. in the third quarter of 2009, we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $250.0 notional amount of our $350.0 2014 notes from fixed rate to floating rate debt. we recognize changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements as well as changes in fair value of the underlying debt within other income, net and as a result we recorded a net gain of $0.1 for the year ended december 31, 2009. in february 2010 we terminated all of our interest rate swaps. see note 2 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. we have $2,506.1 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2009, which are subject to changes in interest rates, and we generally invest these assets in conservative, short-term investment-grade securities with financial institutions. the interest income we obtain from these investments are subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2009, due to significant declines in foreign interest rates, and to a lesser extent, domestic interest rates, our interest income decreased when compared to 2008. a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would impact our interest income by approximately $25.0. this assumes that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end levels. foreign currencies we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary currency exchanges that we have exposure to in 2009 are the euro, pound sterling, brazilian real, japanese yen, canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi. based on 2009 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease between 1% and 3%. this assumes that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant from current levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented. the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets. our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay 36 table of contents expenses in their functional currency, mitigating transaction risk. however, certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency. assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement. currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses. we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment. a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100% or more over a three-year period. if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency, the u.s. dollar, and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary. our venezuela agencies will transition to inflationary accounting on january 1, 2010, and we will be recording a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the significant devaluation that occurred to the official rate in january 2010. this will be recorded in income before income taxes within the consolidated statement of operations. going forward, we will be re-measuring our local non-monetary transactions, assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 4.3 venezuelan bolivars fuertes per u.s. dollar. although this devaluation will result in a reduction in the u.s. dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses, we do not have significant operations in venezuela and, subsequent to our foreign exchange translation loss on devaluation noted above, we do not expect this to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. credit and market risks certain balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients. we invest our excess cash in investment-grade, short-term securities with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty. concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable. our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk. the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year and can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods. 37 table of contentsrisk factors 6 risk factors we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues, results of operations or financial condition. some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions, while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate. the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us. the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition. see also statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. we operate in a highly competitive industry. the marketing communications business is highly competitive. our agencies and media services compete with other agencies, and with other providers of creative, marketing or media services, to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business. our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies, but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets. new market participants include database marketing and modeling companies, telemarketers and internet companies. the client perception of the quality of our agencies creative work, our reputation and our agencies reputations are important factors that affect our competitive position. an agency ability to serve clients, particularly large international clients, on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration. on the other hand, because an agency principal asset is its people, freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is, on occasion, able to take all or some portion of a client account from a much larger competitor. many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time. we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions. in the aggregate, our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 24% of revenue in 2010. a substantial decline in a large client advertising and marketing spending, or the loss of a significant part of its business, could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also, in some cases, be limited by clients policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest. these policies can, in some cases, prevent one agency, or even different agencies under our ownership, from performing similar services for competing products or companies. 6 table of contents as a marketing services company, our revenues are highly susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. while we have seen economic recovery in many of our key markets in 2010, areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services. the marketing services industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downtown and can recover more slowly than the economy generally. in the past, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. this pattern may recur in the future. a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations. we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our employees, including creative, digital, research, media and account specialists, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel. our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors, including the compensation we award, and could be adversely affected by our financial or market performance. in addition, the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility. if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. if our clients experience financial distress, their weakened financial position could negatively affect our own financial position and results. we have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and if these effects were severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity. for a description of our client base, see clients in item 1, business. our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient. we maintain a committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility (as amended and restated as of april 23, 2010, the credit agreement ). the credit agreement contains financial covenants, and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them. for example, compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues, a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges. if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement, we could be required to seek further amendments or waivers, and our costs under the credit agreement could increase. if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver, the credit agreement could be terminated. furthermore, the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions, and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution commitment, the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced. if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient, our liquidity could be adversely affected. if our business is significantly adversely affected by difficult economic conditions, adverse conditions in the credit markets, unavailability of credit or otherwise, it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our needs. there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all. for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook, see liquidity and capital resources in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones. from time to time, we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance. they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance. our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent 7 table of contents risks and uncertainties, and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them. similarly, we may not realize the intended advantages of past or future investments or acquisitions of businesses because we may incorrectly evaluate risks and benefits from these transactions, or have unforeseen difficulties integrating them into our organization. see statement regarding forward-looking disclosure. our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances. we evaluate all of our long-lived assets (including goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets), investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable. if certain criteria are met, we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance. as of december 31, 2010, we have substantial amounts of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, including approximately $3.4 billion of goodwill. future events, including our financial performance, market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies, loss of a significant client business or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired. for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets, and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets, see critical accounting estimates in part ii, item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized. international business risks could adversely affect our operations. we are a global business. operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues, approximately 43% in 2010. these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation, currency variation, exchange control restrictions, and difficult local political or economic conditions. in developing countries or regions, we may face further risks, such as slower receipt of payments, nationalization, social and economic instability, currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws. these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries. in addition, because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar, such as the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar, chinese yuan renminbi, euro, japanese yen and pound sterling, fluctuations in exchange rates between the u.s. dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results. downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us. we can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors, because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. we are subject to regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or our financial condition. our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action, both domestic and foreign. advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation, regulation, judicial actions or otherwise, for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare. our business is also subject to specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products. legislators, agencies and other governmental units may continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products, such as alcohol or tobacco, and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising, which, if successful, may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and, consequently, on our revenues. furthermore, we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking controversial work that may be challenged by consumer groups. 8 table of contents quantitative and qualitative

have any outstanding as of december 31, 2010. we had $2,689.4 of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31, 2010 that we generally invest in conservative, short-term investment-grade securities. the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements. during 2010 and 2009, we had interest income of $28.7 and $35.0, respectively. based on our 2010 results, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately $27.0, assuming that all cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were affected in the same manner and balances remain constant from year-end 2010 levels. foreign currency rates we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. since we report revenues and expenses in u.s. dollars, changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses (as expressed in u.s. dollars) from foreign operations. the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2010 were the australian dollar, brazilian real, canadian dollar and euro. based on 2010 exchange rates and operating results, if the u.s. dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10%, we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3% and 5%, assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2010 current levels. the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency. assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at the average

foreign exchange translation loss of approximately $5.0 in the first quarter of 2010. this charge was recorded in office and general expenses within the consolidated statement of operations. we have re-measured our local non-monetary transactions, assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 4.3 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per u.s. dollar. subsequent to the currency re-measurement, this
