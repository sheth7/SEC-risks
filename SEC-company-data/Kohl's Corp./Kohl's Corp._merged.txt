risk factors 6 risk factors forward-looking statements this form 10-k contains forward-looking statements made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. words such as believes, anticipates, plans, may, intends, will, should, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. in addition, statements covering our future sales or financial performance and our plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions are forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store openings, adequacy of capital resources and reserves and statements contained in the "2013 outlook" section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligations to update them. our sales and gross margin could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those described below. many of these risk factors are outside of our control. if we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin and/or operating results. declines in general economic conditions, consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. in addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers' disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. recent economic conditions have caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy and declining consumer and business confidence, which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items. a continued or incremental slowdown in the u.s. economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. actions by our competitors. the retail business is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors, some of which have a greater market presence than kohl's, include traditional store-based retailers, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect our performance. our inability to offer merchandise our customers want and failure to successfully manage our inventory levels. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. approximately 30% of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third-party purchasing agent. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws and our required terms of engagement. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult with respect to goods sourced outside the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. 6 table of contents if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods. we could again experience inflation in our merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor costs as we did during 2011. the cost of cotton, which is a key raw material in many of our products, had the most dramatic increase in 2011. the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and government policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, such as cotton, could again affect our cost of goods and an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our profitability; while any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. ineffective marketing. we believe that differentiating kohl's in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands, which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty, increase the number of customers that shop our stores and website and increase our sales. if our marketing programs are not successful, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. damage to the reputation of the kohl's brand or our private and exclusive brands. we believe the kohl's brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition. in some cases, the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of our brand names or any affiliated individuals, could arise from product failures, litigation or various forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets, and may generate negative customer sentiment, potentially resulting in a reduction in sales, earnings, and shareholder value. product safety concerns. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns, could have a negative impact on our sales. disruptions in our information systems. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls.com website. the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability. weather conditions could adversely affect consumer shopping patterns. because a significant portion of our business is apparel and subject to weather conditions in our markets, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and hurricanes; or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns, diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise and/or causing physical damage to our properties. inability to successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers. omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving as our customers become increasingly technologically savvy. computers, mobile phones, tablets and other similar devices are progressively becoming a more important aspect of the shopping experience. additionally, the internet and other new technologies facilitate competitive entry and comparison shopping. we strive to offer an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and use social media as a way to interact with our customers and enhance their shopping experiences. if we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer- 7 table of contents facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customer expectations may suffer. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our revenues, operating results and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. this seasonality causes our operating results and cash needs to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. growth in our e-commerce business could adversely affect some of our operating metrics. in recent years, we have experienced significant growth in our e-commerce business. some of this growth has resulted in lower sales in our stores. though this has no impact on our consolidated sales, it has had a negative effect on our net income as a percentage of sales as our stores are currently more profitable than our e-commerce business. this profitability variance is due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, a higher mix of lower margin merchandise in our e-commerce business, shipping costs, and investments to provide the infrastructure necessary to grow the e-commerce business. though we are aggressively working to improve the profitability of our e-commerce business, there can be no assurances that our e-commerce business will become as profitable as our stores. our inability to raise additional capital and maintain bank credit on favorable terms could adversely affect our business and financial condition. we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital to partially fund our operations and growth. we have also historically maintained lines of credit with financial institutions. changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. if our credit rating were lowered, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. additionally, if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). if our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and/or shareholder value. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate merchandise sales and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl's credit card accounts have been sold to an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue if interest rates exceed defined amounts. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. an inability to attract and retain quality employees could result in higher payroll costs and adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality associates. many of those associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance. 8 table of contents regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. the costs and other effects of new or changed legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services, reduce the availability of raw materials or further restrict our ability to extend credit to our customers. we continually monitor the state and federal legal/regulatory environment for developments that may impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and/or loss of employee morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer, employee and company information. the protection of this data is extremely important to us, our employees and our customers. despite the considerable security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2012 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. cash equivalents and long-term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. during 2012 , average investments were $900 million and average yield was 0.3%. if interest rates on the average 2012 variable rate cash equivalents and long-term investments increased by 100 basis points, our annual interest income would also increase by approximately $9 million assuming comparable investment levels. we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the kohl's credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables if interest rates were to exceed defined rates. as a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. the reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance, and can not be reasonably estimated at this time.risk factors 5 risk factors forward-looking statements this form 10-k contains forward-looking

our merchandise is sourced by our vendors and by us from outside of the united states. we require all suppliers to comply with our terms of engagement for kohl's business partners and all applicable local and national laws, rules and regulations pertaining to all aspects of factory operations in the jurisdictions they conduct business. from time to time, suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more suppliers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results of

to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements including, among others, those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update them. our sales, gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those described below. many of these risk factors are outside of our control. if we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin and/or operating results. declines in general economic conditions, consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and fuel costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions, and the consumer's disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. the moderate income consumer, which is our core customer, has been under economic pressure for several years. recent economic conditions have caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy and declining consumer and business confidence, which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items. a continued or incremental slowdown in the u.s. economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. actions by our competitors. the retail business is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors include traditional department stores, upscale mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce. we consider style, quality and price to be the most significant competitive factors in our industry. the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to on-line and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers especially as it relates to national brands. in particular, consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors may adversely affect our performance. our inability to offer merchandise that resonates with existing customers and helps to attract new customers and failure to successfully manage our inventory levels. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships 6 table of contents with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. approximately 30% of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third-party purchasing agent. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, work stoppages, port strikes, and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods. the price and availability of raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and government policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our profitability. any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, a decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. failure of our vendors to adhere to our terms of engagement and applicable laws. a substantial portion of our merchandise is received from vendors and factories outside of the united states. we require all of our suppliers to comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations and our terms of engagement for kohl's business partners. our terms of engagement include employment and ethical standards as well as environmental, legal, communication, monitoring/compliance and other requirements. from time to time, suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more suppliers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results of operations. ineffective marketing. we believe that differentiating kohl's in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands and to build personalized connections with our customers. we believe our marketing programs will strengthen customer loyalty, increase the number and frequency of customers that shop our stores and website and increase our sales. if our marketing programs are not successful, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. damage to the reputation of the kohl's brand or our private and exclusive brands. we believe the kohl's brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools. we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition. in some cases, the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of the kohl's brand, our private and exclusive brand names or any affiliated individuals, could arise from product failures; concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions where merchandise is produced; perceptions of our pricing and return policies; litigation; vendor violations of our terms of engagement; or various other forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets. damage to our reputation may generate negative customer sentiment, potentially resulting in a reduction in sales, earnings, and shareholder value. product safety concerns. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or 7 table of contents private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns, could have a negative impact on our sales. disruptions in our information systems or an inability to adequately maintain and update those systems. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, and merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls.com website. we frequently make investments that will help maintain and update our existing information systems. the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives or the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability. weather conditions could adversely affect consumer shopping patterns. a significant portion of our business is apparel and is subject to weather conditions. as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and hurricanes; or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns, diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise and/or causing physical damage to our properties. inability to successfully execute a profitable omni-channel strategy. our business has evolved from an in-store only shopping experience to a multi-channel experience which includes in-store, on-line, mobile, social media and/or other interactions. we strive to offer a desirable omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and use social media as a way to interact with our customers and enhance their shopping experiences. our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to execute a relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner. our ability to compete may also suffer if kohl's, our suppliers, or our third-party shipping and delivery vendors are unable to effectively and efficiently fulfill and deliver orders, especially during the holiday season when sales volumes are especially high. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our omni-channel business currently generates a lower operating margin than we have historically reported when we were primarily a store-only retailer. this profitability variance is due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, an increase in the volume of lower margin merchandise, especially home products; costs to ship merchandise to our customers; and investments to provide the infrastructure necessary to expand our omni-channel strategy. there can be no assurances that future profitability will return to historical levels. our revenues, operating results and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. if we do not properly stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we may fail to meet customer demand, which could affect our revenue and our future growth. if we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. we may experience an increase in costs associated with shipping on-line orders due to complimentary upgrades, split shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. if too many customers access our website within a short period of time due to increased holiday demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. also, third-party delivery, direct ship vendors and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. this seasonality causes our operating results and cash needs to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. additionally, any decrease in sales or profitability during the second half of the fiscal year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations. 8 table of contents our inability to raise additional capital and maintain bank credit on favorable terms could adversely affect our business and financial condition. we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital to partially fund our operations and growth. we have also historically maintained lines of credit with financial institutions. changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. if our credit ratings fall below desirable levels, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. additionally, if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). if our access to capital was to become significantly constrained or our cost of capital was to increase significantly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and/or shareholder value. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate merchandise sales and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl's credit card accounts are owned by an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue if interest rates exceed defined amounts. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. an inability to attract and retain quality associates could result in higher payroll costs and adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality associates. many of those associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. many of our strategic initiatives require that we hire and/or develop associates with appropriate experience. our staffing needs are especially high during the holiday season. competition for these associates is intense. we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, actions by our competitors in compensation levels and changing demographics. changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance. in addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefit costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. the costs and other effects of new or changed legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services, reduce the availability of raw materials or further restrict our ability to extend credit to our customers. we continually monitor the state and federal legal/regulatory environment for developments that may impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and/or loss of associate morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise out of the conduct of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. 9 table of contents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer, associate or company information could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer, associate and company information. the protection of this data is extremely important to us, our associates and our customers. despite the considerable security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2014 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the kohl's credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables if interest rates were to exceed defined rates. as a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. the reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance, and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.risk factors 5 risk factors forward-looking statements this form 10-k contains forward-looking statements made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "may," "intends,"

factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update them. our sales, gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those described below. many of these risk factors are outside of our control. if we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin and/or operating results. declines in general economic conditions, consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and fuel costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions, and the consumer's disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. the moderate income consumer, which is our core customer, is especially sensitive to these factors. a continued or incremental slowdown in the u.s. economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. actions by our competitors. the retail industry is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors include traditional department stores, upscale mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce. we consider style, quality and price to be the

compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors include traditional department stores, upscale mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce. we consider style, quality and price to be the most significant competitive factors in our industry. the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to on-line and mobile channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers especially as it relates to national brands. in particular, consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors may adversely affect our performance. 5 table of contents changes in tax and trade policies. uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries has recently increased. we source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside of the united states, primarily in asia. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise and certain interest expense and the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. operational risks our inability to offer merchandise that resonates with existing customers and helps to attract new customers and failure to successfully manage our inventory levels. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. approximately 30% of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third-party purchasing agent. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the united states, substantially all of which is shipped by ocean to ports in the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, work stoppages, port strikes, port congestion and delays and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of merchandise sold. the price and availability of raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and government policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our profitability. any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, a decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. failure of our vendors to adhere to our terms of engagement and applicable laws. a substantial portion of our merchandise is received from vendors and factories outside of the united states. we require all of our suppliers to comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations and our terms of engagement for kohl's business partners. these terms of engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations, employment practices, ethical standards, environmental and legal requirements, communication, monitoring/compliance, record keeping, subcontracting and corrective action. from time to time, suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more suppliers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results of operations. 6 table of contents ineffective marketing. we believe that differentiating kohl's in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing and loyalty programs to increase awareness of our brands and to build personalized connections with our customers. we believe these programs will strengthen customer loyalty, increase the number and frequency of customers that shop our stores and website and increase our sales. if our marketing and loyalty programs are not successful, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected. damage to the reputation of the kohl's brand or our private and exclusive brands. we believe the kohl's brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools. we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition. in some cases, the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of the kohl's brand, our private and exclusive brand names or any affiliated individuals, could arise from product failures; concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions where merchandise is produced; perceptions of our pricing and return policies; litigation; vendor violations of our terms of engagement; or various other forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets. damage to our reputation may generate negative customer sentiment, potentially resulting in a reduction in sales, earnings, and shareholder value. product safety concerns. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns, could have a negative impact on our sales and operating results. disruptions in our information systems or an inability to adequately maintain and update those systems. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, and merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls.com website. we frequently make investments that will help maintain and update our existing information systems. the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives or the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability. weather conditions could adversely affect consumer shopping patterns. a significant portion of our business is apparel and is subject to weather conditions. as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and hurricanes; or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns, diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise and/or causing physical damage to our properties. inability to successfully execute a profitable omni-channel strategy. our business has evolved from an in-store only shopping experience to an omni-channel experience which includes in-store, on-line, mobile, social media and/or other interactions. we strive to offer a desirable omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and use social media as a way to interact with our customers and enhance their shopping experiences. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are also evolving. customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology. our ability to compete may also suffer if kohl's, our suppliers, or our third-party shipping and delivery vendors are unable to effectively and efficiently fulfill and deliver orders, especially during the 7 table of contents holiday season when sales volumes are especially high. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our omni-channel business currently generates a lower operating margin than we have historically reported when we were primarily a store-only retailer. this profitability variance is due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, an increase in the volume of lower margin merchandise, especially home products; costs to ship merchandise to our customers; and investments to provide the infrastructure necessary to expand our omni-channel strategy. there has been rapid growth in penetration of these less profitable omni-channel sales. there can be no assurances that future profitability will return to historical levels. our revenues, operating results and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. if we do not properly stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we may fail to meet customer demand, which could affect our revenue and our future growth. if we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. we may experience an increase in costs associated with shipping on-line orders due to complimentary upgrades, split shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. if too many customers access our website within a short period of time, we may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. also, third-party delivery and direct ship vendors may be unable to deliver merchandise on a timely basis. this seasonality causes our operating results and cash needs to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. additionally, any decrease in sales or profitability during the second half of the fiscal year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations. changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate merchandise sales and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl's credit card accounts are owned by an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations are shared similar to the revenue when interest rates exceed defined amounts. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. an inability to attract and retain quality associates could result in higher payroll costs and adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality associates. many of those associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. many of our strategic initiatives require that we hire and/or develop associates with appropriate experience. our staffing needs are especially high during the holiday season. competition for these associates is intense. we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, actions by our competitors in compensation levels and changing demographics. competitive and regulatory pressures have already significantly increased our labor costs. further changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance and/or profitability. in addition, changes in federal and state laws relating to employee benefits, including, but not limited to, sick time, paid time off, leave of absence, wage-and-hour, overtime, meal-and-break 8 table of contents time and joint/co-employment could cause us to incur additional costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. capital risks our inability to raise additional capital and maintain bank credit on favorable terms could adversely affect our business and financial condition. we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital to partially fund our operations and growth. we have also historically maintained lines of credit with financial institutions. changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. if our credit ratings fall below desirable levels, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. additionally, if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). if our access to capital was to become significantly constrained or our cost of capital was to increase significantly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and/or shareholder value. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. legal and regulatory risks regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. the costs and other effects of new or changed legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services, reduce the availability of raw materials or further restrict our ability to extend credit to our customers. we continually monitor the state and federal legal/regulatory environment for developments that may impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and/or loss of associate morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise out of the conduct of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer, associate or company information could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer, associate and company information. the protection of this data is extremely important to us, our associates and our customers. despite the considerable security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. 9 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2016 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the kohl's credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables as interest rates exceed defined rates. as a result, our share of profits from the credit 29 table of contents card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. the reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance, and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.quantitative

increases in real estate, construction and development costs could limit the company growth opportunities and affect its return on investment. there can be no assurance that such stores or sites will be available to the company for purchase or lease, or that they will be available on terms acceptable to the company. if the company is unable to grow its retail business, the company financial performance could be adversely affected. regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect the company business. various aspects of the company operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. the company continually monitors the state and federal employment law environment for developments that may adversely impact the company. failure to 7 table of contents detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of the company reputation, disruption of business and or loss of employee morale. additionally, the company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the company business operations and financial performance. the company business and reputation are linked with its proprietary brands. the company develops and promotes private and exclusive

the company normal course of business, it collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential customer information. despite the security measures the company has in place, its facilities and systems, and those of its third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by the company or its vendors, could severely damage its reputation, expose it to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt its operations and harm its business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates or borrowings. at february 3, 2007 and january, 28, 2006, the company long-term debt, excluding capital leases, was $895.8 million and $996.7 million, respectively, all of which is fixed rate debt. long-term fixed rate debt is utilized as a primary source of capital. when these debt instruments mature, the company may refinance such debt at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. if interest rates on the existing fixed rate debt outstanding at february 3, 2007 and january 28, 2006 changed by 100 basis points, the company annual interest expense would change by $9.0 million at february 3, 2007 and $10.0 million at january 28, 2006. during fiscal 2006, average borrowings under the company variable rate revolving credit facilities were $19.0 million. during fiscal 2005, the company average borrowings under the variable rate revolving credit facilities and the short-term financing of its proprietary accounts receivable were $79.0 million. if interest rates on the average fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, the company annual interest expense would change by $190,000 and $790,000, respectively, assuming comparable borrowing levels. during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, the company did not enter into any derivative financial instruments.risk factors 7 risk factors forward looking statements items 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 7a of this form 10-k contain forward-looking statements, made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. words such as believes, anticipates, plans, may, intends, will, should, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. in addition, statements covering our future sales or financial performance and our plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions are forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store openings and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligations to update them. 7 table of contents general economic conditions affect our business. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. in addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. a continued or incremental slowdown in the u.s. economy or an uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. the highly competitive retail environment could adversely affect our operating results. the retail business is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors, some of which have a greater market presence than kohl s, include traditional store-based retailers, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect our performance. our sales depend on consumer preferences and, increasingly, on fashion trends. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. capital efficiency and proper allocation. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to continue to produce similar financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our operating results. our credit card operations facilitate sales in our stores and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. our ability to extend credit to our customers depends on many factors including compliance with federal and state banking and consumer protection laws, any of which may change from time to time. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. in april 2006, we completed the sale of our private label credit card accounts and the outstanding balances associated with the accounts. as a result of the sale, the credit card operations are now subject to numerous federal laws that impose disclosure requirements upon the origination, servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a provider. the effect of these regulations or any changes in regulations of credit agreements could affect our results. 8 table of contents weather conditions can materially affect our operating results. because a significant portion of our business is apparel and subject to weather conditions in our markets, our operating results may be unexpectedly and adversely affected. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns or diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. our business is seasonal. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our success is dependent on our ability to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. the merchandise we sell is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws and our required standards of conduct. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult with respect to goods sourced outside the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. our success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain quality employees. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of quality associates. many of those associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance. our inability to open new stores could adversely affect our operating results. our plan to continue to increase the number of our stores will depend in part upon the availability of existing retail stores or store sites on acceptable terms. increases in real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and affect our return on investment. there can be no assurance that such stores or sites will be available for purchase or lease, or that they will be available on acceptable terms. if we are unable to grow our retail business, our financial performance could be adversely affected. regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. we continually monitor the state and federal employment law environment for developments that may adversely impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and or loss of employee morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. our business and reputation are linked with our proprietary brands. we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition. reputational damages incurred to the private and exclusive label brand names may generate negative customer sentiment, potentially resulting in a reduction in sales, earnings, and thus shareholder value. 9 table of contents disruptions in our information systems could adversely affect our operating results. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls.com website. we possess offsite recovery capabilities for our information systems. the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability. unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information, whether through a breach of our computer system or otherwise, could severely harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information. despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2007 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. for 2007, average borrowings under our revolving credit facilities were $62.7 million. if interest rates on the average 2007 variable rate debt changed by 100 basis points, our annual interest expense would change by $627,000, assuming comparable borrowing levels. we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments in 2007, 2006 or 2005.risk factors 7

materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligations to update them. declines in general economic conditions, consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and cause reductions in our sales and/or gross margin. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. in addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. the recent economic slowdown has caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy and declining consumer and business confidence, which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items. a continued or incremental slowdown in the united states economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. actions by our competitors could adversely affect our operating results. the retail business is highly

performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. ineffective marketing could adversely affect our sales and profitability. in 2008, advertising costs, net of related vendor allowances, were $890 million. we believe that differentiating kohls in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands, which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty, increase the number of customers that shop our stores and increase our sales. if our marketing programs are not successful, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. we may be unable to raise additional capital, if needed, or to raise capital on favorable terms. recently, the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to and cost of capital. if our existing cash, cash generated from operations and funds available on our lines of credit were insufficient to fund our future activities, including capital expenditures, or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). failure to obtain capital on acceptable terms, or at all, when required by our business circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us including an inability to fund new growth and other capital expenditures. inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and/or shareholder value. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. changes in our

additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. in connection with the april 2006 sale of our proprietary credit card accounts to jpmorgan chase &amp; co. ( jpmorgan chase ), we entered into a revenue-sharing agreement with jpmorgan chase, which issues kohl branded private label credit cards to new and existing kohl customers. net revenues of the program are shared with jpmorgan chase according to a fixed percentage and are settled monthly. net revenues include finance charge and late fee revenues, less write-offs of uncollectible accounts and other expenses. the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 (the card act ) mandates fundamental changes to many of our current business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. most of the requirements became effective in february 2010 and others will become effective in august 2010. legislation has been proposed to accelerate the effective date of all of the card act provisions effective as soon as the legislation is enacted, but prospects for enactment are uncertain. although the federal reserve has issued final rules implementing most of the provisions of the card act, it has yet to issue rules implementing the provisions that take effect in august 2010. accordingly, it is difficult to assess the impact of those provisions at this time. while we have already made, and anticipate making additional, changes designed to lessen the impact of the changes required by the card act, there is no assurance that we will be successful. if we are not able to lessen the impact of the changes required by the card act, the changes could adversely impact the profitability of our credit operations and make it more difficult to extend credit to our customers and collect payments which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. our current agreement with jpmorgan chase expires in 2011. we are currently exploring various alternatives to this agreement, including entering into a new agreement with an alternative partner and expect to reach a decision by fall 2010. this timing could be impacted by the timing of the issuance of final card act regulations. we may be unable to negotiate a new contract at comparable terms which could significantly reduce the net revenues which we currently earn under this program. should we be unable to negotiate a new agreement, we may repurchase the receivables. we currently expect to use a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand and new debt to finance such a repurchase. as of january 30, 2010, outstanding receivables totaled approximately $3 billion. the outstanding receivable balance fluctuates during the year and typically reaches its highest level during the holiday season and its lowest level during the first quarter of the year.

of sensitive or confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information. despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. new legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results. our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by new legal requirements, including proposed health care reform legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. at this point, we are unable to determine the impact that healthcare reform could have on our employer-sponsored medical plans. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2009 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. cash equivalents and long-term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. during 2009, average investments were $1.6 billion and average yield was 0.6%. if interest rates on the average 2009 variable rate cash equivalents and long-term investments increased by 100 basis points, our annual interest income would also increase by approximately $16 million assuming comparable investment levels. we were not a party to any material derivative financial instruments in 2009, 2008 or 2007.risk factors 7 risk factors forward looking statements items 1, 3, 5, 7 and 7a of this form 10-k contain forward-looking statements, made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. words such as believes, anticipates, plans, may, intends, will, should, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. in addition, statements covering our future sales or financial performance and our plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions are forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store openings and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligations to update them. declines in general economic conditions, consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and cause reductions in our sales and/or gross margin. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. in addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. 7 table of contents recent economic conditions have caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy and declining consumer and business confidence, which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items. a continued or incremental slowdown in the u.s. economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. actions by our competitors could adversely affect our operating results. the retail business is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors, some of which have a greater market presence than kohl s, include traditional store-based retailers, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect our performance. product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and operating results. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns, could have a negative impact on our sales. if we do not offer merchandise our customers want and fail to successfully manage our inventory levels, our sales and/or gross margin may be adversely impacted. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. ineffective marketing could adversely affect our sales and profitability. in 2010, advertising costs, net of related vendor allowances, were $869 million. we believe that differentiating kohl in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands, which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty, increase the number of customers that shop our stores and increase our sales. if our marketing programs are not successful, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. we may be unable to raise additional capital, if needed, or to raise capital on favorable terms. in recent years, the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly and have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital. if our existing cash, cash generated from operations and funds available on our lines of credit are insufficient to fund our future activities, including capital expenditures, or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). failure to obtain capital on acceptable terms, or at all, 8 table of contents when required by our business circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us including an inability to fund new growth and other capital expenditures. in 2010, we entered into a derivative product to manage our exposure to interest rates on debt that we expect to issue in late 2011. disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could lead to losses on this derivative position resulting from counterparty failures. inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and/or shareholder value. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate sales in our stores and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl credit card accounts have been sold to an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net revenues of the program according to a fixed percentage. net revenues are settled monthly and include finance charge and late fee revenues, less write-offs of uncollectible accounts and other expenses. in august 2010, we entered into a private label credit card program agreement with capital one, national association ( capital one ), which will be effective upon transition of the outstanding receivables from our former partner to capital one. we currently expect this transition to occur in the first fiscal quarter of 2011. kohl and capital one will share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. weather conditions could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability by affecting consumer shopping patterns. because a significant portion of our business is apparel and subject to weather conditions in our markets, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns or diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. our business is seasonal, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 9 table of contents we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. approximately 23% of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third party purchasing agent. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. all of our vendors must comply with applicable laws and our required terms of engagement. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult with respect to goods sourced outside the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. if any of our vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results. we are beginning to experience inflation in our merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor costs. the cost of cotton, which is a key raw material in many of our products, has had the most dramatic increases. the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and government policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, such as cotton, have not materially affected our cost of goods in recent years, but an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our profitability; while any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. an inability to attract and retain quality employees could result in higher payroll costs and adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of quality associates. many of those associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance. an inability to open new stores could adversely affect our financial performance. our plan to continue to increase the number of our stores will depend in part upon the availability of existing retail stores or store sites on acceptable terms. increases in real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and affect our return on investment. there can be no assurance that such stores or sites will be available for purchase or lease, or that they will be available on acceptable terms. if we are unable to grow our retail business, our financial performance could be adversely affected. regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. we continually monitor the state and federal employment law environment 10 table of contents for developments that may adversely impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and/or loss of employee morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. damage to the reputation of the kohl brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales. we believe the kohl brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition. in some cases, the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of our brand names or any affiliated individuals, could arise from product failures, litigation or various forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets, and may generate negative customer sentiment, potentially resulting in a reduction in sales, earnings, and shareholder value. disruptions in our information systems could adversely affect our sales and profitability. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls.com website. the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability. unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could severely

unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. new legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results. our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by new legal requirements, including health care reform and proposed climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. in march 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 were signed into law in the u.s. this legislation expands health care coverage to many uninsured individuals and expands coverage to those already insured. the changes required by this legislation could cause us to incur additional health care and other costs, but we do not expect any material short-term impact on our financial results as a result of the legislation and are currently assessing the extent of any long-term impact. the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 (the card act ) mandated fundamental changes in 2010 to many of our current business credit card practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing (specifically restrictions on late and other penalty fees). while we have made numerous changes designed to lessen the impact of the changes required by the card act, there is no assurance that we will be successful. if we are not able to lessen the impact of the changes required by the card act, the 11 table of contents changes could adversely impact the profitability of our credit operations and make it more difficult to extend credit to our customers and collect payments which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. the costs and other effects of other new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 34 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2010 is at fixed

risk on the first $200 million of debt that we expect to issue in 2011. amounts related to this financial instrument were not material and we were not a party to any other material derivative financial instruments in 2010, 2009 or 2008.risk factors 6 risk factors forward looking statements items 1, 3, 5, 7 and 7a of this form 10-k/a contain forward-looking statements, made within the

statements. in addition, statements covering our future sales or financial performance and our plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions are forward-looking statements, such as statements regarding our liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store openings and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including among others, those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligations to update them. declines in general economic conditions, consumer spending levels and other conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for our merchandise and cause reductions in our sales and/or gross margin. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. in addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. 6 recent economic conditions have caused disruptions and significant volatility in financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy and declining consumer and business confidence, which has led to decreased levels of consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items. a continued or incremental slowdown in the u.s. economy and the uncertain economic outlook could continue to adversely affect consumer spending habits resulting in lower net sales and profits than expected on a quarterly or annual basis. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. actions by our competitors could adversely affect our operating results. the retail business is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors, some of which have a greater market presence than kohl s, include traditional store-based retailers, internet and catalog businesses and other forms of retail commerce. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect our performance. product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and operating results. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns, could have a negative impact on our sales. if we do not offer merchandise our customers want and fail to successfully manage our inventory levels, our sales and/or gross margin may be adversely impacted. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. ineffective marketing could adversely affect our sales and profitability. we believe that differentiating kohl in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our brands, which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty, increase the number of customers that shop our stores and increase our sales. if our marketing programs are not successful, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. we may be unable to raise additional capital, if needed, or to raise capital on favorable terms. if our existing cash, cash generated from operations and other sources, and funds available on our lines of credit are insufficient to fund our future activities, including capital expenditures, or repay debt when it becomes due, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). failure to obtain capital on acceptable terms, or at all, when required by our business circumstances could have a material adverse effect on us including an inability to fund new growth and other capital expenditures. 7 inefficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely affect our operating results and/or shareholder value. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. changes in our credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate sales in our stores and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl credit card accounts have been sold to an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations will be shared similar to the revenue if interest rates exceed defined amounts. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. growth in our e-commerce business could adversely affect some of our operating metrics. in recent years, we have experienced significant growth in our e-commerce business. some of this growth has resulted in lower sales in our stores. though this has no impact on our consolidated sales, it has had a negative affect on our net income as a percentage of sales as our stores are currently more profitable than our e-commerce business. this profitability variance is due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, a higher mix of lower margin merchandise in our e-commerce business, shipping costs, and investments to provide the infrastructure necessary to grow the e-commerce business. though we are aggressively working to improve the profitability of our e-commerce business, there can be no assurances that our e-commerce business will become as profitable as our stores. weather conditions could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability by affecting consumer shopping patterns. because a significant portion of our business is apparel and subject to weather conditions in our markets, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods and hurricanes; or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns, diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise and/or causing physical damage to our properties. our business is seasonal, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. this seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. approximately 25% of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third party purchasing agent. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. all of our vendors 8 must comply with applicable laws and our required terms of engagement. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult with respect to goods sourced outside the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade, and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results. we could again experience inflation in our merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor costs as we did during 2011. the cost of cotton, which is a key raw material in many of our products, had the most dramatic increase in 2011. the price and availability of cotton may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, acreage devoted to cotton crops and crop yields, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and government policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. fluctuations in the price and availability of fuel, labor and raw materials, such as cotton, could again affect our cost of goods and an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our profitability; while any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. an inability to attract and retain quality employees could result in higher payroll costs and adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of quality associates. many of those associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance. an inability to open new stores could adversely affect our financial performance. our ability to open additional new stores will depend, in part, upon the availability of existing retail stores or store sites on acceptable terms. increases in real estate, construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities and affect our return on investment. there can be no assurance that such stores or sites will be available for purchase or lease, or that they will be available on acceptable terms. if we are unable to grow our retail business, our financial performance could be adversely affected. regulatory and litigation developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. such laws, rules and regulations include, among other areas, general credit regulations which could impact our credit card operations; health care reform which could cause us to incur additional health care and other costs; environmental legislation which could cause us to incur additional remediation and/or maintenance costs; and labor and employment laws which could impact our hiring and employment practices. 9 the costs and other effects of other new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. we continually monitor the state and federal employment environment for developments that may impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and/or loss of employee morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. damage to the reputation of the kohl brand or our private and exclusive brands could adversely affect our sales. we believe the kohl brand name and many of our private and exclusive brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools and we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. we develop and promote private and exclusive brands that have generated national recognition. in some cases, the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of our brand names or any affiliated individuals, could arise from product failures, litigation or various forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets, and may generate negative customer sentiment, potentially resulting in a reduction in sales, earnings, and shareholder value. disruptions in our information systems could adversely affect our sales and profitability. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls.com website. the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm sales and profitability. unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer, employee and company information. the protection of this data is extremely important to us, our employees and our customers. despite the considerable security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2011 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. cash equivalents and long-term investments earn interest at variable rates and are affected by changes in interest rates. during 2011, average investments were $1.6 billion and average yield was 0.3%. if interest rates on the average 2011 variable rate cash equivalents and long-term investments increased by 100 basis points, our annual interest income would also increase by approximately $16 million assuming comparable investment levels. we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the kohl credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables if interest rates were to exceed defined rates. as a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. the reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance, and can not be reasonably estimated at this time.risk factors 5 risk factors this form 10-k contains forward-looking statements made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "may," "intends," "will," "should," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements also include comments about our future sales or financial performance and our plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions, such as statements regarding our liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future business initiatives, and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. there are a number of important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements including, among others, those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update them. our sales, gross margin, expenses and operating results could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those described below. many of these risk factors are outside of our control. if we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact on our sales, gross margin, expenses, and/or operating results. macroeconomic and industry risks general economic conditions, consumer spending levels and/or other conditions could decline. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and fuel costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions, and the consumer's disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. the moderate income consumer, which is our core customer, is especially sensitive to these factors. a slowdown in the u.s. economy or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. our competitors could make changes to their pricing and other practices. the retail industry is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those competitors include traditional department stores, upscale mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. 5 table of contents we consider style, quality and price to be the most significant competitive factors in our industry. the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to digital channels has increased our challenges in differentiating ours elves from other retailers especially as it relates to national brands. in particular, consumers are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price. unanticipated changes in the pricin g and other practices of our competitors may adversely affect our performance. tax and trade policies could adversely change. uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries has recently increased. we source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside of the united states, primarily in asia. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. operational risks we may be unable to offer merchandise that resonates with existing customers and attracts new customers as well as successfully manage our inventory levels. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. approximately 25% of the merchandise we sell is sourced through a third-party purchasing agent. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the united states, substantially all of which are shipped by ocean to ports in the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, work stoppages, port strikes, port congestion and delays and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of merchandise sold. the price and availability of raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our profitability. any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, a decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. 6 table of contents our vendors may not adhere to our terms of engagement or to applicable laws. a substantial portion of our merchandise is received from vendors and factories outside of the united states. we require all of our suppliers to comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations and our terms of engagement for kohl's business partners. these terms of engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations, employment practices, ethical standards, environmental and legal requirements, communication, monitoring/compliance, record keeping, subcontracting and corrective action. from time to time, suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more suppliers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results of operations. our marketing may be ineffective. we believe that differentiating kohl's in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing and loyalty programs to increase awareness of our brands and to build personalized connections with new and existing customers. we believe these programs will strengthen customer loyalty, increase the number and frequency of customers that shop our stores and website and increase our sales. if our marketing and loyalty programs are not successful, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected. the reputation of the kohl's brand or our proprietary brands could be damaged. we believe the kohl's brand name and many of our proprietary brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools. we devote significant resources to promoting and protecting them. we develop and promote proprietary brands that have generated national recognition. in some cases, the brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of the kohl's brand, our proprietary brand names or any affiliated individuals, could arise from product failures; concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions where merchandise is produced; perceptions of our pricing and return policies; litigation; vendor violations of our terms of engagement; or various other forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets. damage to our reputation may result in a reduction in sales, earnings, and shareholder value. there may be concerns about the safety of products that we sell. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs, and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns, could have a negative impact on our sales and operating results. we may be unable to adequately maintain and/or update our information systems. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, and merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales though the operations of our kohls.com website. we frequently make investments that will help maintain and update our existing information systems. the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives or the failure of our information systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business and harm our sales and profitability. 7 table of contents our information technology projects may not yield their intended results. we regularly have internal information technology projects in process. although the technology is intended to increase productivity and operating efficiencies, these projects may not yield their intended results or may deliver an adverse user or customer experience. we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation, ongoing use, or discontinuation of technology projects, or fail to successfully implement these technology initiatives or achieve the anticipated efficiencies from such projects, any of which could adversely affect our operations, liquidity and financial condition. weather conditions could adversely affect consumer shopping patterns. a significant portion of our business is apparel and is subject to weather conditions. as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, and hurricanes; or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns, diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise and/or causing physical damage to our properties. we may be unable to successfully execute an omnichannel strategy. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving. customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology and omnichannel experiences. our ability to compete may also suffer if kohl's, our suppliers, or our third-party shipping and delivery vendors are unable to effectively and efficiently fulfill and deliver orders, especially during the holiday season when sales volumes are especially high. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our business is seasonal in nature, which could negatively affect our revenues, operating results and cash requirements. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. if we do not properly stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we may fail to meet customer demand, which could affect our revenue and our future growth. if we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. we may experience an increase in costs associated with shipping digital orders due to complimentary upgrades, split shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. if too many customers access our website within a short period of time, we may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. also, third-party delivery and direct ship vendors may be unable to deliver merchandise on a timely basis. this seasonality causes our operating results and cash needs to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. additionally, any decrease in sales or profitability during the second half of the fiscal year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations. 8 table of contents changes in credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate merchandise sales and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl's credit card accounts are owned by an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations are shared similar to the revenue when interest rates exceed defined amounts. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use, payment patterns and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain quality associates while controlling costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality associates, including our senior management team and other key associates. many associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. many of our strategic initiatives require that we hire and/or develop associates with appropriate experience. our staffing needs are especially high during the holiday season. competition for these associates is intense. we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, actions by our competitors in compensation levels, potential labor organizing efforts, and changing demographics. competitive and regulatory pressures have already significantly increased our labor costs. further changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance and/or profitability. in addition, changes in federal and state laws relating to employee benefits, including, but not limited to, sick time, paid time off, leave of absence, wage-and-hour, overtime, meal-and-break time and joint/co-employment could cause us to incur additional costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. capital risks we may be unable to raise additional capital or maintain bank credit on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital to partially fund our operations and growth. we have also historically maintained lines of credit with financial institutions. changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. if our credit ratings fall below desirable levels, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. additionally, if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). if our access to capital was to become significantly constrained or our cost of capital was to increase significantly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 9 table of contents our capital allocation could be inefficient or ineffective. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. legal and regulatory risks regulatory and legal matters could adversely affect our business operations and change financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. the costs and other effects of new or changed legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services, reduce the availability of raw materials or further restrict our ability to extend credit to our customers. we continually monitor the state and federal legal/regulatory environment for developments that may impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and/or loss of associate morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise out of the conduct of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. sensitive or confidential customer, associate or company information could be improperly disclosed or lost, which could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer, associate and company information. the protection of this data is extremely important to us, our associates and our customers. despite the considerable security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, system failures, acts of vandalism, fraud, misappropriation, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or employee negligence, or other similar events. any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2017 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at then existing market interest rates, which may be more

portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. the reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance. recent increases in interest rates have not had a material impact on our financial results. the impact of future increases, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.risk factors 5 risk factors this form 10-k contains forward-looking statements made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of

income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions, and the consumer's disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. the moderate-income consumer, which is our core customer, is especially sensitive to these factors. a slowdown in the u.s. economy or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. our competitors could make changes to their pricing and other practices. the retail industry is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional and national retailers. those 5 table of contents competitors include traditi onal department stores, mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. we consider style, quality, price, and convenience to be the most significant competitive factors in our industry. the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to digital channels have increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers especially as it relates to national brands. in particular, consumers can quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors may adversely affect our performance. tax and trade policies could adversely change. uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries has recently increased. we source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside of the united states, primarily in asia. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity. operational risks we may be unable to offer merchandise that resonates with existing customers and attracts new customers as well as successfully manage our inventory levels. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. a third-party purchasing agent sources approximately 25% of the merchandise we sell. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the united states, substantially all of which are shipped by ocean to ports in the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, work stoppages, port strikes, port congestion and delays and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of merchandise sold. the price and availability of raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and policy, economic climates, market speculation and other unpredictable factors. an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our profitability. any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, a reduction in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. 6 table of contents our vendors may not adhere to our terms of engagement or to applicable laws. a substantial portion of our merchandise is received from vendors and factories outside of the united states. we require all of our suppliers to comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations and our terms of engagement for kohl's business partners. these terms of engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations, employment practices, ethical standards, environmental and legal requirements, communication, monitoring/compliance, record keeping, subcontracting and corrective action. from time to time, suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more suppliers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results of operations. our marketing may be ineffective. we believe that differentiating kohl's in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing and loyalty programs to increase awareness of our brands and to build personalized connections with new and existing customers. we believe these programs will strengthen customer loyalty, increase the number and frequency of customers that shop our stores and website and increase our sales. if our marketing and loyalty programs are not successful, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected. the reputation and brand image of kohl's and the brands and products we sell could be damaged. we believe the kohl's brand name and many of our proprietary brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools. we devote significant resources to develop, promote and protect proprietary brands that generate national recognition. in some cases, the proprietary brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. we also affiliate the kohl's brand with third-party national brands that we sell in our store and through our partnerships with companies in pursuit of strategic initiatives. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of the kohl's brand, our proprietary brand names or any affiliated individuals or companies with which we have partnered, could arise from product failures; concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions where merchandise is produced; perceptions of our pricing and return policies; litigation; vendor violations of our terms of engagement; perceptions of the national vendors and/or third party companies with which we partner; or various other forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets. this type of reputational damage may result in a reduction in sales, earnings, and shareholder value. there may be concerns about the safety of products that we sell. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs, and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could have a negative impact on our sales and operating results. we may be unable to adequately maintain and/or update our information systems. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. in particular, we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, and merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales through the operations of our kohls.com website. we frequently make investments that will help maintain and update our existing information systems. we also depend on third parties as it relates to our information systems. in particular, we are currently migrating certain systems and applications to cloud environments that are hosted by third-party service providers. the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives, the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or the failure to successfully partner with our third party service providers, such as our cloud platform providers, could disrupt our business and harm our sales and profitability. 7 table of contents our information technology projects may not yield their intended results. we regularly have internal information technology projects in process. although the technology is intended to increase productivity and operating efficiencies, these projects may not yield their intended results or may deliver an adverse user or customer experience. we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation, ongoing use, or discontinuation of technology projects, or fail to successfully implement these technology initiatives or achieve the anticipated efficiencies from such projects, any of which could adversely affect our operations, liquidity and financial condition. weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect consumer shopping patterns and disrupt our operations. a significant portion of our business is apparel and is subject to weather conditions. as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, and hurricanes; or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns and diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. in addition, these events could cause physical damage to our properties or impact our supply chain, making it difficult or impossible to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, our mitigation strategies may be inadequate to address such a major disruption event. we may be unable to successfully execute an omnichannel strategy. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving. customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology and omnichannel experiences. our ability to compete may also suffer if kohl's, our suppliers, or our third-party shipping and delivery vendors are unable to effectively and efficiently fulfill and deliver orders, especially during the holiday season when sales volumes are especially high. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our business is seasonal in nature, which could negatively affect our revenues, operating results and cash requirements. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. if we do not adequately stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we may fail to meet customer demand, which could affect our revenue and our future growth. if we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. we may experience an increase in costs associated with shipping digital orders due to complimentary upgrades, split shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. if too many customers access our website within a short period of time, we may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. also, third-party delivery and direct ship vendors may be unable to deliver merchandise on a timely basis. 8 table of contents this seasonality causes our operating results and cash needs to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. additionally, any decrease in sales or profitability during the second half of the fiscal year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations. changes in credit card operations could adversely affect our sales and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate merchandise sales and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl's credit card accounts are owned by an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations are shared similar to the revenue when interest rates exceed defined amounts. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use and applications, payment patterns, credit fraud and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. we may be unable to attract, develop and retain quality associates while controlling costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality associates, including our senior management team and other key associates. many associates are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. many of our strategic initiatives require that we hire and/or develop associates with appropriate experience. our staffing needs are especially high during the holiday season. competition for these associates is intense. we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, actions by our competitors in compensation levels, potential labor organizing efforts, and changing demographics. competitive and regulatory pressures have already significantly increased our labor costs. further changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance and/or profitability. in addition, changes in federal and state laws relating to employee benefits, including, but not limited to, sick time, paid time off, leave of absence, wage-and-hour, overtime, meal-and-break time and joint/co-employment could cause us to incur additional costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. capital risks we may be unable to raise additional capital or maintain bank credit on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital to partially fund our operations and growth. we have also historically maintained lines of credit with financial institutions. changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and maintaining strong debt ratings. if our credit ratings fall below desirable levels, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. additionally, if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). if our access to capital was to become significantly constrained or our cost of capital was to increase significantly our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 9 table of contents our capital allocation could be inefficient or ineffective. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. legal and regulatory risks regulatory and legal matters could adversely affect our business operations and change financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. the costs and other effects of new or changed legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services, reduce the availability of raw materials or further restrict our ability to extend credit to our customers. we continually monitor the state and federal legal and regulatory environments for developments that may impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business and/or loss of associate morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise out of the conduct of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. our efforts to protect the security of sensitive or confidential customer, associate or company information could be unsuccessful, which could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, retain, process and transmit sensitive and confidential customer, associate and company information. we also engage third-party vendors that provide technology, systems and services to facilitate our collection, retention, processing and transmission of this information. the protection of this data is extremely important to us, our associates and our customers. as with other companies, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party vendors are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, security breaches, system failures, acts of vandalism, fraud, misappropriation, malware and other malicious or harmful code, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, insider threats, or other similar events. despite our substantial investments in personnel, training and implementation of programs, procedures, and plans to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information and to prevent, detect, contain and respond to cybersecurity threats, there is no assurance that these measures will be adequate to prevent all such cybersecurity threats, particularly given the ever-evolving and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber-attack that may be difficult or impossible to anticipate and/or detect. in addition, the regulatory environment related to data privacy and cybersecurity is constantly changing, which may increase our compliance costs and impact our customers' shopping experience. any data security incident involving the breach, misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and/or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. 10 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2018 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at the existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the kohl's credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables as interest rates exceed defined rates. as a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. the reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance. recent increases in interest rates have not had a material impact on our financial results. the impact of future increases, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 33 table of contentsrisk factors 5 risk factors this form 10-k contains forward-looking statements made within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "may," "intends," "will," "should," "expects," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements may include comments about our future sales or financial performance and our plans, performance and other objectives, expectations or intentions, such as statements regarding our liquidity, debt service requirements, planned capital expenditures, future store initiatives, and adequacy of capital resources and reserves. forward-looking statements are based on management's then-current views and assumptions and, as a result, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. as such, forward-looking statements are qualified by those risk factors described below. forward-looking statements relate to the date made, and we undertake no obligation to update them. our sales, revenues, gross margin, expenses, and operating results could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, but not limited to those described below. many of these risk factors are outside of our control. if we are not successful in managing these risks, they could have a negative impact on our sales, revenues, gross margin, expenses, and/or operating results. macroeconomic and industry risks actual or threatened epidemics, pandemics, outbreaks, or other public health crises may adversely affect our customers' financial condition and the operations of our business. our business could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (covid-19). the risk of a pandemic, or public perception of the risk, could cause customers to avoid public places, including retail properties, and could cause temporary or long-term disruptions in our supply chains and/or delays in the delivery of our inventory. further, such risks could also adversely affect our customers' financial condition, resulting in reduced spending for the merchandise we sell. moreover, an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak or other public health crisis, such as covid-19, could cause employees to avoid our properties, which could adversely affect our 5 table of contents ability to adequately st aff and manage our businesses. risks related to an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as covid-19, could also lead to the complete or partial closure of one or more of our stores, facilities or operat ions of our sourcing partners. the ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent their further spread, among others. these and other potential impacts of an epidemic, pandemic or other health crisis, such as covid-19, could therefore materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions, consumer spending levels, and/or other conditions could decline. consumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by many factors including prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates, housing costs, energy and fuel costs, income tax rates and policies, consumer confidence, consumer perception of economic conditions, and the consumer's disposable income, credit availability, and debt levels. the moderate-income consumer, which is our core customer, is especially sensitive to these factors. a slowdown in the u.s. economy or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits. as all of our stores are located in the united states, we are especially susceptible to deteriorations in the u.s. economy. consumer confidence is also affected by the domestic and international political, public health and welfare situation. the outbreak or escalation of war, pandemics, or the occurrence of terrorist acts or other hostilities in or affecting the united states, could lead to a decrease in spending by consumers. our competitors could make changes to their pricing and other practices. the retail industry is highly competitive. we compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services, and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, and national retailers. those competitors include traditional department stores, mass merchandisers, off-price retailers, specialty stores, internet and catalog businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. we consider style, quality, price, and convenience to be the most significant competitive factors in our industry. the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to digital channels have increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other retailers especially as it relates to national brands. in particular, consumers can quickly and conveniently comparison shop with digital tools, which can lead to decisions based solely on price. unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of our competitors may adversely affect our performance. tax and trade policies could adversely change. uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries has recently increased. we source the majority of our merchandise from manufacturers located outside of the united states, primarily in asia. major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and liquidity. 6 table of contents operational risks we may be unable to offer merchandise that resonates with existing customers and attracts new customers as well as successfully manage our inventory levels. our business is dependent on our ability to anticipate fluctuations in consumer demand for a wide variety of merchandise. failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, preferences, spending patterns, and other lifestyle decisions could create inventory imbalances and adversely affect our performance and long-term relationships with our customers. additionally, failure to accurately predict changing consumer tastes may result in excess inventory, which could result in additional markdowns and adversely affect our operating results. we may be unable to source merchandise in a timely and cost-effective manner. a third-party purchasing agent sources approximately 20% of the merchandise we sell. the remaining merchandise is sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. our ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge which is typically even more difficult for goods sourced outside the united states, substantially all of which are shipped by ocean to ports in the united states. political or financial instability, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, pandemic outbreaks, work stoppages, port strikes, port congestion and delays, and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control and could adversely impact our performance. increases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel, and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of merchandise sold. the price and availability of raw materials may fluctuate substantially, depending on a variety of factors, including demand, weather, supply conditions, transportation costs, energy prices, work stoppages, government regulation and policy, economic climates, market speculation, and other unpredictable factors. an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with our pricing actions, might cause a decrease in our operating results. any related pricing actions might cause a decline in our sales volume. additionally, a reduction in the availability of raw materials could impair the ability to meet production or purchasing requirements in a timely manner. both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel, and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers. if any of our significant vendors were to become subject to bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceedings, we may be unable to arrange for alternate or replacement contracts, transactions, or business relationships on terms as favorable as current terms, which could adversely affect our sales and operating results. our vendors may not adhere to our terms of engagement or to applicable laws. a substantial portion of our merchandise is received from vendors and factories outside of the united states. we require all of our suppliers to comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations and our terms of engagement for kohl's business partners. these terms of engagement include provisions regarding laws and regulations, employment practices, ethical standards, environmental requirements, communication, monitoring and compliance, record keeping, subcontracting, and corrective action. from time to time, suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable laws. significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more suppliers could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results of operations. our marketing may be ineffective. we believe that differentiating kohl's in the marketplace is critical to our success. we design our marketing and loyalty programs to increase awareness of our brands and to build personalized connections with new and existing customers. we believe these programs will strengthen customer loyalty, increase the number and frequency of customers that shop our stores and website, and increase our sales. if our marketing and loyalty programs are not successful, our sales and operating results could be adversely affected. 7 table of contents the reputation and brand image of kohl's and the brands and products we sell could be damaged. we believe the kohl's brand name and many of our private brand names are powerful sales and marketing tools. we devote significant resources to develop, promote, and protect private brands that generate national recognition. in some cases, the private brands or the marketing of such brands are tied to or affiliated with well-known individuals. we also affiliate the kohl's brand with third-party national brands that we sell in our store and through our partnerships with companies in pursuit of strategic initiatives. damage to the reputations (whether or not justified) of the kohl's brand, our private brand names or any affiliated individuals or companies with which we have partnered, could arise from product failures concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions where merchandise is produced perceptions of our pricing and return policies litigation vendor violations of our terms of engagement perceptions of the national vendors and/or third party companies with which we partner or various other forms of adverse publicity, especially in social media outlets. this type of reputational damage may result in a reduction in sales, operating results, and shareholder value. there may be concerns about the safety of products that we sell. if our merchandise offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers' expectations regarding safety, we could experience lost sales, experience increased costs, and/or be exposed to legal and reputational risk. events that give rise to actual, potential, or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action and/or private litigation. reputational damage caused by real or perceived product safety concerns could have a negative impact on our sales and operating results. we may be unable to adequately maintain and/or update our technology platforms. the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our technology platforms. in particular, we rely on our technology platforms to effectively manage sales, distribution, and merchandise planning and allocation functions. we also generate sales through the operations of our kohls.com website and mobile application. we frequently make investments that will help maintain and update our existing technology platforms. we also depend on third parties as it relates to our technology platforms. in particular, we are currently migrating certain systems and applications to cloud environments that are hosted by third-party service providers. the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives, the failure of our technology platforms to perform as designed, or the failure to successfully partner with our third party service providers, such as our cloud platform providers, could disrupt our business and harm our sales and profitability. our information technology projects may not yield their intended results. we regularly have internal information technology projects in process. although the technology is intended to increase productivity and operating efficiencies, these projects may not yield their intended results or may deliver an adverse user or customer experience. we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation, ongoing use, or discontinuation of technology projects, or we may fail to successfully implement these technology initiatives, or achieve the anticipated efficiencies from such projects, any of which could adversely affect our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect consumer shopping patterns and disrupt our operations. a significant portion of our business is apparel and is subject to weather conditions. as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions. frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, fires, and hurricanes or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our performance by affecting consumer shopping patterns and diminishing demand for seasonal merchandise. in addition, these events could cause physical damage to our properties or impact our supply chain, making it difficult or impossible to timely deliver seasonally appropriate merchandise. although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, our mitigation strategies may be inadequate to address such a major disruption event. 8 table of contents we may be unable to successfully execute an omnichannel strategy. customer expectations about the methods by which they purchase and receive products or services are evolving. customers are increasingly using technology and mobile devices to rapidly compare products and prices and to purchase products. once products are purchased, customers are seeking alternate options for delivery of those products. we must continually anticipate and adapt to these changes in the purchasing process. our ability to compete with other retailers and to meet our customer expectations may suffer if we are unable to provide relevant customer-facing technology and omnichannel experiences. our ability to compete may also suffer if kohl's, our suppliers, or our third-party shipping and delivery vendors are unable to effectively and efficiently fulfill and deliver orders, especially during the holiday season when sales volumes are especially high. consequently, our results of operations could be adversely affected. our business is seasonal in nature, which could negatively affect our sales, revenues, operating results, and cash requirements. our business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the back-to-school and holiday seasons. if we do not adequately stock or restock popular products, particularly during the back-to-school and holiday seasons, we may fail to meet customer demand, which could affect our revenue and our future growth. if we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs, which could reduce profitability. we may experience an increase in costs associated with shipping digital orders due to complimentary upgrades, split shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. if too many customers access our website within a short period of time, we may experience system interruptions that make our website unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. also, third-party delivery and direct ship vendors may be unable to deliver merchandise on a timely basis. this seasonality causes our operating results and cash needs to vary considerably from quarter to quarter. additionally, any decrease in sales or profitability during the second half of the fiscal year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations. changes in credit card operations could adversely affect our sales, revenues, and/or profitability. our credit card operations facilitate merchandise sales and generate additional revenue from fees related to extending credit. the proprietary kohl's credit card accounts are owned by an unrelated third-party, but we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the portfolio, which is defined as the sum of finance charges, late fees, and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. changes in funding costs related to interest rate fluctuations are shared similar to the revenue when interest rates exceed defined amounts. though management currently believes that increases in funding costs will be largely offset by increases in finance charge revenue, increases in funding costs could adversely impact the profitability of this program. changes in credit card use and applications, payment patterns, credit fraud, and default rates may also result from a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. changes that adversely impact our ability to extend credit and collect payments could negatively affect our results. 9 table of contents we may be unable to attract, develop , and retain quality associates while controlling costs, which could adversely affect our operating results. our performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large number of quality associates, including our senior management team and other key associates. many associates are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. many of our strategic initiatives require that we hire and/or develop associates with appropriate experience. our staffing needs are especially high during the holiday season. competition for these associates is intense. we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in future periods. our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation, actions by our competitors in compensation levels, potential labor organizing efforts, and changing demographics. competitive and regulatory pressures have already significantly increased our labor costs. further changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates could adversely affect our performance and/or profitability. in addition, changes in federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations relating to employee benefits, including, but not limited to, sick time, paid time off, leave of absence, wage-and-hour, overtime, meal-and-break time, and joint/co-employment could cause us to incur additional costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. capital risks we may be unable to raise additional capital or maintain bank credit on favorable terms, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital to partially fund our operations and growth. we have also historically maintained lines of credit with financial institutions. changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings. if our credit ratings fall below desirable levels, our ability to access the debt markets and our cost of funds for new debt issuances could be adversely impacted. additionally, if unfavorable capital market conditions exist if and when we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis (if at all). if our access to capital was to become significantly constrained or our cost of capital was to increase significantly, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. our capital allocation could be inefficient or ineffective. our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. this includes spending on inventory, capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning value to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. to a large degree, capital efficiency reflects how well we manage our other key risks. the actions taken to address other specific risks may affect how well we manage the more general risk of capital efficiency. if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns, we may fail to produce optimal financial results, and we may experience a reduction in shareholder value. 10 table of contents legal and regulatory risks regulatory and legal matters could adversely affect our business operations and change financial performance. various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. the costs and other effects of new or changed legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent such requirements increase prices of goods and services, reduce the availability of raw materials, or further restrict our ability to extend credit to our customers. we continually monitor the legal and regulatory environments for developments that may impact us. failure to detect changes and comply with such laws and regulations may result in an erosion of our reputation, disruption of business, and/or loss of associate morale. additionally, we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise out of the conduct of our business. litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. our efforts to protect the privacy and security of sensitive or confidential customer, associate, or company information could be unsuccessful, which could severely damage our reputation, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations, and harm our business. as part of our normal course of business, we collect, retain, process, and transmit sensitive and confidential customer, associate, and company information. we also engage third-party vendors that provide technology, systems, and services to facilitate our collection, retention, processing, and transmission of this information. the protection of this data is extremely important to us, our associates, and our customers. however, no security is perfect, and it is possible that our facilities and systems and those of our third-party vendors are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, security breaches, system failures, acts of vandalism, fraud, misappropriation, malware, ransomware, and other malicious or harmful code, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, insider threats, or other similar events. despite our substantial investments in personnel, training and implementation of programs, procedures, and plans to protect the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information and to prevent, detect, contain, and respond to cybersecurity threats, there is no assurance that these measures will prevent all cybersecurity threats, particularly given the ever-evolving and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber-attack that may be difficult or impossible to anticipate and/or detect. kohl's and its third party consultants audit and test our security program. any such data security incident involving the breach, misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive and/or confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers' willingness to shop in our stores or on our website, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material. in addition, data privacy and cybersecurity laws are in a period of change, including the new california consumer privacy act (the ccpa ), and there is potential for the enactment of other federal or state privacy laws relevant to our business. these legal changes may increase our compliance costs, impact our customers' shopping experience, reduce our business efficiency, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or data breach litigation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our long-term debt at year-end 2019 is at fixed interest rates and, therefore, is not affected by changes in interest rates. when our long-term debt instruments mature, we may refinance them at the existing market interest rates, which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt. we share in the net risk-adjusted revenue of the kohl's credit card portfolio as defined by the sum of finance charges, late fees, and other revenue less write-offs of uncollectible accounts. we also share the costs of funding the outstanding receivables as interest rates exceed defined rates. as a result, our share of profits from the credit card portfolio may be negatively impacted by increases in interest rates. the reduced profitability, if any, will be impacted by various factors, including our ability to pass higher funding costs on to the credit card holders and the outstanding receivable balance, and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 33 table of contents
