quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that has included in the past, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. the company had an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution, solely to manage its interest rate exposure on $175.0 million of its 5 &frac12;% senior notes. this swap agreement was terminated during june 2003 and the company received net proceeds of $5.3 million. although, as set forth below, the company zero coupon-subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company financial position or results of operations. the company zero coupon-subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under sfas no. 133: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero coupon-subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero coupon-subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero coupon-subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor ratings services is bb- or lower. based upon independent appraisals, these embedded derivatives had no fair market value at december 31, 2004. (40) borrowings under the company revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swap or other agreements. two of the company joint venture partnerships operate in canada and remit the company share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from these affiliates is subject to a certain amount of foreign currency exchange risk.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market

factors 22 risk factors risks associated with the company business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material effect upon the company business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including managed care organizations, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of the company business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced prices as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if we violate health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it conducts its operations and relationships with care in an effort to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 ( clia ) extend federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the company cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect its business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. (22) failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and we utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of the department of health and human services, or hhs, has issued final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. hhs issued guidance on july 24, 2003 stating that it will not penalize a covered entity for post-implementation date transactions that are not fully compliant with the transactions standards, if the covered entity can demonstrate its good faith efforts to comply with the standards. hhs stated purpose for this flexible enforcement position was to permit health plans to mitigate unintended adverse effects on covered entities cash flow and business operations during the transition to the standards, as well as on the availability and quality of patient care. as of october 1, 2005, the centers for medicare and medicaid services no longer processes incoming non-hipaa-compliant electronic medicare claims. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. as a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the company inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments or use of a national provider identifier, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. (23) compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, which became fully effective in april 2003 and april 2005, respectively, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; and administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy regulations and varying state privacy laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. the privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, the company also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is one of the most significant factors often used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. (24) failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies, or the company customers using new technologies to perform their own tests, may limit the company ability to successfully achieve its business strategy. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing businesses, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices, which could affect the company market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated managed-cost health care or new national or networking managed care purchasing models, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2007, the percentage of accessions by payer was: private patients - 2.1%, medicare and medicaid 17.1%, commercial clients - 31.9% and managed care 48.9%. a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. (25) mcos have different contracting philosophies. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and negotiate discounts to the fees charged by such laboratories. other mcos allow any willing provider to be contracted at specified discounted rates. the majority of the company managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service basis at a discount from its patient prices. such discounts have historically resulted in price erosion and have negatively impacted the company operating margins. in addition, mcos have used capitated payment contracts in an attempt to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated payment contract, the clinical laboratory and mco agree to a per member, per month payment to cover all laboratory tests during the month, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. such contracts shift the risk of additional testing beyond that covered by the capitated payment to the clinical laboratory. for the year ended december 31, 2007, capitated contracts accounted for approximately $167.5 million, or 4.1%, of the company net sales. recently, certain managed care companies have adopted or expressed interest in adopting new national or networking managed care laboratory services purchasing models. if the company is unable to participate in these new models, or if the company loses a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans is expected to increase. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursements and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. a failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, could impact the company ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. we compete primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company ability to expand its customer base. in addition, the company relies on developing alliances with hospitals to expand its business through appropriate collaborative agreements. the company ability to expand the number of alliances with hospitals and maintain current alliances, many of which are terminable on short notice, could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. (26) a failure to integrate newly acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. the successful integration of any business which the company may acquire in the future entails numerous risks, including, among others: loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of companies or businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects to result from such integration, including projected cost savings. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. a significant increase in the company days sales outstanding levels could have an adverse effect on the company business. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing more billing to patients as a result of the growth in billings to managed care fee-for-service plans which have patient co-pays and deductibles and an increase in high deductible health plans. with these high deductible health plans, the patient is responsible for more payments prior to insurance covering the cost of care. a material change in the company days sales outstanding level ( dso ) (27) resulting in an increase in the company bad debt expense and dso could have an adverse effect on the company business. failure in the company information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company operations. the company laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company information technology systems could adversely affect the company business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. the company operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company ability to transport specimens, the company ability to utilize certain laboratories or to receive material from its suppliers. reimbursement for services may be adversely impacted due to the failure of the company or covered health plans to satisfy hipaa standard transaction and code set requirements, including npi. the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa have required the department of health and human services to establish national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers ( npi ). cms has announced that it will require the npi on part b professional claims submitted to medicare after march 1, 2008 or it will reject such claims. the failure of the company or third parties to meet the npi requirements for medicare claims or other covered health plans could have a material adverse impact on the company reimbursement and profitability. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company operations are dependent upon the ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, the ongoing uncertainty in the credit markets could tighten the availability of credit and impact the company ability to finance its investing activities in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 48 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that has included in the past, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company financial position or results of operations. the company zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under sfas no. 133 accouting for derivative instruments and hedging activities : 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor ratings services is bb- or lower. the company believes these embedded derivatives had no fair value at december 31, 2007. borrowings under the company revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. two of the company joint venture partnerships operate in canada and remit the company share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from these affiliates is subject to a certain amount of foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 22 risk factors risks associated with the company business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material effect upon the

well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if we violate health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from

applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect its business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. 22 failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and we utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 may impose additional obligations on health care entities with respect to data privacy and security. the company is unable to predict the extent to which these new obligations may prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of the department of health and human services, or hhs, has issued final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. as a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the company inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and the icd-10-cm and icd-10 pcs codes sets, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. 23 compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, which became fully effective in april 2003 and april 2005, respectively, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining phi. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. the privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, the company also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is one of the most significant factors often used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. 24 discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products or failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies, or the company customers using new technologies to perform their own tests, could adversely affect the company business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing businesses, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices, which could affect the company market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated managed-cost health care or new national or networking managed care purchasing models, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2008, accessions (based on the total volume of accessions excluding the ontario, canada joint venture) by payer were: private patients 2.0% medicare and medicaid 17.3%, commercial clients 32.4% and managed care 48.3%. 25 a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. mcos have different contracting philosophies. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and negotiate fees charged by such laboratories. other mcos allow any willing provider to be contracted at specified rates. the majority of the company managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service basis at a discount from its patient prices. such discounts have historically resulted in price erosion and have negatively impacted the company operating margins. in addition, mcos have used capitated payment contracts in an attempt to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated payment contract, the clinical laboratory and mco agree to a per member, per month payment to cover all laboratory tests during the month, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. such contracts shift the risk of additional testing beyond that covered by the capitated payment to the clinical laboratory. for the year ended december 31, 2008, capitated contracts accounted for approximately $180.0 million, or 4.0%, of the company net sales. recently, certain managed care companies have adopted or expressed interest in adopting new national or networking managed care laboratory services purchasing models. if the company is unable to participate in these new models, or if the company loses a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans has increased. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursements and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. a failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, could impact the company ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. we compete primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company ability to expand its customer base. in addition, the company relies on developing alliances with hospitals to expand its business through appropriate collaborative agreements. the company ability to expand the number of alliances with hospitals and maintain current alliances, many of which are terminable on short notice, could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. 26 a failure to integrate newly acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. the successful integration of any business which the company may acquire in the future entails numerous risks, including, among others: loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of companies or businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects to result from such integration, including projected cost savings. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. a significant increase in the company days sales outstanding levels could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company business. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing more billing to patients as a result of the growth in billings to managed care fee-for-service plans which have patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles and an increase in high deductible health plans. with these high deductible health plans, the patient is responsible for more payments prior to insurance covering the cost of care. a material change in the company days sales outstanding level 27 ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company bad debt expense and dso could have an adverse effect on the company business. failure in the company information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company operations. the company laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company information technology systems could adversely affect the company business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. the company operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company ability to transport specimens, the company information technology systems, the company ability to utilize certain laboratories or to receive material from its suppliers. reimbursement for services may be adversely impacted due to the failure of the company or covered health plans to satisfy hipaa standard transaction and code set requirements, including npi. the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa have required the department of health and human services to establish national standards for electronic health care transactions and national identifiers for providers ( npi ). cms announced that it would require the npi on part b professional claims submitted to medicare after march 1, 2008 or it will reject such claims. the failure of the company or third parties to meet the npi requirements for medicare claims or other covered health plans could have a material adverse impact on the company reimbursement and profitability. the company has implemented npi within its claims systems. to the extent that issues related to npi have arisen with third parties, the company has resolved such issues without a material adverse impact. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company operations are dependent upon the ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, the ongoing uncertainty in the credit markets could tighten the availability of credit and impact the company ability to meet its financing needs in the future. changes in reimbursement by foreign governments and foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company business. the company has business and operations outside the united states. changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for the company services and foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company financial position or results of operations. the company zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under sfas no. 133 accouting for derivative instruments and hedging activities : 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor ratings services is bb- or lower. borrowings under the company revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. the company ontario, canada consolidated joint venture operates in canada and, accordingly, the earnings and cash flow generated from the ontario operation are subject to a certain amount of foreign currency exchange risk. the alberta, canada joint venture partnership operates in canada and remits the company share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from this affiliate is subject to a certain amount of foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 23 risk factors risks associated with the company's business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of the company's business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced prices as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if we violate health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it meets all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the company cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect its business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. 23 index failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company's laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and we utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of the department of health and human services, or hhs, has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. as a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company or the imposition of penalties. 24 index failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with version 5010 transactions or the icd-10-cm code set could adversely impact the company's reimbursement. the company is within the assessment and inventory phase to adopt version 5010 transactions and to adopt the icd-10-cm code set issued by hhs on january 16, 2009. the compliance date for version 5010 is january 1, 2012; the compliance date for icd-10-cm code set is october 1, 2013. the company will continue its assessment of information systems, applications and processes for compliance with these requirements. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company's costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining ephi. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. due to the very recent enactment of hitech, it is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be; however, if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. 25 index the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 may impose additional obligations on health care entities with respect to data privacy and security. the company is unable to predict the extent to which these new obligations may prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients

classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility 26 index from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. health care reform or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated managed-cost health care or new national or network managed care purchasing models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2009, requisitions (based on the total volume of requisitions excluding the ontario, canada joint venture) by payer were: private patients 1.9% medicare and medicaid 17.8%, commercial clients 31.5% and managed care 48.8%. mcos have different contracting philosophies. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and negotiate fees charged by such laboratories. other mcos allow any willing provider to be contracted at

capitated contracts accounted for approximately $167.4 million, or 3.6%, of the company's net sales. a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. recently, certain managed care companies have adopted or expressed interest in adopting new national or laboratory network purchasing models. if the company is unable to participate in these new models, or if the company loses a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. in addition, medicare

it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. 27 index a failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could

hospitals to expand its business through appropriate collaborative agreements. the company's ability to expand the number of alliances with hospitals and maintain current alliances, many of which are terminable on short notice, could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. a failure to integrate newly acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the successful integration of any business that the company may acquire entails numerous risks, including, among others: loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of companies or businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects to result from such integration, including projected cost savings. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. 28 index an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. a significant increase in the company's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing more billing to patients as a result of the growth in billings to managed care fee-for-service plans which have patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles and an increase in high deductible health plans. with these high deductible health plans, the patient is responsible for more payments prior to insurance covering the cost of care. a material change in the company's days sales outstanding level ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company's bad debt expense and dso could have an adverse effect on the company's business. failure in the company's information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations. the company's laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. the company's operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, blizzards and floods, or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories or to receive material from its suppliers. 29 index reimbursement for services may be adversely impacted due to the failure of the company or covered health plans to satisfy hipaa standard transaction and code set requirements, including npi. the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa have required the department of health and human services to establish national standards for electronic health care transactions and npi. cms requires the npi on part b professional claims after march 1, 2008. the failure of the company or third parties to meet the npi requirements for medicare claims or other covered health plans could have a material adverse impact on the company's reimbursement and profitability. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, the ongoing uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. changes in reimbursement by foreign governments and foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the united states. changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for the company's services and foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company's financial position or results of operations. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accouting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor's ratings services is bb- or lower. borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. the company's ontario, canada consolidated joint venture operates in canada and, accordingly, the earnings and cash flow generated from the ontario operation are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. the alberta, canada joint venture partnership operates in canada and remits the company's share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from this affiliate is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 24 risk factors risks associated with the company's business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of the company's business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payers may occur as well. uch changes in the past have resulted in reduced prices as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if it violates health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it meets all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain rec ords. the company cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect its business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. 24 failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company's laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and they utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employe rs, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. as a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company or the imposition 25 of penalties. failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with version 5010 transactions or the icd-10-cm code set could adversely impact the company's reimbursement. the company is within the assessment and inventory phase to adopt version 5010 transactions and to adopt the icd-10-cm code set issued by hhs on january 16, 2009. the compliance date for version 5010 is january 1, 2012; the compliance date for icd-10-cm code set is october 1, 2013. the company will continue its assessment of information systems, applications and processes for compliance with these requirements. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company's costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining ephi. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined b y hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. due to the recent enactment of hitech, it is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be; however, if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damage under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. 26 hitech may impose additional obligations on health care entities with respect to data privacy and security. the company is unable to predict the extent to which these new obligations may prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility 27 from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. health care reform changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms or new national or network managed care purchasing models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2010, requisitions (based on the total volume of requisitions excluding the ontario, canada joint venture) by payer were: private patients 1.9% medicare and medicaid 18.1%, commercial clients 31.1% and managed care 48.9%. mcos have different contracting philosophies. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and negotiate fees charged by such laboratories. other mcos allow any willing provider to be contracted at specified rates. the majority of the company's managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service basis at a discount from its patient prices. such discounts have historically resulted in price erosion and have negatively impacted the company's operating margins. in addition, mcos have used capitated payment contracts in an attempt to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated payment contract, the clinical laboratory and mco agree to a per member, per month payment to cover all laboratory tests during the month, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. such contracts shift the risk of increased test utilization to the clinical laboratory. for the year ended december 31, 2010, capitated contracts accounted for approximately $155.1 million, or 3.1%, of the company's net sales. a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. as patient cost-sharing increases, collectibility may be impacted. recently, certain managed care companies have adopted or expressed interest in adopting new national or laboratory network purchasing models. if the company is unable to participate in these new models, or if the company loses a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans has increased. implementation of the aca, the health care reform legislation passed last year, also may affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative r equirements. 28 the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. as an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the uncertainty of the evolving legislation, lack of clarity on the status of reforms, and limited release of regulations to guide compliance, the exact impact to employers including the company is uncertain. a failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, the company relies on developing alliances with hospitals to expand its business through appropriate collaborative agreements. the company's ability to expand the number of alliances with hospitals and maintain current alliances, many of which are terminable on short notice, could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. the company may fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth expected from the acquisition of genzyme genetics, which could adversely affect its operating results and the market price of its common stock. the success of the acquisition of genzyme genetics will depend, in significant part, on the company's ability to successfully integrate the acquired business and realize the anticipated benefits to be derived from incorporating genzyme genetics into its operations. the company believes that the acquisition will provide an opportunity for revenue growth in the areas of esoteric testing and personalized medicine. actual revenue growth, if achieved at all, may be lower than the company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. if the company is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. the integration of the acquired assets of genzyme genetics will be complex and involve a number of risks, and failure to successfully integrate the respective operations could significantly harm the company's business and results of operations. because of the structure of the transaction, as an asset carve out from genzyme corporation, the company will not be integrating a stand-alone enterprise with the back-office systems and processes to support the operation of the business. the company is currently relying upon genzyme corporation to provide critical business support services for a transition period and will ultimately have to transfer these activities to internal or third party resources and/or acquire new resources and increase its organizational capacity. relying upon genzyme corporation to perform critical operations and services during this transition period raises a number of significant business and operational risks and there is no assurance that the transition services provided by genzyme corporation will be efficient or effective. as a result, integrating the operations of genzyme genetics will be complex and there is no assurance that the company will not encounter material delays or unanticipated costs that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. successful integration involves numerous risks, including: 29 maintaining and transitioning relationships with key payers and other customers; retaining and attracting customers following a period of significant uncertainty associated with the acquired business; diversion of management attention from business and operational matters; integrating accounting, information technology, enterprise management and administrative systems which may be difficult or costly; making significant cash expenditures that may be required to retain personnel or eliminate unnecessary resources; and maintaining uniform standards, procedures and policies to ensure efficient and compliant administration of the organization. the company could also encounter unanticipated or additional integration-related costs or fail to realize all of the benefits of the acquisition that are included in the company's financial model and that drive expectations for future growth and profitability. a failure to integrate newly acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the successful integration of any business that the company may acquire entails numerous risks, including, among others: issues related to revenue recognition and/or cash collections; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of companies or businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects to result from such integration, including projected cost savings. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. 30 an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. a significant increase in the company's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing more billing to patients as a result of the growth in billings to managed care fee-for-service plans which have patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles and an increase in high deductible health plans. with these high deductible health plans, the patient is responsible for more payments prior to insurance covering the cost of care. a material change in the company's days sales outstanding level ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company's bad debt expense and dso co uld have an adverse effect on the company's business. failure in the company's information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations. the company's laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. the company's operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, blizzards and floods, or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. 31 reimbursement for services may be adversely impacted due to the failure of the company or covered health plans to satisfy hipaa standard transaction and code set requirements, including npi. the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa have required the department of health and human services to establish national standards for electronic health care transactions and npi. cms requires the npi on part b professional claims after march 1, 2008. the failure of the company or third parties to meet the npi requirements for medicare claims or other covered health plans could have a material adverse impact on the company's reimbursement and profitability. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. changes in reimbursement by foreign governments and foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the united states. changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for the company's services and foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company's financial position or results of operations. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor's ratings services is bb- or lower. borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. the company's ontario, canada consolidated joint venture operates in canada and, accordingly, the earnings and cash flow generated from the ontario operation are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. the alberta, canada joint venture partnership operates in canada and remits the company's share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from this affiliate is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 21 risk factors risks associated with the company's business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of the company's business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced prices as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if it violates health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company's failure to 21 index meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it meets all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company's laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and they utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. as a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net 22 index revenues. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company or the imposition of penalties. failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with version 5010 transactions by the cms delayed enforcement date of march 31, 2012 or to comply with the icd-10-cm code set by the compliance date to be determined by the department of health and human services which will be sometime after october 1, 2013, could negatively impact the company's reimbursement and profitability. the company is within the testing and validation of phase of version 5010 transactions and is moving to adopt the icd-10-cm code set issued by hhs on january 16, 2009. the compliance date for version 5010 is january 1, 2012 although cms announced an enforcement delay until march 31, 2012. the compliance date for icd-10-cm code set is october 1, 2013, but on february 16, 2012, hhs announced that it will postpone compliance to a date not yet specified. the company will continue its assessment of information systems, applications and processes for compliance with these requirements. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa have required the department of health and human services to establish national standards for electronic health care transactions and npi. cms requires the npi on part b professional claims after march 1, 2008. the failure of the company or third parties to meet the npi requirements for medicare claims or other covered health plans could have a material adverse impact on the company's reimbursement and profitability. compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company's costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining ephi. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined 23 index in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. due to the enactment of hitech, it is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be; however, if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. hitech may impose additional obligations on health care entities with respect to data privacy and security. the company is unable to predict the extent to which these new obligations may prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by 24 index physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. health care reform, changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms or new national or network managed care purchasing models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2011, requisitions (based on the total volume of requisitions excluding the ontario, canada joint venture) by payer were: private patients 1.7% medicare and medicaid 17.6% commercial clients 31.1% managed care 49.6%. mcos have different contracting philosophies. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and negotiate fees charged by such laboratories. other mcos allow any willing provider to be contracted at specified rates. the majority of the company's managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service basis at a discount from its patient prices. such discounts have historically resulted in price erosion and have negatively impacted the company's operating margins. in addition, mcos have used capitated payment contracts in an attempt to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated payment contract, the clinical laboratory and mco agree to a per member, per month payment to cover all laboratory tests during the month, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. such contracts shift the risk of increased test utilization to the clinical laboratory. for the year ended december 31, 2011, capitated contracts accounted for approximately $163.4 million, or 2.9%, of the company's net sales. a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. as patient cost-sharing increases, collectibility may be impacted. recently, certain managed care companies have adopted or expressed interest in adopting new national or laboratory network purchasing models. if the company is unable to participate in these new models, or if the company loses a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in medicaid managed care plans has also increased. implementation of the aca, the health care reform legislation passed last year, also may affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. as an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the uncertainty of the evolving legislation, lack of clarity on the status of reforms, and limited release of regulations to guide compliance, the exact impact to employers including the company is uncertain. 25 index a failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, the company relies on developing alliances with hospitals to expand its business through appropriate collaborative agreements. the company's ability to expand the number of alliances with hospitals and maintain current alliances, many of which are terminable on short notice, could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. the integration of the acquired assets of genzyme genetics will be complex and involve a number of risks, and failure to successfully integrate the respective operations could significantly harm the company's business and results of operations. integrating the operations of genzyme genetics will be complex and there is no assurance that the company will not encounter material delays or unanticipated costs that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. successful integration involves numerous risks, including: maintaining and transitioning relationships with key payers and other customers; retaining and attracting customers following a period of significant uncertainty associated with the acquired business; diversion of management attention from business and operational matters; integrating information technology, enterprise management and administrative systems which may be difficult or costly; making significant cash expenditures that may be required to retain personnel or eliminate unnecessary resources; and maintaining uniform standards, procedures and policies to ensure efficient and compliant administration of the organization. the company could also encounter unanticipated or additional integration-related costs or fail to realize all of the benefits of the acquisition that are included in the company's financial model and that drive expectations for future growth and profitability. a failure to integrate newly acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the successful integration of any business that the company may acquire entails numerous risks, including, among others: issues related to revenue recognition and/or cash collections; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of companies or businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects to result from such integration, including projected cost savings. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies 26 index and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. a significant increase in the company's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing more billing to patients as a result of the growth in billings to managed care fee-for-service plans which have patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles and an increase in high deductible health plans. with these high deductible health plans, the patient is responsible for more payments prior to insurance covering the cost of care. a material increase in the company's days sales outstanding level ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company's bad debt expense could have an adverse effect on the company's business. failure in the company's information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations. the company's laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or labor unrest or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. changes in reimbursement by foreign governments and foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the united states. changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for the company's services and foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. 27 index the company's growing international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the expansion of the company's international operations exposes it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the united states. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including export controls and trade regulations, changes in tax policies or other foreign laws, restrictions on currency repatriation, judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights, countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company's financial position or results of operations. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor's ratings services is bb- or lower. borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. the company's ontario, canada consolidated joint venture operates in canada and, accordingly, the earnings and cash flows generated from the ontario operations are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, orchid, has operations in the united kingdom and, accordingly the earnings and cash flows generated from orchid's united kingdom operation are subject to foreign currency risk. 50 index the alberta, canada joint venture partnership operates in canada and remits the company's share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from this affiliate is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 23 risk factors risks associated with the company's business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of the company's business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if it violates health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it meets all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988, the fda or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the fda regulates diagnostic products and periodically inspects and reviews their manufacturing 23 index processes and product performance. the company's medtox diagnostics' point of collection testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, or product suspensions or recalls which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company's laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and they utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. as a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company or the imposition of penalties. 24 index failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards or to comply with the icd-10-cm code set by the compliance date of october 1, 2014, could negatively impact the company's reimbursement, profitability and cash flow. the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current transactions and code sets rule. the company implemented version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards, and is within the remediation and implementation phase of the rule to adopt the icd-10-cm code set. the compliance date for version 5010 was january 1, 2012 but cms delayed enforcement until june 30, 2012. the compliance date for icd-10-cm is october 1, 2014. the company will continue its assessment and remediation of computer systems, applications and processes for compliance with these requirements. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa have required the department of health and human services to establish national standards for electronic health care transactions and npi. cms requires the npi on part b professional claims after march 1, 2008. the failure of the company or third parties to meet the npi requirements for medicare claims or other covered health plans could have a material adverse impact on the company's reimbursement and profitability. compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company's costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining ephi. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. due to the enactment of hitech, it is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be; however, if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. hitech may impose additional obligations on health care entities with respect to data privacy and security. the company is unable to predict the extent to which these new obligations may prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. 25 index increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. 26 index health care reform and related products (e.g. health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2012, requisitions (based on the total volume of requisitions excluding the ontario, canada joint venture) by payer were: private patients 1.6% medicare and medicaid 16.2% commercial clients 32.8% managed care 49.4%. the various managed care organizations ( mcos ) have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of the products they offer to their members. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of the rates reimbursed to participating laboratories. other mcos adopt broader networks with a largely uniform fee structure offered to all participating clinical laboratories. in addition, some mcos have used capitation in an effort to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement mechanism, the clinical laboratory and the managed care organization agree to a per member, per month payment to pay for all authorized laboratory tests ordered during the month by the physician for the members, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the clinical laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to ensure that its services are adequately compensated in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2012, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $168.1 million, or 3.0%, of the company's net sales. the company's ability to attract and retain managed care clients is critical given the impact of health care reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g. health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving delivery models (e.g. accountable care organizations). a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. as patient cost-sharing increases, collectibility may be impacted. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in medicaid managed care plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase. implementation of the aca, the health care reform legislation passed in 2010, also may affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. as an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, the exact impact to employers including the company is uncertain. 27 index a failure to obtain and retain new customers, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. the company has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. the company's inability to retain its existing relationships with those provider systems and networks and to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities, grow esoteric testing capabilities and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2008, the company has invested approximately $2.2 billion in strategic business acquisitions for these purposes. however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and bodies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities or billing and pricing arrangements that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research 28 index professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or its potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns by the affected workers. if unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse impact upon the company's business. a significant increase in the company's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing increasing patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans which continue to increase patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. a material increase in the company's days sales outstanding level ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company's bad debt expense could have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of the company's labcorp beacon platform could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's laboratory operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. the company is also continuing to enhance its labcorp beacon platform and could experience delays or deficiencies in the development process. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. 29 index changes in reimbursement by foreign governments and foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the united states. changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for the company's services and foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company's growing international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the expansion of the company's international operations exposes it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the united states. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including export controls and trade regulations, changes in tax policies or other foreign laws, restrictions on currency repatriation, judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights, countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company's financial position or results of operations. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor's ratings services is bb- or lower. borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. the company's ontario, canada consolidated joint venture operates in canada and, accordingly, the earnings and cash flows generated from the ontario operations are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, clearstone central laboratories, has operations in china and singapore, and, accordingly the earnings and cash flows generated from these operations are subject to foreign currency risk. 52 index the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, orchid, has operations in the united kingdom and, accordingly the earnings and cash flows generated from orchid's united kingdom operation are subject to foreign currency risk. the alberta, canada joint venture partnership operates in canada and remits the company's share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from this affiliate is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 24 risk factors risks associated with the company's business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare and medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of the company's business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if it violates health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it meets all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988, the fda or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the fda regulates diagnostic products and periodically inspects and reviews their manufacturing processes and product performance. the company's medtox diagnostic's point of collection testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. 24 index applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, or product suspensions or recalls which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company's laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and they utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the costs associated with icd-10-cm code set were substantial, and failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. as a result of inconsistent application of other transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company or the imposition of penalties. failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with the icd-10-cm code set by the compliance date of october 1, 2014, could negatively impact the company's reimbursement, profitability and cash flow. 25 index the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current transactions and code sets rule. the company implemented version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards, and is within the testing and implementation phase of the rule to adopt the icd-10-cm code set. the compliance date for icd-10-cm is october 1, 2014. the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the operating rules for electronic funds transfers and remittance advice transactions, for which the compliance date was january 1, 2014. the company will continue its assessment and remediation of computer systems, applications and processes for compliance with these requirements. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company's costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information as well as a new right of access to laboratory test reports under the hipaa privacy rule which preempts a number of state laws that prohibit a laboratory from releasing a test report directly to the individual, for which compliance will be required by october 4, 2014; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining ephi. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. due to the enactment of hitech, it is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be; however, if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also 26 index face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. health care reform and related products (e.g. health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, managed care organizations ("mcos") and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2013, requisitions (based on the total volume of requisitions excluding the company's other segment) by payer were: private patients 1.7% medicare and medicaid 15.1% commercial clients 34.5% managed care 48.7% the various mcos have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of the products they offer to their members. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of the rates reimbursed to participating laboratories. other mcos adopt broader networks with a generally largely uniform fee structure for participating clinical laboratories. in addition, some mcos have used capitation in an effort to fix the cost of laboratory testing 27 index services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement mechanism, the clinical laboratory and the managed care organization agree to a per member, per month payment to pay for all authorized laboratory tests ordered during the month by the physician for the members, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the clinical laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to ensure that its services are adequately compensated in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2013, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $187.3 million, or 3.2%, of the company's net sales. the company's ability to attract and retain managed care clients is critical given the impact of health care reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g. health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving delivery models (e.g. accountable care organizations). a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. as patient cost-sharing increases, collectibility may be impacted. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in medicaid managed care plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase. implementation of the aca, the health care reform legislation passed in 2010, also may affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements. the company has experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers have still not priced key molecular codes and a number of these payers, mostly government entities, have indicated that they will no longer pay for tests that they have previously covered. further, several payers are requiring additional information to process claims or have implemented prior authorization policies. many payers were delayed in understanding the impact of their claim edits, which impeded access to services that were previously covered and reimbursed. these delays and decisions had a negative impact on the company's 2013 financial performance and, if not favorably resolved, will have a negative impact on the company's future revenue, revenue per requisition, margins and cash flows until resolved. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. as an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, the exact impact to employers including the company is uncertain. a failure to obtain and retain new customers, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. the company has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. the company's inability to retain its existing relationships with those provider systems and networks and to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. 28 index a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities, grow esoteric testing capabilities and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2008, the company has invested approximately $2.4 billion in strategic business acquisitions for these purposes. however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities or billing and pricing arrangements that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or its potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns by the affected workers. if unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse impact upon the company's business. 29 index a significant increase in the company's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing increasing patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans which continue to increase patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. a material increase in the company's days sales outstanding level ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company's bad debt expense could have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of the company's labcorp beacon platform could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's laboratory operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. the company is also continuing to enhance its labcorp beacon platform and could experience delays or deficiencies in the development process. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. changes in reimbursement by foreign governments and foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s. changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for the company's services and foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company's growing international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the expansion of the company's international operations exposes it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including export controls and trade regulations, changes in tax policies or other foreign laws, restrictions on currency repatriation, judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights, countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. 30 index quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company's financial position or results of operations. during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for the 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month libor plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long term debt. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor's ratings services is bb- or lower. borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. 54 index the company's ontario, canada consolidated joint venture operates in canada and, accordingly, the earnings and cash flows generated from the ontario operations are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, clearstone central laboratories, has operations in china and singapore, and, accordingly the earnings and cash flows generated from these operations are subject to foreign currency risk. the company's wholly-owned subsidiary, orchid, has operations in the united kingdom and, accordingly the earnings and cash flows generated from orchid's united kingdom operation are subject to foreign currency risk. the alberta, canada joint venture partnership operates in canada and remits the company's share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from this affiliate is subject to foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 29 risk factors risks associated with the company's business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare and medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of the company's business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on the company's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if it violates health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it is in material compliance 29 index with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988, the fda or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the fda regulates diagnostic products and periodically inspects and reviews their manufacturing processes and product performance. the company's medtox diagnostic inc.'s point of collection testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, or product suspensions or recalls which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly, including fda regulation of laboratory developed tests. failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company's laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and they utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company include in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. 30 index the costs associated with icd-10-cm code set were substantial, and failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. as a result of inconsistent application of other transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company or the imposition of penalties. failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with the icd-10-cm code set by the compliance date of october 1, 2015, could negatively impact the company's reimbursement, profitability and cash flow. the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current transactions and code sets rule. the company implemented version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards, and is within the testing and implementation phase of the rule to adopt the icd-10-cm code set. the compliance date for icd-10-cm is october 1, 2015. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit health care claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to transition within the required timeframe could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company's costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information by health plans, health care providers and health care clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of protected health information. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its health care operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information; and the protection of computing systems maintaining ephi. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for health care data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or health care operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. due to the enactment of hitech, it is not possible to predict what the extent of the impact on business will be; however, if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, other federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur 31 index damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other health care providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. health care reform and related products (e.g. health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, managed care organizations ("mcos") and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse 32 index impact on the company's net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2014, requisitions (based on the total volume of requisitions excluding the company's other segment) by payer were: private patients 1.3% medicare and medicaid 14.4% commercial clients 34.6% managed care 49.7% the various mcos have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of the products they offer to their members. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of the rates reimbursed to participating laboratories. other mcos adopt broader networks with a generally largely uniform fee structure for participating clinical laboratories. in addition, some mcos have used capitation in an effort to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement mechanism, the clinical laboratory and the managed care organization agree to a per member, per month payment to pay for all authorized laboratory tests ordered during the month by the physician for the members, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the clinical laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to ensure that its services are adequately compensated in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2014, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $211.1 million, or 3.7%, of the company's net sales. the company's ability to attract and retain managed care clients is critical given the impact of health care reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g. health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving delivery models (e.g. accountable care organizations). a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. as patient cost-sharing increases, collectibility may be impacted. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in medicaid managed care plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase. implementation of the aca, the health care reform legislation passed in 2010, also may affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements. the company also experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers required an extended period of time to price key molecular codes and a number of those payers, mostly government entities, indicated that they would no longer pay for tests that they had previously covered. further, several payers are requiring additional information to process claims or have implemented prior authorization policies. many commercial payers were delayed in becoming aware of the impact of their claim edits and policies which impeded access to services which previously have been covered and reimbursed. these delays had a negative impact on 2014 revenue, revenue per requisition, margins and cash flows and are expected to have a continuing negative impact. similarly, coding changes related to toxicology and other procedures are being implemented in 2015 and palmetto has published a revised drugs of abuse local coverage policy which, if implemented as written, would adversely impact the company's medicare revenue. the policy has been delayed several times. it is currently published to be effective april 1, 2015 and it is not clear what policies medicaid and managed care organizations may implement in response. the company expects delays in the pricing and implementation of the new toxicology codes and it is unclear what impact will be experienced related to price and margins. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. as an employer, health care reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing health care coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, the exact impact to employers including the company is uncertain. 33 index a failure to obtain and retain new customers, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, as the broader health care industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. the company has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. the company's inability to retain its existing relationships with those provider systems and networks and to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities, grow esoteric testing capabilities and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2009, the company has invested approximately $7.9 billion in strategic business acquisitions for these purposes. however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities or billing and pricing arrangements that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. 34 index in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, or work stoppages could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or its potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, or other slowdowns by the affected workers. if unionized workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse impact upon the company's business. a significant increase in the company's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, the company is experiencing increasing patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans which continue to increase patient copayments, coinsurance and deductibles. a material increase in the company's days sales outstanding level ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company's bad debt expense could have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of the company's labcorp beacon platform could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's laboratory operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. the company is also continuing to enhance its labcorp beacon platform and could experience delays or deficiencies in the development process. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as adverse weather and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. 35 index hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement system enhancements or cyber security breaches may harm the company. the company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. a failure of the network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. while certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, there currently are not redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide it capacity in the event of a system failure. despite any precautions the company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at our various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to clients. in addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. in the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to clients. additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the company's reputation and harm the business. finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which the company has offices) and cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect the business. although the company carries property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur. changes in reimbursement by foreign governments and foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s. changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for the company's services and foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company's growing international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the expansion of the company's international operations exposes it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including export controls and trade regulations, changes in tax policies or other foreign laws, restrictions on currency repatriation, judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights, countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. risks associated with company's acquisition of covance in order to fund the covance acquisition, the company has materially reduced its cash balance and has taken on substantial additional indebtedness. the company completed the acquisition of covance on february 19, 2015 (the "acquisition"). to fund the consideration to be paid to covance stockholders pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the company used approximately $4.3 billion in cash and issued approximately 15.3 shares of the company's common stock. on november 2, 2014, in connection with entering into the merger agreement with covance, the company entered into a bridge facility commitment letter. under the bridge facility commitment letter, the lenders agreed to provide a $4.25 billion senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility consisting of $3.85 billion 364-day unsecured bridge tranche and a $400.0 million 60-day unsecured cash bridge tranche for the purpose of financing all or a portion of the cash consideration and the fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. on december 19, 2014, the company entered into a five-year term loan credit facility in the principal amount of $1.0 billion for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration and the fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. pursuant to the bridge facility commitment letter, upon the company's entry into the term loan credit facility, the $4.25 billion bridge facility was reduced to a $3.25 billion commitment, comprising a $2.85 billion 364-day unsecured debt bridge tranche and a $400.0 million 60-day cash bridge tranche. the $1.0 billion of term loan commitments made under the term loan credit facility reduced the debt bridge tranche under the bridge facility dollar for 36 index dollar. the term loan credit facility was advanced in full on february 19, 2015, the date of the company's completion of the acquisition. on january 30, 2015, the company issued $2.9 billion in debt securities, consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.625% senior notes due 2020, $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.20% senior notes due 2022, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.60% senior notes due 2025 and $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.700% senior notes due 2045 (together, the acquisition notes ). net proceeds from the offering of the acquisition notes were $2,868.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses of the offering. net proceeds were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration and the fees and expenses in connection with the company's acquisition of covance. pursuant to the bridge facility commitment letter, upon the company's issuance of the acquisition notes the remaining $2.85 billion 364-day unsecured debt bridge tranche under the senior unsecured bridge term loan credit facility was terminated. on february 13, 2015, the company entered into a 60-day cash bridge term loan credit facility in the principal amount of $400.0 million for the purpose of financing a portion of the cash consideration and the fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. the 60-day cash bridge term loan credit facility was entered into on the terms set forth in the bridge facility commitment letter for the $400.0 million 60-day cash bridge tranche. the 60-day cash bridge term loan credit facility was advanced in full on february 19, 2015, the date of the company's completion of the acquisition. the company's lower cash balance and increased indebtedness resulting from the acquisition financing could adversely affect its business. in particular, it could increase the company's vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. it may be difficult to integrate the business of covance into the company's current business and the company may fail to realize the anticipated revenue growth expected from the transaction, which could adversely affect its operating results and the market price of its common stock. if the company experiences greater than anticipated costs to integrate covance drug development into its existing operations or is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, its business and results of operations could be negatively affected. in addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of the company's ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the company's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources. these integration matters may have an adverse effect on the company, particularly during any transition period. in addition, although covance drug development is subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that the company faces in its business, the acquisition of covance also involves the company entering new product and services areas, markets and industries, which presents risks resulting from the company's relative inexperience in these new areas. covance business's laboratory testing business could react differently to economic and other external factors than the company's. the company faces the risk that it will not be successful with these new products and services or in these new markets. the success of the transaction will depend, in significant part, on the company's ability to successfully integrate the acquired business and realize the anticipated benefits to be derived from incorporating covance drug development into its operations. the company believes that the acquisition will provide an opportunity for revenue growth in development and commercialization of drugs and diagnostics, nutritional analysis and other areas, including a number of new business areas for the company. actual revenue growth, if any, may be lower than the company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated, and expenses may be higher than the company expects. if the company is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. the company has made certain assumptions relating to the covance acquisition that may prove to be materially inaccurate. the company has made certain assumptions relating to the covance acquisition that may prove to be materially inaccurate, including as a result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, a longer acquisition and transition process than expected, higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities, or general economic and business conditions that could adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. these assumptions relate to numerous matters, including: the company's assessments of the asset quality and value of covance and its assets; projections of the business and covance drug development's future financial performance; 37 index the company's ability to realize synergies and the timeline for doing so; acquisition costs, including restructuring charges and transaction costs; the company's ability to develop, maintain and deepen relationships with covance drug development's customers; and other financial and strategic risks of the acquisition. if one or more of these assumptions are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and operating results, and the expected benefits from the acquisition may not be realized. the company incurred significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the acquisition. the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the acquisition. these costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems consolidation costs, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including payments that may be made to certain covance business' executives, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. there are also a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that the company intends to integrate in connection with the acquisition and the integration of the two companies' businesses. while the company has assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred in connection with the acquisition and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, there are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total cost or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses. there may also be additional and significant unanticipated costs in connection with the acquisition that the company may not be able to recoup. these costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies, strategic benefits and additional income the company expects to achieve from the acquisition. although the company believes that these expected benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, a net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. the acquisition may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to the company's earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of the company's common stock. because shares of the company's common stock were issued in the acquisition, it is possible that the acquisition will be dilutive to the company's earnings per share, which could negatively affect the market price of shares of the company's common stock. in addition, future events and conditions could increase the dilution of the company's earnings as determined under generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap") that is currently projected, including adverse changes in market conditions, additional transaction and integration-related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. any dilution of, or delay of any accretion to, the company's earnings per share, should cause the price of shares of the company's common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate. covance drug development is subject to uncertainties related to the acquisition that could adversely affect its financial results and ability to retain key employees. uncertainty about the effect of the acquisition on covance drug development's customers, employees or suppliers may have an adverse effect on covance. although covance drug development has taken steps to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair its ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause disruptions in its relationships with customers, suppliers and other parties with which it deals. in particular, the company considers covance drug development's strong management team an attractive aspect of covance. the loss of members of covance drug development's senior management team could have an adverse effect on the company's ability to operate covance drug development and integrate it into the company's consolidated operations. retention of these key members may be particularly challenging prior to and even for a period after the completion of the acquisition, as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. if, despite retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with covance drug development, its business operations and financial results could be adversely affected. the company also expects that matters relating to the acquisition and integration-related issues will place a significant burden on the company's and covance drug development's management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities and improvements. 38 index changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for certain services that covance drug development provides. following the company's acquisition of covance, a portion of its business involves assisting pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies navigate the regulatory drug approval process. changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that covance drug development has difficulty satisfying or that make its service less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for its services. also, if government efforts to contain drug costs impact pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs, some of covance drug development's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on research and development. if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, some of covance drug development's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on research and development. covance drug development's revenues depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. covance drug development's revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in research and development. in some instances, companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects. accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect covance drug development's clients in these industries also affect covance drug development. if companies in these industries were to reduce the number of research and development projects they conduct or outsource, whether through inability to raise capital, industry trends, economic conditions or otherwise, covance drug development could be materially adversely affected. covance drug development may bear financial losses because many of its contracts are of a fixed price nature and may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond its control. many of covance drug development's contracts provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, including: the failure of products to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired results of the products; insufficient patient enrollment; insufficient investigator recruitment; the client's decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study; and covance drug development's failure to perform properly its duties under the contract. the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss, delay or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect covance drug development, although its contracts often entitle it to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned up to the time of termination. covance drug development operates in a highly competitive industry. competitors in the contract research organization industry range from small, limited-service providers to full service global contract research organizations. covance drug development's main competition consists of in-house departments of pharmaceutical companies, full-service and functional contract research organizations, and, to a lesser degree, universities and teaching hospitals. covance drug development competes on a variety of factors, including: reputation for on-time quality performance and regulatory compliance; expertise and experience in specific areas; scope of service offerings; strengths in various geographic markets; price; technological expertise and efficient drug development processes; quality of facilities; ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in an accurate manner; ability to manage large-scale clinical trials both domestically and internationally; expertise and experience in market access services; and size. for instance, certain of covance drug development's services have from time-to-time experienced periods of increased price competition which had an adverse effect on a segment's profitability and consolidated net revenues and net income. there is competition among contract research organizations for both clients and potential acquisition candidates. additionally, entities considering entering the contract research organization industry will find few barriers to entry, thus further increasing 39 index possible competition. these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of covance drug development's services and could adversely affect its financial results and the financial results of the company. contract research services create a risk of liability. in contracting to work on drug development trials and studies, covance drug development faces a range of potential liabilities, including: errors or omissions that create harm during a trial to study volunteers or after trial to consumers of drug after regulatory approval of the drug; general risks associated with clinical pharmacology facilities, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of clinical pharmacology medical care providers; errors or omissions from tests conducted for the agricultural, food, beverage and dietary supplement industries; risks that animals in covance drug development's breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in covance business policies, including those for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study or may delay the entry of a drug to the market. covance drug development also contracts with physicians, also referred to as investigators, to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on human volunteers. these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to volunteers, resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators. while covance drug development endeavors to include in its contracts provisions entitling it to be indemnified or entitling it to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not uniformly protect covance drug development against liability arising from certain of its own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. covance drug development could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify it does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or in the event that the damages and costs exceed covance drug development insurance coverage. there can be no assurance that covance drug development will be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage on terms acceptable to it. covance drug development revenues and earnings are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. covance drug development derives a large portion of its net revenues from international operations. since the company's consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on reported results. in addition, in certain circumstances, covance drug development may incur costs in one currency related to its services or products for which it is paid in a different currency. as a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect covance drug development's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. actions of animal rights extremists may affect business. early development services utilize animals in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs and also breed and sell animals for biomedical research. such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the united states, europe, japan and other countries. acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights extremists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have an adverse effect on the covance drug development business. animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage covance drug development's inventory, harm its reputation, result in decreased sales of research products or result in other liability. it is important that research products be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, can cause loss of animals in covance drug development's inventory, can result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or can result in other losses. such results could harm covance drug develpment's reputation or have an adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 67 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 67 index for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company's financial position or results of operations. during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for the 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month libor plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long term debt. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor's ratings services is bb- or lower. borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. the company has laboratory locations throughout the united states and other countries including, belgium, canada, china, japan, singapore, the united kingdom and the united arab emirates and, accordingly, the earnings and cash flows generated from these operations are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.risk factors 26 risk factors investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the company's securities. the risks below are not the only ones that the company faces. additional risks not presently known to the company, or that the company presently deems immaterial, may also negatively impact the company. the company's business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors. this report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. the company's results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere. see forward looking statements in item 7. changes in payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare and medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for pathology services performed by lcd is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on lcd's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon lcd's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if it violates healthcare anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the national, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988, or those of medicare, medicaid or other national, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the u.s. by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. 26 index fda regulation of diagnostic products and increased fda regulation of ldts could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the fda has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. the fda enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products and regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products. lcd's point-of-collection testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. on july 26, 2007, the fda issued draft guidance for industry, clinical laboratories, and fda staff: in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays . the guidance proposed certain changes to the agency's general past practice regarding the regulation of certain ldts and announced that most devices deemed to be in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays (ivdmias) would either be class ii or class iii devices, although it is possible that an ivdmia for a low-risk indication could be class i. class ii medical devices typically require fda clearance or a premarket notification submission. class iii devices require the submission of an application for premarket approval (pma). on october 3, 2014, the fda published two additional draft guidance documents: framework for regulatory oversight of laboratory developed tests (ldts) which provides an overview of how fda would regulate ldts through a risk-based approach and fda notification and medical device reporting for laboratory developed tests which describes the process for clinical laboratories to notify the fda of the ldts they "manufacture" and describes the medical device reporting (mdr) requirements for ldts. on may 28, 2015, and october 22, 2015, the house energy and commerce health subcommittee released discussion drafts of a bill that would reform oversight of in vitro clinical tests (ivcts), including both ldts and test kits, under a new regulatory framework in which fda would regulate ivcts under a new category separate from medical devices, and regulation of laboratories by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments (clia) would be modernized. on november 16, 2015, the fda issued a report titled, the public health evidence for fda oversight of laboratory developed tests: 20 case studies (ldt report). the ldt report compiles 20 case studies involving ldts where fda alleges that non-compliance with fda regulations led to serious issues, such as false positive or false-negative results, causing potential or actual harm to patients. on december 29, 2015, fda published notice of its intent to finalize guidance on its policy for regulatory oversight of ldts in 2016. the outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. current fda regulation of the company's diagnostic products and potential future increased regulation of the company's ldts could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. as previously discussed item 1 of part i of this report, the company is subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company that may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for healthcare services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. as a result of inconsistent application of other transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. the company is working closely 27 index with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company and the imposition of fines and penalties. failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with the icd-10-cm code set could negatively impact the company's reimbursement, profitability and cash flow. the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current transactions and code sets rule. the company implemented version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and believes it has fully adopted the icd-10-cm code set. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit healthcare claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to apply the new code set could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the company's reputation with customers and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of phi by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of phi. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of phi are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of phi; the content of notices of privacy practices for phi; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive phi; and the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic phi. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the hipaa privacy and security requirements as applicable. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both additional federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for data transfers from and operations in other countries, the company may also be required to comply with the data privacy and security laws of those other countries. hipaa restricts the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, foreign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of health information or other personal information and in europe both criminal and administrative sanctions are possible for violation of national implementations of the general data protection directive 95/46/ec. in december 2015, the eu enacted a general data protection regulation to replace directive 95/46/ec, which is expected to take effect at some point in 2018, and which has enhanced penalties for noncompliance. the company is evaluating its ability and the cost to comply with the new eu regulations, and as a result of that evaluation expects to make change to its business practices and incur additional costs. 28 index discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its r&amp;d costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. healthcare reform and related products (e.g., health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. lcd's testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person who ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and mcos could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. the various mcos have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of the products they offer to their members. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of the rates reimbursed to participating laboratories. other mcos adopt broader networks with a largely uniform fee structure for participating clinical laboratories; in some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. in addition, some mcos have used capitation in an effort to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the mco makes a per member, per month payment for all covered laboratory tests rendered during the month for the members, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the clinical laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to ensure that its services are adequately compensated in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2015, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $219.9 million, or 2.6%, of the company's net revenues. the company's ability to attract and retain mcos is critical given the impact of healthcare reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g., health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving delivery models (e.g., acos). 29 index a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. collectibility may be impacted as patient cost-sharing increases. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicare plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicaid plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase. implementation of the aca, the healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010, also may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements. the company also experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers required an extended period of time to price key molecular codes and a number of those payers, mostly government entities, indicated that they would no longer pay for tests that they had previously covered. further, several payers continue to require additional information to process claims or have implemented prior authorization policies. many commercial payers were delayed in becoming aware of the impact of their claim edits and policies, which impeded access to services that previously had been covered and reimbursed. these delays had a negative impact on 2014 revenue, revenue per requisition, margins and cash flows, which were largely sustained throughout 2015, and are expected to have a continuing negative impact. similarly, clfs coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedures were implemented in 2016 and palmetto implemented a drugs of abuse local coverage policy which impacted the handling of such procedures for medicaid and mcos. the company experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of the new toxicology codes, however, largely overcame issues related to price and margins through direct negotiation with the associated payers. further coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedure types are to be implemented in 2016. the company expects delays in the pricing and implementation of these new codes and it is unclear what impact will be experienced related to price and margins. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if lcd cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. in 2014, congress passed the pama, requiring medicare to change the way payment rates are calculated for tests paid under the clfs, and to base the payment on the weighted median of rates paid by private payers. on october 1, 2015, cms published a proposed rule to implement pama. this rule proposes to require applicable laboratories, including lcd, to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to cms during the first quarter of 2016, which cms would then use to calculate new clfs rates that would be effective in 2017. the american clinical laboratory association (acla) and the lab community provided extensive comments on the proposed rule and will continue to work with cms to arrive at final regulation that accurately reflects the statutory language on applicable laboratories, and results in a reimbursement framework that reflects the broad scope of the laboratory market, encourages innovation, and maintains access to laboratory services for medicare beneficiaries. the company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rule. as an employer, healthcare reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, the exact impact to employers including the company is uncertain. in addition, implementation of healthcare reform legislation that adds costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect r&amp;d expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to cdd both in the u.s. and other countries. new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase cdd costs or limit service offerings through cdd. changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for certain services that cdd provides. cdd assists pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in navigating the regulatory drug approval process. changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that cdd has difficulty satisfying or that make its services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for its services. also, if government efforts to contain drug costs impact pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs, some of cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, some of 30 index cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the u.s. fda and other drug regulatory agencies, such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the u.k., the european medicines agency, the china food and drug administration, and the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency in japan could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the operation of cdd's preclinical laboratory facilities and clinical trial operations must conform at all times to glp and gcp as well as all other applicable standards and regulations, respectively, as further described in "business" in item 1 of this report. additionally, certain cdd services and activities must conform to cgmp as further described in "business" in item 1 of this report. failure to maintain compliance with glp, gcp, or cgmp regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in warning letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against cdd, including suspension of its laboratory operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. both lcd and cdd operate in highly competitive industries. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by healthcare providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of significant consolidation in the clinical laboratory industry, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. lcd may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. competitors in the cro industry range from small providers to full service global cros. cdd's main competition consists of in-house departments of pharmaceutical companies, full-service and functional cros, and, to a lesser degree, universities and teaching hospitals. cdd competes on a variety of factors, including: reputation for on-time quality performance and regulatory compliance; expertise and experience in specific areas; scope of service offerings; strengths in various geographic markets; price; technological expertise and efficiency of drug development processes; quality of facilities; ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in a rapid and accurate manner; quality of relationships; ability to manage large-scale clinical trials both domestically and internationally; expertise and experience in market access services; and size and scale. cdd's services have from time to time experienced periods of increased price competition which had an adverse effect on a segment's profitability and consolidated net revenues and net income. there is competition among cros for both clients and potential acquisition candidates. additionally, entities considering entering the cro industry will find few barriers to entry, thus further increasing possible competition. these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of cdd's services and could adversely affect its financial results and the financial results of the company. a failure to obtain and retain new customers, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services and to otherwise maintain and grow its business, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered 31 index or specimens submitted by existing customers, a decrease in demand for the cdd's services from existing clients, or the loss of existing contracts, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of services, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community and the drug development industry, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. lcd has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. lcd's inability to retain its existing relationships with those provider systems and networks and to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. continued and increased consolidation of managed care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, health systems, physicians and other customers could adversely affect the company's business. many healthcare companies and providers, including mcos, pharmaceutical companies, health systems and physician practices are consolidating through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of transactions and collaborations. as the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services may become more intense. this competition and increased customer bargaining power may adversely affect the price and volume of the company's services. lcd's nutritional chemistry and food safety business exposes the company to various risks, including liability for errors and omissions in work conducted for lcd clients. lcd offers a range of product-development and product-integrity services to food and beverage manufacturers and retailers, industry organizations and academic institutions. lcd expects to expand its nutritional chemistry and food safety business by leveraging the company's expertise in microbiology and its infrastructure to enable testing to be performed close to the food source. lcd also is exploring the possibility of developing point of care testing for food safety. these business offerings and opportunities expose the company to many of the same, or similar, risks that are applicable to other business activities of the company, including with respect to the operations of its facilities and the application of applicable laws and regulations. the agricultural, food, beverage and dietary supplement industries are continuing to gain attention of governments and regulators around the world, and regulations and applicable laws have increased in recent years. for example, the company's customers will be subject to new nutrition labeling regulations and new food manufacturing requirements, including regulations issued under the food safety modernization act (fsma). with these enhanced requirements on the company's clients, there is an increased risk that errors in or omissions from nutritional analysis and food safety tests conducted by the company for its clients could result in liability for the company under client contracts. if lcd determines to further expand its nutritional chemistry and food safety testing business in the future beyond what is currently anticipated, lcd could become subject to additional standards and regulations, including under the fsma, and could face additional liabilities resulting from new and pending regulatory and other legal decisions. changes or disruption in services or supplies provided by third parties, including transportation, could adversely affect the company's business. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business. the company's laboratories and certain of the company's other businesses are heavily reliant on air travel for transport of clinical trial and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people, and a significant disruption to the air travel system, or the company's access to it, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. cdd depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain services and for certain animal populations. disruptions to the continued supply of these services, products or animal populations may arise from export/import restrictions or embargoes, political or economic instability, adverse weather, natural disaster or other causes. disruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. damage or disruption to the company's facilities could adversely affect the company's business. many of the company's facilities would be difficult to replace in a short period of time. any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities might impact the company's ability to provide service to customers and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 32 index the company bears financial risk for contracts that are underpriced, for which there are cost overruns or that may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond the company's control. the company has many contracts that are structured as fixed-price for fixed-contracted services or fee-for-service with a cap. the company bears the financial risk if these contracts are underpriced or if contract costs exceed estimates. such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. many of cdd's contracts, in particular, provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, including: the failure of products to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired results of the products; insufficient patient enrollment; insufficient investigator recruitment; the client's decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study; and cdd's failure to perform its duties properly under the contract. although its contracts often entitle it to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned up to the time of termination, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss, delay or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect cdd. contract research services in the drug development industry create liability risks. in contracting to work on drug development trials and studies, cdd faces a range of potential liabilities, including: errors or omissions that create harm to study volunteers during a trial or to consumers of a drug after the trial is completed and regulatory approval of the drug has been granted; general risks associated with clinical pharmacology facilities, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of clinical pharmacology medical care providers; risks that animals in cdd's breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in cdd's business policies, including those for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study or may delay the entry of a drug to the market. cdd also contracts with physicians, also referred to as investigators, to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on patients and volunteers. these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to volunteers, resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators. while cdd endeavors to include in its contracts provisions entitling it to be indemnified or entitling it to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not uniformly protect cdd against liability arising from certain of its own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. cdd could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify it does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or in the event that the damages and costs exceed cdd's insurance coverage. there can be no assurance that cdd will be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage on terms acceptable to it. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters. the company may also receive inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies, including medicare or medicaid carriers, requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities or billing and pricing arrangements that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. the company's quarterly operating results may vary. the company's operating results, particularly for cdd, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by factors over which the company has little control such as: changes in the general global economy; exchange rate fluctuations; the commencement, completion, delay or cancellation of large projects or groups of projects; the progress of ongoing projects; 33 index the timing of and charges associated with completed acquisitions or other events; and changes in the mix of the company's services. the company believes that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. while fluctuations in the company's quarterly operating results could negatively or positively affect the market price of the company's common stock, these fluctuations may not be related to the company's future overall operating performance. cdd's revenues depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. cdd's revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in r&amp;d. in some instances, companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their r&amp;d projects. accordingly, economic factors and industry trends affecting cdd's clients in these industries may also affect cdd. if companies in these industries were to reduce the number of r&amp;d projects they conduct or outsource, whether through inability to raise capital, industry trends, economic conditions or otherwise, cdd could be materially adversely affected. actions of animal rights activists may have an adverse effect on the company. cdd's early development services utilize animals in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs, and also breed and sell animals for biomedical research. such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the u.s., europe, japan and other countries. acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have an adverse effect on the company. animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage cdd's inventory, harm its reputation, result in decreased sales of research products or result in other liability. it is important that research products be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, cause loss of animals in cdd's inventory, result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or result in other losses. such results could harm cdd's reputation or have an adverse effect on cdd's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. failure to conduct animal research in compliance with the animal welfare act could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the conduct of animal research at cdd's facilities must be in compliance with the awa, which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals used for research in the u.s. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the usda. the awa establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care and recordkeeping. cdd complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the usda and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions such as the european union and china for the care and use of regulated species. if the usda determines that cdd's equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable awa standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. for continued noncompliance, the usda may impose fines, suspend and/or revoke animal research licenses, or confiscate research animals. other countries where cdd conducts business may have similar laws with which cdd must also comply. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and drug development facilities could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies and in drug development will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, work stoppages or failure to comply with labor or employment laws could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and is subject to employment and labor laws and unionization activity in the u.s. and other countries in which it conducts business. disputes with regard to the terms of 34 index these agreements, its potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalities. if any of these events were to occur, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, or changes in labor labor or employment laws, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse impact upon the company's business. a significant increase in lcd's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, lcd is experiencing increasing patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans which continue to increase deductibles, coinsurance and patient copayments. a material increase in lcd's days sales outstanding level could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially increasing its bad debt rate and decreasing its cash flows. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of the company's labcorp beacon platform could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's laboratory operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results or drug development data in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. the company is also continuing to enhance its labcorp beacon platform and could experience delays or deficiencies in the development process. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as adverse weather and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline of testing volumes in both segments. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's ability to register participants, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement system enhancements or cyber security breaches may harm the company. the company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. a failure of the network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. while certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, there currently are not redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide it capacity in the event of a system failure. despite any precautions the company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at the company's various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to clients. in addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. 35 index in the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to clients. additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the company's reputation and harm the business. finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which the company has offices) and cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect the business. although the company carries property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur. security breaches and unauthorized access to the company or its customers' data could harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business. experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the company's layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise personal information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the company's systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments, through illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. although the company believes that it has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the company may be unable to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the company's remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. breaches of the company's security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of personal information, proprietary or confidential information about the company or its customers or other third-parties, could expose customers' private information and could expose customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose the company or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for the company, damage the company's brand and reputation or otherwise harm the company's business. any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange fluctuations and changes in reimbursement by foreign governments could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s. and cdd derives a large portion of its net revenues from international operations. since the company's consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on reported results. in addition, in certain circumstances, cdd may incur costs in one currency related to its services or products for which it is paid in a different currency. as a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect cdd's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. foreign currency exchange fluctuations and changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for lcd's services could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company's growing international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the expansion of the company's international operations exposes it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including export controls and trade regulations, changes in tax policies or other foreign laws, foreign labor and employee relations laws and regulations, restrictions on currency repatriation, judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights, countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. 36 index a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities and enhance therapeutic expertise, enhance esoteric testing and global drug development capabilities and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2010, the company has invested net cash of approximately $5.8 billion and equity of $1.8 billion in strategic business acquisitions ($2.2 billion over the same period excluding the acquisition of covance). however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. the company's substantially increased indebtedness could adversely affect the company's liquidity, results of operations and business. at december 31, 2015, indebtedness on the company's outstanding senior notes totaled approximately $5,525.0 million in aggregate principal. the company is also a party to credit agreements relating to a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a term loan with a principal balance of $ 715.0 million as of december 31, 2015. under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment grade-rated borrowers, and the company is required to maintain a leverage ratio that declines over time. the company's increased indebtedness could adversely affect its business. in particular, it could increase the company's vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. the company may also enter into additional transactions or credit facilities, including other long-term debt, which may increase its indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon the business. in addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate the company's debt based on a number of factors. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets. failure to successfully integrate the business of covance or to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse impact on the company's business, net revenues and profitability and the market price of its common stock. if the company fails to successfully complete the integration of covance into its existing operations or is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and integration, its business and results of operations could be negatively affected. in addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of the company's ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, or disruptions in its relationships with suppliers and other parties with which it deals that could adversely affect the company's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. integration efforts could also place a significant burden on the company's management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities and improvements. the ongoing success of the transaction will depend, in significant part, on the company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, including the opportunity for revenue growth in development and commercialization of drugs and diagnostics, nutritional analysis and other areas, including a number of new business areas for the company. actual revenue growth may be 37 index lower than the company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated, and expenses may be higher than the company expects. the company has made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition and integration that may prove to be materially inaccurate, including: the company's assessments of the asset quality and value of covance and its assets; projections of the business and cdd's future financial performance; timing and total costs of integrating a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems; the company's ability to realize synergies and the timeline for doing so; the company's ability to develop, maintain and deepen relationships with cdd's customers; and other financial and strategic risks of the acquisition. if one or more of these assumptions are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and operating results, and the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. in addition, although cdd is subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that the company faces in its business, the acquisition of covance also involves the company entering new product and services areas, markets and industries, which presents risks resulting from the company's relative inexperience in these new areas. cdd's business could react differently to economic and other external factors than the company's. the company faces the risk that it will not be successful with these new products and services or in these new markets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 65 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. in the ordinary course of business, the company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the company regularly evaluates the exposure to such changes. the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign currency exchange rates approximately 17.7% of the company's net revenues for year ended december 31, 2015 and approximately 6.8% of those for year ended 2014 were denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company's financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into u.s. dollars for purposes of reporting the company's consolidated financial results. in 2015, the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the canadian dollar, swiss franc, euro and british pound. in 2014, the most significant currency exposure was to the canadian dollar. excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10% in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to u.s. dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2015 by approximately $9.6. gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity were $370.7 and $89.5 at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly-inflationary. the company earns revenue from service contracts over a period of several months and, in some cases, over a period of several years. accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect the company's profitability with respect to such contracts. the company is also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. the company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in some of its contracts with customers, or it may hedge transaction risk with foreign currency forward contracts. at december 31, 2015, the company had 4 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2016 with a notional value totaling approximately $93.1 million. at december 31, 2014, the company had no open foreign exchange forward contracts. interest rates some of the company's debt is subject to interest at variable rates. as a result, fluctuations in interest rates affect the business. the company attempts to manage interest rate risk and overall borrowing costs through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt including by the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. borrowings under the company's term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. as of december 31, 2015, the company had approximately $715.0 of unhedged variable rate debt from the term loan credit facility. as of december 31, 2014 the company had no outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility and no term loan facility. 65 index during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for the 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month libor plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long term debt. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by s&amp;p's ratings services is bb- or lower. each quarter-point increase or decrease in the variable rate would result in the company's interest expense changing by approximately $1.8 per year for the company's unhedged variable rate debt.risk factors 26 risk factors investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the company's securities. the risks below are not the only ones that the company faces. additional risks not presently known to the company, or that the company presently deems immaterial, may also negatively impact the company. the company's business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors. this report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. the company's results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere. see forward looking statements in item 7. changes in payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including mcos, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare and medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for pathology services performed by lcd is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on lcd's business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon lcd's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if it violates healthcare anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the national, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988, or those of medicare, medicaid or other national, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the u.s. by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. 26 index fda regulation of diagnostic products and increased fda regulation of ldts could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the fda has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. the fda enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products and regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products. lcd's point-of-collection testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. on july 26, 2007, the fda issued draft guidance for industry, clinical laboratories, and fda staff: in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays . the guidance proposed certain changes to the agency's general past practice regarding the regulation of certain ldts and announced that most devices deemed to be in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays (ivdmias) would either be class ii or class iii devices, although it is possible that an ivdmia for a low-risk indication could be class i. class ii medical devices typically require fda clearance or a premarket notification submission. class iii devices require the submission of an application for premarket approval (pma). on october 3, 2014, the fda published two additional draft guidance documents: framework for regulatory oversight of laboratory developed tests (ldts) which provides an overview of how fda would regulate ldts through a risk-based approach and fda notification and medical device reporting for laboratory developed tests which describes the process for clinical laboratories to notify the fda of the ldts they "manufacture" and describes the medical device reporting (mdr) requirements for ldts. on may 28, 2015, and october 22, 2015, the house energy and commerce health subcommittee released discussion drafts of a bill that would reform oversight of in vitro clinical tests (ivcts), including both ldts and test kits, under a new regulatory framework in which fda would regulate ivcts under a new category separate from medical devices, and regulation of laboratories by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments (clia) would be modernized. on november 16, 2015, the fda issued a report titled, the public health evidence for fda oversight of laboratory developed tests: 20 case studies (ldt report). the ldt report compiles 20 case studies involving ldts where fda alleges that non-compliance with fda regulations led to serious issues, such as false positive or false-negative results, causing potential or actual harm to patients. on december 29, 2015, fda published notice of its intent to finalize guidance on its policy for regulatory oversight of ldts in 2016. the outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. current fda regulation of the company's diagnostic products and potential future increased regulation of the company's ldts could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. as previously discussed item 1 of part i of this report, the company is subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company that may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for healthcare services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to the company by physicians. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, and the icd-10-cm code set, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. as a result of inconsistent application of other transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. the company is working closely 27 index with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and to become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company and the imposition of fines and penalties. failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to comply with the icd-10-cm code set could negatively impact the company's reimbursement, profitability and cash flow. the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current transactions and code sets rule. the company implemented version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and believes it has fully adopted the icd-10-cm code set. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit healthcare claims with diagnosis codes to third party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third party payers or physicians to apply the new code set could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the company's reputation with customers and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of phi by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of phi. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of phi are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of phi; the content of notices of privacy practices for phi; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive phi; and the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic phi. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the hipaa privacy and security requirements as applicable. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both additional federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, for data transfers from and operations in other countries, the company may also be required to comply with the data privacy and security laws of those other countries. hipaa restricts the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa, as amended by hitech, provides for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in addition, foreign, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of health information or other personal information and in europe both criminal and administrative sanctions are possible for violation of national implementations of the general data protection directive 95/46/ec. in december 2015, the eu enacted a general data protection regulation to replace directive 95/46/ec, which is expected to take effect at some point in 2018, and which has enhanced penalties for noncompliance. the company is evaluating its ability and the cost to comply with the new eu regulations, and as a result of that evaluation expects to make change to its business practices and incur additional costs. 28 index discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the clinical laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its r&amp;d costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. healthcare reform and related products (e.g., health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. lcd's testing services are billed to private patients, medicare, medicaid, commercial clients, mcos and other insurance companies. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person who ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and mcos could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. the various mcos have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of the products they offer to their members. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of the rates reimbursed to participating laboratories. other mcos adopt broader networks with a largely uniform fee structure for participating clinical laboratories; in some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. in addition, some mcos have used capitation in an effort to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the mco makes a per member, per month payment for all covered laboratory tests rendered during the month for the members, regardless of the number or cost of the tests actually performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the clinical laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to ensure that its services are adequately compensated in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2015, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $219.9 million, or 2.6%, of the company's net revenues. the company's ability to attract and retain mcos is critical given the impact of healthcare reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g., health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving delivery models (e.g., acos). 29 index a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues are collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. collectibility may be impacted as patient cost-sharing increases. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicare plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicaid plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase. implementation of the aca, the healthcare reform legislation passed in 2010, also may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements. the company also experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers required an extended period of time to price key molecular codes and a number of those payers, mostly government entities, indicated that they would no longer pay for tests that they had previously covered. further, several payers continue to require additional information to process claims or have implemented prior authorization policies. many commercial payers were delayed in becoming aware of the impact of their claim edits and policies, which impeded access to services that previously had been covered and reimbursed. these delays had a negative impact on 2014 revenue, revenue per requisition, margins and cash flows, which were largely sustained throughout 2015, and are expected to have a continuing negative impact. similarly, clfs coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedures were implemented in 2016 and palmetto implemented a drugs of abuse local coverage policy which impacted the handling of such procedures for medicaid and mcos. the company experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of the new toxicology codes, however, largely overcame issues related to price and margins through direct negotiation with the associated payers. further coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedure types are to be implemented in 2016. the company expects delays in the pricing and implementation of these new codes and it is unclear what impact will be experienced related to price and margins. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if lcd cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. in 2014, congress passed the pama, requiring medicare to change the way payment rates are calculated for tests paid under the clfs, and to base the payment on the weighted median of rates paid by private payers. on october 1, 2015, cms published a proposed rule to implement pama. this rule proposes to require applicable laboratories, including lcd, to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to cms during the first quarter of 2016, which cms would then use to calculate new clfs rates that would be effective in 2017. the american clinical laboratory association (acla) and the lab community provided extensive comments on the proposed rule and will continue to work with cms to arrive at final regulation that accurately reflects the statutory language on applicable laboratories, and results in a reimbursement framework that reflects the broad scope of the laboratory market, encourages innovation, and maintains access to laboratory services for medicare beneficiaries. the company is continuing to evaluate the potential impact of the proposed rule. as an employer, healthcare reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company to implement significant process and record keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, the exact impact to employers including the company is uncertain. in addition, implementation of healthcare reform legislation that adds costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect r&amp;d expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to cdd both in the u.s. and other countries. new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase cdd costs or limit service offerings through cdd. changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for certain services that cdd provides. cdd assists pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in navigating the regulatory drug approval process. changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that cdd has difficulty satisfying or that make its services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for its services. also, if government efforts to contain drug costs impact pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs, some of cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, some of 30 index cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the u.s. fda and other drug regulatory agencies, such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the u.k., the european medicines agency, the china food and drug administration, and the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency in japan could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the operation of cdd's preclinical laboratory facilities and clinical trial operations must conform at all times to glp and gcp as well as all other applicable standards and regulations, respectively, as further described in "business" in item 1 of this report. additionally, certain cdd services and activities must conform to cgmp as further described in "business" in item 1 of this report. failure to maintain compliance with glp, gcp, or cgmp regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in warning letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against cdd, including suspension of its laboratory operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. both lcd and cdd operate in highly competitive industries. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by healthcare providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of significant consolidation in the clinical laboratory industry, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. lcd may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. competitors in the cro industry range from small providers to full service global cros. cdd's main competition consists of in-house departments of pharmaceutical companies, full-service and functional cros, and, to a lesser degree, universities and teaching hospitals. cdd competes on a variety of factors, including: reputation for on-time quality performance and regulatory compliance; expertise and experience in specific areas; scope of service offerings; strengths in various geographic markets; price; technological expertise and efficiency of drug development processes; quality of facilities; ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in a rapid and accurate manner; quality of relationships; ability to manage large-scale clinical trials both domestically and internationally; expertise and experience in market access services; and size and scale. cdd's services have from time to time experienced periods of increased price competition which had an adverse effect on a segment's profitability and consolidated net revenues and net income. there is competition among cros for both clients and potential acquisition candidates. additionally, entities considering entering the cro industry will find few barriers to entry, thus further increasing possible competition. these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of cdd's services and could adversely affect its financial results and the financial results of the company. a failure to obtain and retain new customers, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services and to otherwise maintain and grow its business, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered 31 index or specimens submitted by existing customers, a decrease in demand for the cdd's services from existing clients, or the loss of existing contracts, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of services, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community and the drug development industry, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. lcd has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. lcd's inability to retain its existing relationships with those provider systems and networks and to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. continued and increased consolidation of managed care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, health systems, physicians and other customers could adversely affect the company's business. many healthcare companies and providers, including mcos, pharmaceutical companies, health systems and physician practices are consolidating through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of transactions and collaborations. as the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services may become more intense. this competition and increased customer bargaining power may adversely affect the price and volume of the company's services. lcd's nutritional chemistry and food safety business exposes the company to various risks, including liability for errors and omissions in work conducted for lcd clients. lcd offers a range of product-development and product-integrity services to food and beverage manufacturers and retailers, industry organizations and academic institutions. lcd expects to expand its nutritional chemistry and food safety business by leveraging the company's expertise in microbiology and its infrastructure to enable testing to be performed close to the food source. lcd also is exploring the possibility of developing point of care testing for food safety. these business offerings and opportunities expose the company to many of the same, or similar, risks that are applicable to other business activities of the company, including with respect to the operations of its facilities and the application of applicable laws and regulations. the agricultural, food, beverage and dietary supplement industries are continuing to gain attention of governments and regulators around the world, and regulations and applicable laws have increased in recent years. for example, the company's customers will be subject to new nutrition labeling regulations and new food manufacturing requirements, including regulations issued under the food safety modernization act (fsma). with these enhanced requirements on the company's clients, there is an increased risk that errors in or omissions from nutritional analysis and food safety tests conducted by the company for its clients could result in liability for the company under client contracts. if lcd determines to further expand its nutritional chemistry and food safety testing business in the future beyond what is currently anticipated, lcd could become subject to additional standards and regulations, including under the fsma, and could face additional liabilities resulting from new and pending regulatory and other legal decisions. changes or disruption in services or supplies provided by third parties, including transportation, could adversely affect the company's business. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business. the company's laboratories and certain of the company's other businesses are heavily reliant on air travel for transport of clinical trial and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people, and a significant disruption to the air travel system, or the company's access to it, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. cdd depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain services and for certain animal populations. disruptions to the continued supply of these services, products or animal populations may arise from export/import restrictions or embargoes, political or economic instability, adverse weather, natural disaster or other causes. disruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. damage or disruption to the company's facilities could adversely affect the company's business. many of the company's facilities would be difficult to replace in a short period of time. any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities might impact the company's ability to provide service to customers and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 32 index the company bears financial risk for contracts that are underpriced, for which there are cost overruns or that may be delayed or terminated or reduced in scope for reasons beyond the company's control. the company has many contracts that are structured as fixed-price for fixed-contracted services or fee-for-service with a cap. the company bears the financial risk if these contracts are underpriced or if contract costs exceed estimates. such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. many of cdd's contracts, in particular, provide for services on a fixed price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, including: the failure of products to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired results of the products; insufficient patient enrollment; insufficient investigator recruitment; the client's decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study; and cdd's failure to perform its duties properly under the contract. although its contracts often entitle it to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned up to the time of termination, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss, delay or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect cdd. contract research services in the drug development industry create liability risks. in contracting to work on drug development trials and studies, cdd faces a range of potential liabilities, including: errors or omissions that create harm to study volunteers during a trial or to consumers of a drug after the trial is completed and regulatory approval of the drug has been granted; general risks associated with clinical pharmacology facilities, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of clinical pharmacology medical care providers; risks that animals in cdd's breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in cdd's business policies, including those for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study or may delay the entry of a drug to the market. cdd also contracts with physicians, also referred to as investigators, to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on patients and volunteers. these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to volunteers, resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators. while cdd endeavors to include in its contracts provisions entitling it to be indemnified or entitling it to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not uniformly protect cdd against liability arising from certain of its own actions, such as negligence or misconduct. cdd could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision or in the event that a party who must indemnify it does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or in the event that the damages and costs exceed cdd's insurance coverage. there can be no assurance that cdd will be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage on terms acceptable to it. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters. the company may also receive inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies, including medicare or medicaid carriers, requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities or billing and pricing arrangements that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. the company's quarterly operating results may vary. the company's operating results, particularly for cdd, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by factors over which the company has little control such as: changes in the general global economy; exchange rate fluctuations; the commencement, completion, delay or cancellation of large projects or groups of projects; the progress of ongoing projects; 33 index the timing of and charges associated with completed acquisitions or other events; and changes in the mix of the company's services. the company believes that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. while fluctuations in the company's quarterly operating results could negatively or positively affect the market price of the company's common stock, these fluctuations may not be related to the company's future overall operating performance. cdd's revenues depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. cdd's revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in r&amp;d. in some instances, companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their r&amp;d projects. accordingly, economic factors and industry trends affecting cdd's clients in these industries may also affect cdd. if companies in these industries were to reduce the number of r&amp;d projects they conduct or outsource, whether through inability to raise capital, industry trends, economic conditions or otherwise, cdd could be materially adversely affected. actions of animal rights activists may have an adverse effect on the company. cdd's early development services utilize animals in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs, and also breed and sell animals for biomedical research. such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the u.s., europe, japan and other countries. acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have an adverse effect on the company. animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage cdd's inventory, harm its reputation, result in decreased sales of research products or result in other liability. it is important that research products be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, cause loss of animals in cdd's inventory, result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or result in other losses. such results could harm cdd's reputation or have an adverse effect on cdd's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. failure to conduct animal research in compliance with the animal welfare act could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the conduct of animal research at cdd's facilities must be in compliance with the awa, which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals used for research in the u.s. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the usda. the awa establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care and recordkeeping. cdd complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the usda and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions such as the european union and china for the care and use of regulated species. if the usda determines that cdd's equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable awa standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. for continued noncompliance, the usda may impose fines, suspend and/or revoke animal research licenses, or confiscate research animals. other countries where cdd conducts business may have similar laws with which cdd must also comply. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and drug development facilities could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies and in drug development will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, work stoppages or failure to comply with labor or employment laws could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and is subject to employment and labor laws and unionization activity in the u.s. and other countries in which it conducts business. disputes with regard to the terms of 34 index these agreements, its potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalities. if any of these events were to occur, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, or changes in labor labor or employment laws, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse impact upon the company's business. a significant increase in lcd's days sales outstanding could increase bad debt expense and have an adverse effect on the company's business including its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, lcd is experiencing increasing patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans which continue to increase deductibles, coinsurance and patient copayments. a material increase in lcd's days sales outstanding level could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially increasing its bad debt rate and decreasing its cash flows. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of the company's labcorp beacon platform could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's laboratory operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results or drug development data in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. the company is also continuing to enhance its labcorp beacon platform and could experience delays or deficiencies in the development process. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as adverse weather and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline of testing volumes in both segments. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's ability to register participants, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services ordered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement system enhancements or cyber security breaches may harm the company. the company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. a failure of the network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. while certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, there currently are not redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide it capacity in the event of a system failure. despite any precautions the company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at the company's various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to clients. in addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. 35 index in the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to clients. additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the company's reputation and harm the business. finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which the company has offices) and cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect the business. although the company carries property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur. security breaches and unauthorized access to the company or its customers' data could harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business. experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate the company's layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise personal information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the company's systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments, through illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. although the company believes that it has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the company may be unable to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. in addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the company's remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. breaches of the company's security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of personal information, proprietary or confidential information about the company or its customers or other third-parties, could expose customers' private information and could expose customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose the company or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for the company, damage the company's brand and reputation or otherwise harm the company's business. any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations. foreign currency exchange fluctuations and changes in reimbursement by foreign governments could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s. and cdd derives a large portion of its net revenues from international operations. since the company's consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on reported results. in addition, in certain circumstances, cdd may incur costs in one currency related to its services or products for which it is paid in a different currency. as a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect cdd's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. foreign currency exchange fluctuations and changes by foreign governments in reimbursement for lcd's services could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company's growing international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the expansion of the company's international operations exposes it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including export controls and trade regulations, changes in tax policies or other foreign laws, foreign labor and employee relations laws and regulations, restrictions on currency repatriation, judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights, countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights, and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. 36 index a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities and enhance therapeutic expertise, enhance esoteric testing and global drug development capabilities and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2010, the company has invested net cash of approximately $5.8 billion and equity of $1.8 billion in strategic business acquisitions ($2.2 billion over the same period excluding the acquisition of covance). however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. the company's substantially increased indebtedness could adversely affect the company's liquidity, results of operations and business. at december 31, 2015, indebtedness on the company's outstanding senior notes totaled approximately $5,525.0 million in aggregate principal. the company is also a party to credit agreements relating to a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a term loan with a principal balance of $ 715.0 million as of december 31, 2015. under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment grade-rated borrowers, and the company is required to maintain a leverage ratio that declines over time. the company's increased indebtedness could adversely affect its business. in particular, it could increase the company's vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. the company may also enter into additional transactions or credit facilities, including other long-term debt, which may increase its indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon the business. in addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate the company's debt based on a number of factors. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets. failure to successfully integrate the business of covance or to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse impact on the company's business, net revenues and profitability and the market price of its common stock. if the company fails to successfully complete the integration of covance into its existing operations or is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and integration, its business and results of operations could be negatively affected. in addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employees, errors or delays in systems implementation, the disruption of the company's ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, or disruptions in its relationships with suppliers and other parties with which it deals that could adversely affect the company's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. integration efforts could also place a significant burden on the company's management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities and improvements. the ongoing success of the transaction will depend, in significant part, on the company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, including the opportunity for revenue growth in development and commercialization of drugs and diagnostics, nutritional analysis and other areas, including a number of new business areas for the company. actual revenue growth may be 37 index lower than the company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated, and expenses may be higher than the company expects. the company has made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition and integration that may prove to be materially inaccurate, including: the company's assessments of the asset quality and value of covance and its assets; projections of the business and cdd's future financial performance; timing and total costs of integrating a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems; the company's ability to realize synergies and the timeline for doing so; the company's ability to develop, maintain and deepen relationships with cdd's customers; and other financial and strategic risks of the acquisition. if one or more of these assumptions are incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and operating results, and the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. in addition, although cdd is subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that the company faces in its business, the acquisition of covance also involves the company entering new product and services areas, markets and industries, which presents risks resulting from the company's relative inexperience in these new areas. cdd's business could react differently to economic and other external factors than the company's. the company faces the risk that it will not be successful with these new products and services or in these new markets. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 65 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. in the ordinary course of business, the company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the company regularly evaluates the exposure to such changes. the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign currency exchange rates approximately 17.7% of the company's net revenues for year ended december 31, 2015 and approximately 6.8% of those for year ended 2014 were denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company's financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into u.s. dollars for purposes of reporting the company's consolidated financial results. in 2015, the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the canadian dollar, swiss franc, euro and british pound. in 2014, the most significant currency exposure was to the canadian dollar. excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10% in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to u.s. dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2015 by approximately $9.6. gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity were $370.7 and $89.5 at december 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly-inflationary. the company earns revenue from service contracts over a period of several months and, in some cases, over a period of several years. accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect the company's profitability with respect to such contracts. the company is also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. the company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in some of its contracts with customers, or it may hedge transaction risk with foreign currency forward contracts. at december 31, 2015, the company had 4 open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2016 with a notional value totaling approximately $93.1 million. at december 31, 2014, the company had no open foreign exchange forward contracts. interest rates some of the company's debt is subject to interest at variable rates. as a result, fluctuations in interest rates affect the business. the company attempts to manage interest rate risk and overall borrowing costs through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt including by the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. borrowings under the company's term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. as of december 31, 2015, the company had approximately $715.0 of unhedged variable rate debt from the term loan credit facility. as of december 31, 2014 the company had no outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility and no term loan facility. 65 index during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for the 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month libor plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long term debt. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by s&amp;p's ratings services is bb- or lower. each quarter-point increase or decrease in the variable rate would result in the company's interest expense changing by approximately $1.8 per year for the company's unhedged variable rate debt.risk factors 26 risk factors investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the company's securities. the risks below are not the only ones that the company faces. additional risks not presently known to the company, or that the company presently deems immaterial, may also negatively impact the company. the company's business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors. this report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. the company's results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere. see forward-looking statements in item 7. changes in payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulations or approvals, or changes in other laws, regulations or policies in the u.s. may adversely affect u.s. governmental and third-party coverage or reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company. u.s. and state government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including managed care organizations (mcos), have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare and medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization, diagnosis code and other claims edits, or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for pathology services performed by lcd is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in third-party payer regulations, policies, or laboratory benefit or utilization management programs may have a material adverse impact on lcd's business. actions by federal and state agencies regulating insurance, including healthcare exchanges, or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon lcd's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from government programs if it violates federal, state, local or international laws including, but not limited to, anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the u.s. federal, state and local levels. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 (clia), or those of medicare, medicaid or other national, state or local agencies in the u.s. and other countries where the company operates laboratories. the commercial laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive u.s. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the u.s. 26 index by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the company also operates laboratories outside of the u.s. and is subject to laws governing its laboratory operations in the other countries where it operates. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company, which may be costly. fda regulation of diagnostic products and increased fda regulation of ldts could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the fda has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. the fda enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products. lcd's point-of-care testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. on july 26, 2007, the fda issued draft guidance for industry, clinical laboratories, and fda staff: in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays . the guidance proposed certain changes to the agency's general past practice regarding the regulation of certain ldts and announced that most devices deemed to be in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays (ivdmias) would either be class ii or class iii devices, although it is possible that an ivdmia for a low-risk indication could be class i. class ii medical devices typically require fda clearance or a premarket notification submission. class iii devices require the submission of an application for premarket approval. on october 3, 2014, the fda published two additional draft guidance documents: framework for regulatory oversight of laboratory developed tests (ldts), which provides an overview of how the fda would regulate ldts through a risk-based approach, and fda notification and medical device reporting for laboratory developed tests, which describes the process for clinical laboratories to notify the fda of the ldts they "manufacture" and describes the medical device reporting requirements for ldts. on may 28, 2015, and october 22, 2015, the house energy and commerce health subcommittee released discussion drafts of a bill that would reform oversight of in vitro clinical tests (ivcts), including both ldts and test kits. the bill would establish a new regulatory framework in which fda would regulate ivcts under a new category separate from medical devices, and cms regulation of laboratories under clia would be modernized. on november 16, 2015, the fda issued a report titled, the public health evidence for fda oversight of laboratory developed tests: 20 case studies (ldt report). the ldt report compiles 20 case studies involving ldts where fda alleges that noncompliance with fda regulations led to serious issues, such as false-positive or false-negative results, causing potential or actual harm to patients. on december 29, 2015, fda published notice of its intent to finalize guidance on its policy for regulatory oversight of ldts in 2016. however, on november 18, 2016, the fda announced it would not release final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and congress to determine the right approach, and on january 13, 2017, the fda released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for fda and cms oversight of ldts. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. the outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. current fda regulation of the company's diagnostic products and potential future increased regulation of the company's ldts could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. failure to comply with u.s., state, local or international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the u.s. occupational safety and health administration act and the u.s. needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. as previously discussed in item 1 of part i of this report, the company is subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions that would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company that may be costly. 27 index failure of the company, third-party payers or physicians to comply with the icd-10-cm code set could negatively impact the company's reimbursement, profitability and cash flow. the company implemented version 5010 of the hipaa transaction standards and believes it has fully adopted the icd-10-cm code set. clinical laboratories are typically required to submit healthcare claims with diagnosis codes to third-party payers. the diagnosis codes must be obtained from the ordering physician. the failure of the company, third-party payers or physicians to apply the new code set could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, days sales outstanding and cash collections. failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the company's reputation with customers and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in the u.s., the hipaa privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under hitech, establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (phi) by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of phi. hipaa restricts the company's ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa and hitech provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of phi are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including, but not limited to, treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of phi; the content of notices of privacy practices for phi; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive phi; and the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic phi. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the hipaa privacy and security requirements as applicable. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both additional federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts, resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of health information or other personal information. the company may also be required to comply with the data privacy and security laws of other countries in which it operates or from which it receives data transfers. for example, in europe both criminal and administrative sanctions are possible for violation of eu member state implementations of the general data protection directive 95/46/ec. in december 2015, the eu enacted a general data protection regulation (gdpr) to replace directive 95/46/ec, which will take effect may 25, 2018, and which has a broader application and enhanced penalties for noncompliance. the company is evaluating the scope of work required to comply with the new eu regulations, and as a result of that evaluation expects to make changes to its business practices and to incur additional costs. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for healthcare services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of hhs has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information, not usually provided to the company by physicians. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. as a result of inconsistent application of other transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. while the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade 28 index association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards-setting organizations, it may not be successful in these efforts. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company and the imposition of fines and penalties. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop or acquire licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the commercial laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its r&amp;d costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition, and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers (including physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives, generally referred to herein as physicians) in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most commercial laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories, and it has taken responsibility from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. healthcare reform and changes to related products (e.g., health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. lcd's testing services are billed to mcos, medicare, medicaid, physicians and physician groups, hospitals, patients and employer groups. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person who ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and mcos could have an adverse impact on the company's net revenues. the company serves many mcos. these organizations have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of their products. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of rates. other mcos adopt broader networks with generally uniform fee structures for participating clinical laboratories. in some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories, while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. mcos may also offer managed medicare or managed medicaid 29 index plans. in addition, some mcos use capitation rates to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the clinical laboratory receives a per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of laboratory tests provided to mco members during the month, regardless of the number of tests performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the commercial laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to ensure that its services are adequately compensated in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2016, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $225.8 million, or 3.4%, of the company's lcd net revenues. the company's ability to attract and retain mcos is critical given the impact of healthcare reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g. health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving delivery models (e.g., acos). a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues is collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. collectability may be impacted as patient cost-sharing increases. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including commercial laboratory services. measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicare plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicaid plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase; however, changes to, or repeal of, the aca may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable. further, structural reforms of medicare that could occur under the 115th congress and the new administration, such as the imposition of uniform coinsurance and the combination of the medicare part a and part b deductibles, could adversely affect laboratory reimbursement under medicare. the company also experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers required an extended period of time to price key molecular codes, and a number of those payers, mostly government entities, indicated that they would no longer pay for tests that they had previously covered. these issues (particularly payer policy changes) and changes in coverage had a negative impact on revenue, revenue per requisition, and margins and cash flows in 2014 through 2016, and are expected to have a continuing negative impact. similarly, clfs coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedures were implemented in 2016. the company experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of the new toxicology codes; however, the company largely overcame issues related to price and margins through direct negotiation with the associated payers. further coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedure types are expected to be implemented in 2017. the company expects delays in the pricing and implementation of these new codes. while the impact on price and margins is currently unclear, the company anticipates that some of that will be mitigated by timely negotiation with payers impacted by these changes. in addition, some mcos are implementing, directly or through third parties, various types of laboratory benefit management programs that may include lab networks, utilization management tools (such as prior authorization and/or prior notification), and claims edits, which may impact coverage or reimbursement for commercial laboratory tests. some of these programs address commercial laboratory testing broadly, while others are focused on molecular and genetic testing. the company expects the efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies, and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if lcd cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. in 2014, congress passed pama, requiring medicare to change the way payment rates are calculated for tests paid under the clfs, and to base the payment on the weighted median of rates paid by private payers. on june 23, 2016, cms published a final rule to implement pama. this rule requires applicable laboratories, including lcd, to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to cms during the first quarter of 2017, which cms would then use to calculate new clfs rates that would be effective january 1, 2018. healthcare reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company, as an employer, to implement significant process and record-keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, as well as the potential repeal and replacement of the aca in the 115th congress, the exact impact to employers, including the company, is uncertain. changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the biopharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for certain services that cdd provides. cdd assists biopharmaceutical companies in navigating the regulatory drug approval process. changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory 30 index requirements that cdd has difficulty satisfying or that make its services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for its services. also, if government efforts to contain drug costs impact biopharmaceutical company profits from new drugs, or if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursement for biopharmaceutical products, some of cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. on december 13, 2016, president obama signed into law the 21st century cures act. this act provides funding designed to increase government spending on certain drug development initiatives; contains several provisions designed to help make the drug development process more streamlined and efficient; and allows the fda to increase staffing to support drug development, review and regulation. these provisions should be helpful to biopharmaceutical companies and cros, including cdd, to the extent that they capitalize on the use of data, adaptive trial designs, real-world evidence, biomarkers and other development tools that are accepted by the fda. in addition, implementation of healthcare reform legislation that adds costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect r&amp;d expenditures by biopharmaceutical companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to cdd both in the u.s. and other countries. new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase cdd costs or limit service offerings through cdd. failure to comply with the regulations of the u.s. fda and other drug regulatory agencies, such as the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the u.k., the european medicines agency, the china food and drug administration, and the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency in japan, could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the operation of cdd's preclinical laboratory facilities and clinical trial operations must conform to glp and gcp, as applicable, as well as all other applicable standards and regulations, as further described in "business" in item 1 of this report. additionally, certain cdd services and activities must conform to cgmp as further described in "business" in item 1 of this report. failure to maintain compliance with glp, gcp, or cgmp regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in warning letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, and civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against cdd, including suspension of its laboratory operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. both lcd and cdd operate in highly competitive industries. the commercial laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by physicians and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of significant consolidation in the commercial laboratory industry, larger commercial laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. lcd may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. competitors in the cro industry range from hundreds of smaller cros to a limited number of large cros with global capabilities. cdd's main competition consists of these small and large cros, as well as in-house departments of biopharmaceutical companies and, to a lesser extent, select universities and teaching hospitals. cdd competes on a variety of factors, including: reputation for quality, timely performance and regulatory compliance; expertise and experience in operations, efficiency of drug development processes, technology, therapeutic areas, and market access services; scope of service offerings; strengths in various geographic markets; price; quality of facilities; ability to acquire, process, analyze and report data in a rapid and accurate manner; quality of relationships; ability to manage large-scale clinical trials both domestically and internationally, including the recruitment of appropriate and sufficient clinical trial subjects; and size and scale. cdd's services have from time to time experienced periods of increased price competition that had an adverse effect on a 31 index segment's profitability and consolidated net revenues and net income. there is competition among cros for both customers and potential acquisition candidates. additionally, entities considering entering the cro industry will find few barriers to entry, thus further increasing possible competition. these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness of cdd's services and could adversely affect its financial results and the financial results of the company. failure to obtain and retain new customers, the loss of existing customers or material contracts, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and/or create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of commercial laboratory services and to otherwise maintain and grow its business, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, a decrease in demand for the company's services from existing customers, or the loss of existing contracts, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of services, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community and the drug development industry, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company's ability to expand its customer base. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. lcd has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. lcd's inability to retain its existing relationships with those physicians as they become part of healthcare systems and networks and/or to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. continued and increased consolidation of mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems, physicians and other customers could adversely affect the company's business. many healthcare companies and providers, including mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems and physician practices are consolidating through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of transactions and collaborations. as the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services may become more intense. this competition and increased customer bargaining power may adversely affect the price and volume of the company's services. lcd's nutritional chemistry and food safety business exposes the company to various risks, including liability for errors and omissions in work conducted for lcd customers. lcd offers a range of product-development and product-integrity services to food and beverage manufacturers and retailers, industry organizations and academic institutions. lcd expects to expand its nutritional chemistry and food safety business by leveraging the company's expertise in microbiology and its infrastructure to enable testing to be performed close to the food source. lcd also is exploring the possibility of developing point-of-production testing for food safety. these business offerings and opportunities expose the company to many of the same, or similar, risks that are applicable to other business activities of the company, including with respect to the operations of its facilities and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the agricultural, food, beverage and dietary supplement industries are continuing to gain the attention of governments and regulators around the world, and regulations and applicable laws have increased in recent years. for example, many food and beverage manufacturers and retailers will be subject to new nutrition labeling regulations and new food manufacturing requirements, including regulations issued under the food safety modernization act (fsma). with these enhanced requirements on the company's customers, there is an increased risk that errors in or omissions from nutritional analysis and food safety tests conducted by the company for its customers could result in liability for the company under customer contracts. if lcd determines to further expand its nutritional chemistry and food safety testing business in the future beyond what is currently anticipated, lcd could become subject to additional standards and regulations, including under the fsma, and could face additional liabilities resulting from new and pending regulatory and other legal decisions. changes or disruption in services or supplies provided by third parties, including transportation, could adversely affect the company's business. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business. the company's laboratories and certain of the company's other businesses are heavily reliant on air travel for transport of clinical trial and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people, and a significant disruption to the air travel system, or the company's access to it, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. cdd depends on a limited number of suppliers for certain services and for certain animal populations. disruptions to the continued supply of these services, products or animal 32 index populations may arise from export/import restrictions or embargoes, political or economic instability, pressure from animal rights activists, adverse weather, natural disasters or other causes. disruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. damage or disruption to the company's facilities could adversely affect the company's business. many of the company's facilities would be difficult to replace in a short period of time. any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities might impact the company's ability to provide service to customers and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company bears financial risk for contracts that, for reasons beyond the company's control, may be underpriced, subject to cost overruns, delayed, or terminated or reduced in scope. the company has many contracts that are structured as fixed-price for fixed-contracted services or fee-for-service with a cap. the company bears the financial risk if these contracts are underpriced or if contract costs exceed estimates. such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. many of cdd's contracts, in particular, provide for services on a fixed-price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, including: failure of products to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired results of the products; insufficient clinical trial subject enrollment; insufficient investigator recruitment; customer's decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study; and cdd's failure to perform its duties properly under the contract. although its contracts often entitle it to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned up to the time of termination, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss, delay or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect cdd. contract research services in the drug development industry create liability risks. in contracting to work on drug development trials and studies, cdd faces a range of potential liabilities, including: errors or omissions that create harm to clinical trial subjects during a trial or to consumers of a drug after the trial is completed and regulatory approval of the drug has been granted; general risks associated with clinical pharmacology facilities, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of clinical pharmacology physicians; risks that animals in cdd's breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in cdd's business policies, including those for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study or may delay the entry of a drug to the market. cdd contracts with physicians, also referred to as investigators, to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on clinical trial subjects. these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to clinical trial subjects resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators. while cdd endeavors to include in its contracts provisions entitling it to be indemnified and entitling it to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not uniformly protect cdd against liability arising from certain of its own actions. cdd could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision, or in the event that a party which must indemnify it does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or in the event that cdd is not successful in limiting its liability or in the event that the damages and costs exceed cdd's insurance coverage. there can be no assurance that cdd will be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage on acceptable terms. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, contract disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters. the company may also receive inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies, including medicare or medicaid carriers, requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities or billing and pricing arrangements that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. 33 index the company's quarterly operating results may vary. the company's operating results, particularly for cdd, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by factors over which the company has little control, such as: changes in the general global economy; exchange rate fluctuations; the commencement, completion, delay or cancellation of large projects or groups of projects; the progress of ongoing projects; the timing of and charges associated with completed acquisitions or other events; and changes in the mix of the company's services. the company believes that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. while fluctuations in the company's quarterly operating results could negatively or positively affect the market price of the company's common stock, these fluctuations may not be related to the company's future overall operating performance. the failure to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to the company's intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company. many of the company's services, products and processes rely on intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. in some cases, that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to the company, sometimes exclusively. the value of the company's intellectual property relies in part on the company's ability to maintain its proprietary rights to such intellectual property. if the company is unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to its intellectual property, if it is unable to prevent attempted infringement against its intellectual property, or if it is unable to defend against claims that it is infringing on another party's intellectual property, the company could be adversely affected. these adverse effects could include the company having to abandon, alter and/or delay the deployment of products, services or processes that rely on such intellectual property; having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that the company seeks to use; and having to pay damages, fines, court costs and attorney's fees in connection with intellectual property litigation. cdd's revenues depend on the biopharmaceutical industry. cdd's revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the biopharmaceutical industry in r&amp;d. in some instances, biopharmaceutical companies are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their r&amp;d projects. biopharmaceutical companies are also reliant on reimbursement for their products from government programs and commercial payers. accordingly, economic factors and industry trends affecting cdd's customers in these industries may also affect cdd. if these companies were to reduce the number of r&amp;d projects they conduct or outsource, whether through the inability to raise capital, reductions in reimbursement from governmental programs or commercial payers, industry trends, economic conditions or otherwise, cdd could be materially adversely affected. actions of animal rights activists may have an adverse effect on the company. cdd's preclinical services utilize animals in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs. such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the u.s., europe, japan and other countries. cdd also breeds and sells animals for biomedical research. acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have an adverse effect on the company. animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage cdd's inventory, harm its reputation, result in decreased sales of research products or result in other liability. it is important that research products be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, cause loss of animals in cdd's inventory, result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or result in other losses. such results could harm cdd's reputation or have an adverse effect on cdd's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. failure to conduct animal research in compliance with animal welfare laws and regulation could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the conduct of animal research at cdd's facilities must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which those activities are conducted. these laws and regulations include the awa, which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals for research in the u.s. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the usda. the awa establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care and recordkeeping. similar laws and regulations 34 index apply in other jurisdictions in which cdd conducts animal research, including the european union and china. cdd complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by these laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it conducts animal research. if an enforcement agency determines that cdd's equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. for noncompliance, the agency may take action against cdd that may include fines, suspension and/or revocation of animal research licenses, or confiscation of research animals. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and drug development facilities could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies and in drug development will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform commercial laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, work stoppages or failure to comply with labor or employment laws could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and is subject to employment and labor laws and unionization activity in the u.s. and other countries in which it conducts business. disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements, potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalties. if any of these events were to occur, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, or changes in labor or employment laws, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse impact upon the company's business. a significant increase in lcd's or cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including its cash flow, by increasing its bad debt or decreasing its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers, including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, lcd is experiencing increasing patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans that continue to increase deductibles, coinsurance and patient copayments. a material increase in lcd's days sales outstanding level could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially increasing its bad debt rate and decreasing its cash flows. although cdd does not face the same level of complexity in its billing process, it could also experience delays in billing or collection, and a material increase in cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially decreasing its cash flows. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of the company's labcorp link platform could significantly increase testing turnaround time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results or drug development data in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. the company is also continuing to enhance its labcorp link platform and could experience delays or deficiencies in the development process. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement new systems or system enhancements to existing systems, and cyber security breaches may harm the company. the company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. a failure of the network or data-gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, 35 index customer orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. while certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, there currently are not redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide it capacity in the event of a system failure. despite any precautions the company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at the company's various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to customers. in addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. in the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server-hosting services. such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to customers. additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, or improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the company's reputation and harm the business. finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which the company has offices) and cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect the business. although the company carries property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur. security breaches and unauthorized access to the company's or its customers' data could harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business. the risk exists that experienced computer programmers and hackers could attack and potentially penetrate the company's layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise personal information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. they also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the company's systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments through illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics. although the company believes that it has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the company may be unable to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the company's remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. breaches of the company's security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of personal, proprietary or confidential information about the company or its customers or other third-parties could expose customers' private information. such breaches could expose customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose the company or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for the company, damage the company's brand and reputation or otherwise harm the company's business. any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as adverse weather and earthquakes, acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. natural disasters may result in a temporary decline of volumes in both segments. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's ability to efficiently commence studies, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, drug development services, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, biopharmaceutical companies and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services, as well as the ability of customers to pay for services rendered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s., and cdd derives a significant portion of its net revenues from international operations. since the company's consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on reported results. in addition, in certain circumstances, cdd may incur costs in one currency related to its services or products for which it is paid in a different currency. as a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect cdd's 36 index results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse impact on the company's business. the company's international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the company's international operations expose it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act and other international anti-corruption laws; changes in reimbursement by foreign governments for services provided by the company; compliance with export controls and trade regulations; changes in tax policies or other foreign laws; compliance with foreign labor and employee relations laws and regulations; restrictions on currency repatriation; judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights; countries that do not have clear or well-established laws and regulations concerning issues relating to commercial laboratory testing or drug development services; countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights; and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such may have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the company. u.s. and foreign governments continue to review, reform and modify tax laws, including with respect to the organisation for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting initiative. changes in tax laws and regulations could result in material changes to the domestic and foreign taxes that the company is required to provide for and pay. in addition, the company is subject to regular audits with respect to its various tax returns and processes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. errors or omissions in tax returns, process failures or differences in interpretation of tax laws by tax authorities and the company may lead to litigation, payments of additional taxes, penalties and interest. a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse impact on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities and enhance therapeutic expertise, enhance esoteric testing and global drug development capabilities, and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2010, the company has invested net cash of approximately $6.3 billion and equity of $1.8 billion in strategic business acquisitions ($2.7 billion over the same period excluding the acquisition). however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect the company's liquidity, results of operations and business. at december 31, 2016, indebtedness on the company's outstanding senior notes totaled approximately $5,200.0 million in aggregate principal. the company is also a party to credit agreements relating to a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a term loan with a principal balance of $565.0 million as of december 31, 2016. under the term loan facility and the revolving credit 37 index facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment-grade-rated borrowers, and the company is required to maintain a leverage ratio that declines over time. the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect its business. in particular, it could increase the company's vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing, and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions. the company may also enter into additional transactions or credit facilities, including other long-term debt, which may increase its indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon the business. in addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate the company's debt based on a number of factors. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets. failure to successfully integrate the business of covance or to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition could have a material adverse impact on the company's business, net revenues and profitability and the market price of its common stock. if the company fails to successfully complete the integration of covance into its existing operations or is not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and integration, its business and results of operations could be negatively affected. in addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employees; errors or delays in systems implementation; the disruption of the company's ongoing business; inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; or disruptions in its relationships with suppliers and other parties with which it deals that could adversely affect the company's ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. integration efforts could also place a significant burden on the company's management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities and improvements. the ongoing success of the transaction will depend, in significant part, on the company's ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition, including the opportunity for revenue growth in the development and commercialization of drugs and diagnostics, nutritional analysis and other areas, including a number of new business areas for the company. actual revenue growth may be lower than the company expects and may take longer to achieve than anticipated, and expenses may be higher than the company expects. the company has made certain assumptions relating to the acquisition and integration that may prove to be materially inaccurate, including: the company's assessments of the asset quality and value of cdd and its assets; projections of the business and cdd's future financial performance; timing and total costs of integrating a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems; the company's ability to realize synergies and the timeline for doing so; the company's ability to develop, maintain and deepen relationships with cdd's customers; and other financial and strategic risks of the acquisition. if one or more of these assumptions are incorrect, such efforts could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and operating results, and the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. in addition, although cdd is subject to many of the same risks and uncertainties that lcd faces in its business, the acquisition also involves the company entering new product and services areas, markets and industries, which presents risks resulting from the company's relative inexperience in these new areas. cdd's business could react differently to economic and other external factors than lcd's. the company faces the risk that it will not be successful with these new products and services or in these new markets. global economic conditions and government and regulatory changes, including, but not limited to, the united kingdom's announced intention to exit from the european union, could adversely impact the company's business and results of operations. the company could be adversely impacted due to the consequences of changes in the economy, governments or regulations across the globe. in june 2016, a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union (often referred to as brexit) in a national referendum. although the referendum was advisory, the current united kingdom government has indicated its intention to abide by the referendum and to initiate withdrawal proceedings in the near future. the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years after the government of the united kingdom formally initiates a withdrawal process. this will be either accompanied or followed by negotiations between the european union and the united kingdom concerning the future relations between the parties. this could introduce uncertainty with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply in the event of a withdrawal. however, until the brexit negotiation process is completed, it is difficult to anticipate how the clinical trial landscape in the united kingdom might change in the next several years. 38 index this type of development or other government or regulatory change could depress economic activity, which could adversely impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. this could include long-term volatility in the currency markets and long-term detrimental effects on the value of affected currencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 63 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk (in millions) market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. in the ordinary course of business, the company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the company regularly evaluates the exposure to such changes. the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign currency exchange rates approximately 10.3% of the company's net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2016 and approximately 11.0% of those for the year ended 2015 were denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company's financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into u.s. dollars for purposes of reporting the company's consolidated financial results. in both 2016 and 2015, the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the canadian dollar, swiss franc, euro and british pound. excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10% in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to u.s. dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2016 by approximately $6.1. gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity were $(250.0) and $(370.7) at december 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. the company earns revenue from service contracts over a period of several months and, in some cases, over a period of several years. accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect the company's profitability with respect to such contracts. the company is also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. the company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in some of its contracts with customers, or it may hedge transaction risk with foreign currency forward contracts. at december 31, 2016, the company had five open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2017 with a notional value totaling approximately 63 index $167.9 million. at december 31, 2015, the company had four open foreign exchange forward contracts relating to service contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2016 with a notional value totaling approximately $93.1 million. interest rates some of the company's debt is subject to interest at variable rates. as a result, fluctuations in interest rates affect the company's financial results. the company attempts to manage interest rate risk and overall borrowing costs through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt including the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. borrowings under the company's term loan credit facility and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015, the company had approximately $565.0 and $715.0 of unhedged variable rate debt under the term loan credit facility. during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for its 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month libor plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long-term debt. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by s&amp;p ratings services is bb- or lower. each quarter-point increase or decrease in the variable rate would result in the company's interest expense changing by approximately $1.4 per year for the company's unhedged variable rate debt.risk factors 29 risk factors investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the company's securities. the risks below are not the only ones that the company faces. additional risks not presently known to the company, or that it presently deems immaterial, may also negatively impact the company. the company's business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors. this report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. the company's results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere. see forward-looking statements in item 7. changes in payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulations or approvals, or changes in other laws, regulations or policies in the united states (u.s.) may adversely affect u.s. 29 index governmental and third-party coverage or reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company. u.s. and state government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including managed care organizations (mcos), have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. the first phase of reductions pursuant to protecting access to medicare act (pama) came into effect on january 1, 2018, and will continue annually subject to certain phase-in limits through 2023, and without limitations for subsequent periods. further reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization, diagnosis code and other claims edits, or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for pathology services performed by labcorp diagnostics (lcd) is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in third-party payer regulations, policies, or laboratory benefit or utilization management programs may have a material adverse effect on lcd's business. actions by federal and state agencies regulating insurance, including healthcare exchanges, or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon lcd's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from government programs if it violates federal, state, local or international laws including, but not limited to, anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state, and local levels in the u.s. and other countries where it operates. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals, and health systems could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 (clia), or those of medicare, medicaid or other national, state or local agencies in the u.s. and other countries where the company operates laboratories. the commercial laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive u.s. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the u.s. by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the company also operates laboratories outside of the u.s. and is subject to laws governing its laboratory operations in the other countries where it operates. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company, which may be costly. u.s. food and drug administration (fda) regulation of diagnostic products and increased fda regulation of laboratory-developed tests (ldts) could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties, and could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the fda has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. the fda enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products. lcd's point-of-care testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. on july 26, 2007, the fda issued draft guidance for industry, clinical laboratories, and fda staff: in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays . the guidance proposed certain changes to the agency's general past practice regarding the regulation of certain ldts and announced that most devices deemed to be in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays (ivdmias) would 30 index either be class ii or class iii devices, although it is possible that an ivdmia for a low-risk indication could be class i. class ii medical devices typically require fda clearance or a premarket notification submission. class iii devices require the submission of an application for premarket approval. on october 3, 2014, the fda published two additional draft guidance documents: framework for regulatory oversight of laboratory developed tests (ldts), which provides an overview of how the fda would regulate ldts through a risk-based approach, and fda notification and medical device reporting for laboratory developed tests, which describes the process for clinical laboratories to notify the fda of the ldts they "manufacture" and describes the medical device reporting requirements for ldts. on may 28, 2015, and october 22, 2015, the house energy and commerce health subcommittee released discussion drafts of a bill that would reform oversight of in vitro clinical tests (ivcts), including both ldts and test kits. the bill would establish a new regulatory framework in which the fda would regulate ivcts under a new category separate from medical devices, and the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) regulation of laboratories under clia would be modernized. on november 16, 2015, the fda issued a report titled, the public health evidence for fda oversight of laboratory developed tests: 20 case studies (ldt report). the ldt report compiles 20 case studies involving ldts where the fda alleges that noncompliance with the fda regulations led to serious issues, such as false-positive or false-negative results, causing potential or actual harm to patients. on december 29, 2015, the fda published notice of its intent to finalize guidance on its policy for regulatory oversight of ldts in 2016. however, on november 18, 2016, the fda announced it would not release final guidance and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and congress to determine the right approach, and on january 13, 2017, the fda released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for fda and cms oversight of ldts. later in 2017, the commissioner of the fda indicated that congress should enact legislation to address improved oversight of diagnostics including ldts, rather than the fda addressing the issue through administrative policy proposals. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. the outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. current fda regulation of the company's diagnostic products and potential future increased regulation of the company's ldts could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. failure to comply with u.s., state, local or international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the u.s. occupational safety and health administration act and the u.s. needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. as previously discussed in item 1 of part i of this report, the company is subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions that would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company that may be costly. failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the company's reputation with customers and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in the u.s., the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under u.s. health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech), establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (phi) by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of phi. hipaa restricts the company's ability to use or disclose phi, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa and hitech provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of phi are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including, but not limited to, treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of phi; the content of notices of privacy practices for phi; 31 index administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive phi; and the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic phi. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the hipaa privacy and security requirements as applicable. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both additional federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts, resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of health information or other personal information. the company may also be required to comply with the data privacy and security laws of other countries in which it operates or with which it transfers and receives data. for example, in europe both criminal and administrative sanctions are possible for violation of european union (eu) member state implementations of the general data protection directive 95/46/ec. in december 2015, the eu enacted a general data protection regulation (gdpr) to replace directive 95/46/ec, which will take effect may 25, 2018, and which has a broader application and enhanced penalties for noncompliance. the company is executing on its gdpr readiness project to support compliance with the gdpr. the gdpr creates a range of new compliance obligations for subject companies and substantially increases financial penalties for non-compliance. the costs of compliance with the gdpr and the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a violation of the gdpr may have a significant adverse effect on the company's business and operations. in addition, similar data protection regulations addressing access, use, disclosure and transfer of personal data have been enacted or updated in countries where the company does business in asia, latin america, canada and europe. the company expects to make changes to its business practices and to incur additional costs associated with compliance with these evolving and complex regulations. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for healthcare services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company's profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs) has issued regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. the hipaa transaction standards are complex and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require the company to provide certain types of information, including demographic information, not usually provided to the company by physicians. in addition, requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. as a result of inconsistent application of other transaction standards by payers or the company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the company by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. while the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claim submission and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards-setting organizations, it may not be successful in these efforts. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation. the company receives certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. a compromise in the company's security systems that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company and the imposition of fines and penalties. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop or acquire licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the commercial laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these 32 index testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development (r&amp;d) costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition, and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers (including physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives, generally referred to herein as physicians) in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and the utilization of certain tests offered by the company and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most commercial laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories, and it has taken responsibility from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. healthcare reform and changes to related products (e.g., health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse effect on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. lcd's testing services are billed to mcos, medicare, medicaid, physicians and physician groups, hospitals, patients and employer groups. tests ordered by a physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical insurance benefits of a particular patient. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person who ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and mcos could have an adverse effect on the company's net revenues. the company serves many mcos. these organizations have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of their products. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of rates. other mcos adopt broader networks with generally uniform fee structures for participating clinical laboratories. in some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories, while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. mcos may also offer managed medicare or managed medicaid plans. in addition, some mcos use capitation rates to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the clinical laboratory receives a per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of laboratory tests provided to mco members during the month, regardless of the number of tests performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the commercial laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to ensure that its services are adequately compensated in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2017, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $259.1 million, or 3.6%, of lcd's net revenues. the company's ability to attract and retain mcos is critical given the impact of healthcare reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g. health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving delivery models (e.g., accountable care organizations). a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues is collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. as patient cost-sharing has been increasing the company's collections may be adversely impacted. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including commercial laboratory services. measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicare plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicaid plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase; however, changes to, or repeal of, the patient protection and affordable care act (aca) may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and 33 index utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable. further healthcare reform could adversely affect laboratory reimbursement from medicare, medicaid or commercial carriers. the company also experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers required an extended period of time to price key molecular codes, and a number of those payers, mostly government entities, indicated that they would no longer pay for tests that they had previously covered. these issues (particularly payer policy changes) and changes in coverage had a negative impact on revenue, revenue per requisition, and margins and cash flows in 2014 through 2017, and are expected to have a continuing negative impact. similarly, the clinical laboratory fee schedule (clfs) coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedures were implemented in 2016 and 2017. the company experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of the new toxicology codes; however, the company largely overcame issues related to price and margins through direct negotiation with the associated payers. limited coding and billing changes related to other procedure types are expected to be implemented in 2018. the company expects some continued delays in the pricing and implementation of these new codes. in addition, some mcos are implementing, directly or through third parties, various types of laboratory benefit management programs that may include lab networks, utilization management tools (such as prior authorization and/or prior notification), and claims edits, which may impact coverage or reimbursement for commercial laboratory tests. some of these programs address commercial laboratory testing broadly, while others are focused on molecular and genetic testing. the company expects the efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies, and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if lcd cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume, and/or introducing new services and procedures, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. in 2014, congress passed pama, requiring medicare to change the way payment rates are calculated for tests paid under the clfs, and to base the payment on the weighted median of rates paid by private payers. on june 23, 2016, cms issued a final rule to implement pama that required applicable laboratories, including lcd, to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to cms during the first quarter of 2017. cms exercised enforcement discretion to permit reporting for an additional 60 days, through may 30, 2017. cms used that private market data to calculate weighted median prices for each test (based on applicable cpt codes) to represent the new clfs rates beginning in 2018, subject to certain phase-in limits. for 2018-2020, a test price cannot be reduced by more than 10.0% per year; for 2021-2023, a test price cannot be reduced by more than 15.0% per year. the process of data reporting and repricing will be repeated every three years for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (cdlts). the second data reporting period for cdlts will occur during the first quarter of 2020, and new clfs rates for cdlts will be established based on that data beginning in 2021, subject to the previously described phase-in limits for 2021-2023. the third data reporting period for cdlts will occur during the first quarter of 2023, and new clfs rates for cdlts will be established based on that data beginning in 2024. clfs rates for 2024 and subsequent periods will not be subject to phase-in limits. clfs rates for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests (adlts) will be updated annually. cms published its initial proposed clfs rates under pama for 2018-2020 on september 22, 2017. following a public comment period, cms made adjustments and published final clfs rates for 2018-2020 on november 17, 2017, with additional adjustments published on december 1, 2017. for 2018, the company estimates that clfs rates will reduce lcd revenue from all payers affected by the clfs by a total of approximately 8% ($70.0 million). the company supports the efforts of the american clinical laboratory association (acla) to work with congress on potential legislative reform of pama, which if enacted could reduce the negative impact of pama as implemented by cms. healthcare reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company, as an employer, to implement significant process and record-keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, as well as potential changes to the aca, the exact impact to employers, including the company, is uncertain. changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the biopharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for certain services that covance drug development (cdd) provides. cdd assists biopharmaceutical companies in navigating the regulatory drug approval process. changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that cdd has difficulty satisfying or that make its services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for its services. also, if government efforts to contain drug costs impact biopharmaceutical company profits from new drugs, or if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursement for biopharmaceutical products, some of cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. on december 13, 2016, the 21st century cures act was signed into law. this act provides funding designed to increase government spending on certain drug development initiatives; contains several provisions designed to help make the drug development process more streamlined and efficient; and allows the fda to increase staffing to support drug development, review 34 index and regulation. these provisions should be helpful to biopharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations (cros), including cdd, to the extent that they capitalize on the use of data, adaptive trial designs, real-world evidence, biomarkers and other development tools that are accepted by the fda. in addition, implementation of healthcare reform legislation that adds costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect r&amp;d expenditures by biopharmaceutical companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to cdd both in the u.s. and other countries. new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase cdd costs or limit service offerings through cdd. failure to comply with the regulations of drug regulatory agencies, such as the fda, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom (u.k.), the european medicines agency, the china food and drug administration, and the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency in japan, could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the operation of cdd's preclinical laboratory facilities and clinical trial operations must conform to good laboratory practice (glp) and good clinical practice (gcp), as applicable, as well as all other applicable standards and regulations, as further described in item 1 of part i of this report. the business operations of cdd's clinical and preclinical laboratories also require the import and export of medical devices, in vitro diagnostic devices, reagents, and human and animal biological products. such activities are subject to numerous applicable local and international regulations with which cdd must comply or be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies, including suspension of its ability to import or export to or from certain countries, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. additionally, certain cdd services and activities must conform to current good manufacturing practice (cgmp) as further described in item 1 of part i of this report. failure to maintain compliance with glp, gcp, or cgmp regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in warning letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, and civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against cdd, including suspension of its laboratory operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse effect on the company's net revenues and profitability. as further described in item 1 of part i of this report, both lcd and cdd operate in highly competitive industries. the commercial laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by physicians, third-party payers and consumers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of significant consolidation in the commercial laboratory industry, larger commercial laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. lcd may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services, or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. competitors in the cro industry range from hundreds of smaller cros to a limited number of large cros with global capabilities. cdd's main competition consists of these small and large cros, as well as in-house departments of biopharmaceutical companies and, to a lesser extent, select universities and teaching hospitals. cdd's services have from time to time experienced periods of increased price competition that had an adverse effect on a segment's profitability and consolidated net revenues and net income. there is competition among cros for both customers and potential acquisition candidates. additionally, few barriers to entering the cro industry further increases possible new competition. these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness or profitability of lcd's and cdd's services, and could adversely affect the financial results of the company. failure to obtain and retain new customers, the loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in services or tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and/or create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to maintain and grow its business, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, a decrease in demand for the company's services from existing customers, or the loss of existing contracts, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse effect on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of services, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community and the drug development industry, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the 35 index company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of existing customers, an inability to gain new customers and a reduction in the company's business. continued and increased consolidation of mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems, physicians and other customers could adversely affect the company's business. many healthcare companies and providers, including mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems and physician practices are consolidating through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of transactions and collaborations. in addition to these more traditional horizontal mergers that involve entities that previously competed against each other, the healthcare industry is experiencing an increase in vertical mergers, which involve entities that previously did not offer competing goods or services. as the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services may become more intense, and vertical mergers may give those combined companies greater control over more aspects of healthcare, including increased bargaining power. this competition and increased customer bargaining power may adversely affect the price and volume of the company's services. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. lcd has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. lcd's inability to retain its existing relationships with those physicians as they become part of healthcare systems and networks and/or to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. lcd's nutritional chemistry and food safety business exposes the company to various risks, including liability for errors and omissions in work conducted for lcd customers. lcd offers a range of product-development and product-integrity services to food and beverage manufacturers and retailers, industry organizations and academic institutions. lcd also is exploring the possibility of developing point-of-production testing for food safety. these business offerings and opportunities expose the company to many of the same, or similar, risks that are applicable to other business activities of the company, including with respect to the operations of its facilities and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the agricultural, food, beverage and dietary supplement industries are continuing to gain the attention of governments and regulators around the world, and regulations and applicable laws have increased in recent years. for example, many food and beverage manufacturers and retailers will be subject to new nutrition labeling regulations and new food manufacturing requirements, including regulations issued under the food safety modernization act (fsma). with these enhanced requirements on the company's customers, there is an increased risk that errors in or omissions from nutritional analysis and food safety tests conducted by the company for its customers could result in liability for the company under customer contracts. if lcd determines to further expand its nutritional chemistry and food safety testing business in the future beyond what is currently anticipated, lcd could become subject to additional standards and regulations, including under the fsma, and could face additional liabilities resulting from new and pending regulatory and other legal actions. changes or disruption in services or supplies provided by third parties, including transportation, could adversely affect the company's business. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business. although the company has a significant proprietary network of ground and air transport capabilities, certain of the company's businesses are heavily reliant on third-party ground and air travel for transport of clinical trial and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people. a significant disruption to these travel systems, or the company's access to them, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. the company is also reliant on an extensive network of third-party suppliers and vendors of certain services and products, including for certain animal populations. disruptions to the continued supply of these services, products, or animal populations may arise from export/import restrictions or embargoes, political or economic instability, pressure from animal rights activists, adverse weather, natural disasters, transportation disruptions, or other causes. disruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. damage or disruption to the company's facilities could adversely affect the company's business. many of the company's facilities could be difficult to replace in a short period of time. any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities might impact the company's ability to provide service to customers and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company bears financial risk for contracts that, for reasons beyond the company's control, may be underpriced, subject to cost overruns, delayed, or terminated or reduced in scope. the company has many contracts that are structured as fixed-price for fixed-contracted services or fee-for-service with a cap. the company bears the financial risk if these contracts are underpriced or if contract costs exceed estimates. such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition 36 index and cash flows. many of cdd's contracts, in particular, provide for services on a fixed-price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, including: failure of products to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired results of the products; insufficient clinical trial subject enrollment; insufficient investigator recruitment; a customer's decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study; and cdd's failure to perform its duties properly under the contract. although its contracts often entitle it to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned up to the time of termination, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss, delay or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect cdd. contract research services in the drug development industry create liability risks. in contracting to work on drug development trials and studies, cdd faces a range of potential liabilities, including: errors or omissions that create harm to clinical trial subjects during a trial or to consumers of a drug after the trial is completed and regulatory approval of the drug has been granted; general risks associated with clinical pharmacology facilities, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of clinical pharmacology physicians; risks that animals in cdd's breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in cdd's business policies, including those for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study or may delay the entry of a drug to the market. cdd contracts with physicians, also referred to as investigators, to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on clinical trial subjects. these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to clinical trial subjects resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators. while cdd endeavors to include in its contracts provisions entitling it to be indemnified and entitling it to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not uniformly protect cdd against liability arising from certain of its own actions. cdd could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision, or in the event that a party which must indemnify it does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or in the event that cdd is not successful in limiting its liability or in the event that the damages and costs exceed cdd's insurance coverage. there can be no assurance that cdd will be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage on acceptable terms. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, contract disputes, data and privacy issues, professional liability and employee-related matters. the company may also receive inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies, including medicare or medicaid payers, requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities, billing and pricing arrangements, or privacy practices that are brought to their attention through audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. the company's quarterly operating results may vary. the company's operating results, particularly for cdd, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by factors over which the company has little control, such as: changes in the general global economy; exchange rate fluctuations; the commencement, completion, delay or cancellation of large projects or groups of projects; the progress of ongoing projects; the timing of and charges associated with completed acquisitions or other events; and changes in the mix of the company's services. the company believes that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. while fluctuations in the company's quarterly operating results could negatively or positively affect the market price of 37 index the company's common stock, these fluctuations may not be related to the company's future overall operating performance. the failure to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to the company's intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company. many of the company's services, products and processes rely on intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. in some cases, that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to the company, sometimes exclusively. the value of the company's intellectual property relies in part on the company's ability to maintain its proprietary rights to such intellectual property. if the company is unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to its intellectual property, if it is unable to prevent attempted infringement against its intellectual property, or if it is unable to defend against claims that it is infringing on another party's intellectual property, the company could be adversely affected. these adverse effects could include the company having to abandon, alter and/or delay the deployment of products, services or processes that rely on such intellectual property; having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that the company seeks to use; and having to pay damages, fines, court costs and attorney's fees in connection with intellectual property litigation. cdd's revenues depend on the biopharmaceutical industry. cdd's revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the biopharmaceutical industry in r&amp;d. in some instances, biopharmaceutical companies are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their r&amp;d projects. biopharmaceutical companies are also reliant on reimbursement for their products from government programs and commercial payers. accordingly, economic factors and industry trends affecting cdd's customers in these industries may also affect cdd. if these companies were to reduce the number of r&amp;d projects they conduct or outsource, whether through the inability to raise capital, reductions in reimbursement from governmental programs or commercial payers, industry trends, economic conditions or otherwise, cdd could be materially adversely affected. actions of animal rights activists may have an adverse effect on the company. cdd's preclinical services utilize animals in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs. such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the u.s., europe, japan and other countries. cdd also breeds and sells animals for biomedical research. acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have an adverse effect on the company. animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage cdd's inventory, harm its reputation, result in decreased sales of research products or result in other liability. it is important that research products be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, cause loss of animals in cdd's inventory, result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or result in other losses. such results could harm cdd's reputation or have an adverse effect on cdd's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. failure to conduct animal research in compliance with animal welfare laws and regulations could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the conduct of animal research at cdd's facilities must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which those activities are conducted. these laws and regulations include the u.s animal welfare act (awa), which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals for research in the u.s. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the u.s. department of agriculture (usda). the awa establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care and recordkeeping. similar laws and regulations apply in other jurisdictions in which cdd conducts animal research, including the european union and china. cdd complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by these laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it conducts animal research. if an enforcement agency determines that cdd's equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. for noncompliance, the agency may take action against cdd that may include fines, suspension and/or revocation of animal research licenses, or confiscation of research animals. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and drug development facilities could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies and in drug development will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform commercial laboratory testing 38 index services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, work stoppages or failure to comply with labor or employment laws could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to a limited number of collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and is subject to employment and labor laws and unionization activity in the u.s. and other countries in which it conducts business. disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements, potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalties. if any of these events were to occur, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, or changes in labor or employment laws, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. a significant increase in lcd's or cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including its cash flow, by increasing its bad debt or decreasing its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers, including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, lcd has experienced an increase in patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans that continue to increase deductibles, coinsurance and patient copayments. lcd expects this trend to continue. a material increase in lcd's days sales outstanding level could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially increasing its bad debt rate and decreasing its cash flows. although cdd does not face the same level of complexity in its billing process, it could also experience delays in billing or collection, and a material increase in cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially decreasing its cash flows. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of updates or enhancements to those systems could significantly increase testing turnaround time or delay billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results or drug development data in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement new systems or system enhancements to existing systems, and cyber security breaches may harm the company. the company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. a failure of the network or data-gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, customer orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. while certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, there currently are not redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide information technology capacity in the event of a system failure. despite any precautions the company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at the company's various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to customers. in addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. in the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server-hosting services. such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to customers. additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, or improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the company's reputation and harm the business. finally, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, acts of terrorism (particularly involving cities in which the company has offices) and cybersecurity breaches could adversely affect the business. although the company carries property and business interruption insurance, the coverage may not be adequate to compensate for all losses that may occur. 39 index security breaches and unauthorized access to the company's or its customers' data could harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business. the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience attempts by computer programmers and hackers to attack and penetrate the company's layered security controls. these attempts, if successful, could result in the misappropriation or compromise of personal information or proprietary or confidential information stored within the company's systems, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. external actors may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the company's systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments through illegal electronic spamming, phishing, spear phishing, or other tactics. although the company has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the company may be unable to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the company's remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. breaches of the company's security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of personal, proprietary or confidential information about the company or its customers or other third-parties could expose customers' private information. such breaches could expose customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose the company or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for the company, damage the company's brand and reputation or otherwise harm the company's business. any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as adverse weather and earthquakes, acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. natural disasters may result in a temporary decline of volumes in both segments. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's ability to efficiently commence studies, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, drug development services, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, biopharmaceutical companies and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services, as well as the ability of customers to pay for services rendered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s., and cdd derives a significant portion of its net revenues from international operations. since the company's consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on reported results. in addition, cdd may incur costs in one currency related to its services or products for which it is paid in a different currency. as a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect cdd's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the company's international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the company's international operations expose it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, changes in reimbursement by foreign governments for services provided by the company; compliance with export controls and trade regulations; changes in tax policies or other foreign laws; compliance with foreign labor and employee relations laws and regulations; restrictions on currency repatriation; judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights; countries that do not have clear or well-established laws and regulations concerning issues relating to commercial laboratory testing or drug development services; countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights; and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and 40 index regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. expanded international operations may increase the company's exposure to liabilities under the anti-corruption laws. anti-corruption laws in the countries where the company conducts business, including the fcpa, the bribery act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery including improperly offering, promising, paying or authorizing the giving of anything of value to individuals or entities for the purpose of corruptly obtaining or retaining business. the company operates in some parts of the world where corruption may be common and where anti-corruption laws may conflict to some degree with local customs and practices. the company maintains an anti-corruption program including policies, procedures and training and safeguards in the engagement and management of third parties acting on the company's behalf. despite these safeguards, the company cannot guarantee protection from corrupt acts committed by third parties associated with the company. violations or allegations of violations of anti-corruption laws could have a significant adverse effect on the business or results of operations. changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such may have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the company. u.s. and foreign governments continue to review, reform and modify tax laws, including with respect to the organisation for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting initiative. changes in tax laws and regulations could result in material changes to the domestic and foreign taxes that the company is required to provide for and pay. in addition, the company is subject to regular audits with respect to its various tax returns and processes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. errors or omissions in tax returns, process failures or differences in interpretation of tax laws by tax authorities and the company may lead to litigation, payments of additional taxes, penalties and interest. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) was passed into law. the tcja has given rise to significant one-time and ongoing changes to the taxes recognized and paid by the company, and the full impact of the changes may only become fully understood over time. a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse effect on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities and enhance therapeutic expertise, enhance esoteric testing and global drug development capabilities, and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2013, the company has invested net cash of approximately $6.5 billion and equity of $1.8 billion in strategic business acquisitions. however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect the company's liquidity, results of operations and business. at december 31, 2017, indebtedness on the company's outstanding senior notes totaled approximately $5,900.0 million in aggregate principal. the company is also a party to credit agreements relating to a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, a 2014 term loan with a principal balance of $72.0 million, and a 2017 term loan with a balance of $750.0 million as of december 31, 2017. under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment-grade-rated borrowers, and the company is required to maintain a leverage ratio within certain limits. 41 index the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect its business. in particular, it could increase the company's vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing, and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions. the company may also enter into additional transactions or credit facilities, including other long-term debt, which may increase its indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon the business. in addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate the company's debt based on a number of factors. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets. global economic conditions and government and regulatory changes, including, but not limited to, the u.k.'s pending exit from the european union (e.u.), could adversely impact the company's business and results of operations. the company could be adversely impacted due to the consequences of changes in the economy, governments or regulations across the globe. in june 2016, a majority of voters in the u.k. elected to withdraw from the e.u. (often referred to as brexit) in a national referendum. although the referendum was advisory, the current u.k. government is abiding by the referendum and is in negotiations to withdraw from the e.u. in the near future. the terms of any withdrawal and future relations between the e.u. and the u.k. are not yet determined. while it appears that e.u. laws and regulations will continue to apply in the u.k. until the withdrawal is completed, it is difficult to anticipate how the clinical trial landscape in the u.k. might change in the next several years. this type of development or other government or regulatory change could depress economic activity, which could adversely impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. this could include long-term volatility in the currency markets and long-term detrimental effects on the value of affected currencies. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 68 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk (in millions) market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. in the ordinary course of business, the company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the company regularly evaluates the exposure to such changes. the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign currency exchange rates approximately 10.2% of the company's net revenues for the year ended december 31, 2017 and approximately 10.3% of those for the year ended 2016 were denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company's financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into u.s. dollars for purposes of reporting the company's consolidated financial results. in both 2017 and 2016, the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the canadian dollar, swiss franc, euro and british pound. excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10% in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to u.s. dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2016 by approximately $2.3. gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity were $262.3 and $(250.0) at december 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. the company earns revenue from service contracts over a period of several months and, in some cases, over a period of several years. accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect the company's profitability with respect to such 68 index contracts. the company is also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. the company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in some of its contracts with customers, or it may hedge transaction risk with foreign currency forward contracts. at december 31, 2017, the company had 26 open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2018 with a notional value totaling approximately $360.5. at december 31, 2016, the company had five open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2017 with a notional value totaling approximately $167.9. interest rates some of the company's debt is subject to interest at variable rates. as a result, fluctuations in interest rates affect the company's financial results. the company attempts to manage interest rate risk and overall borrowing costs through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt including the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. borrowings under the company's term loan credit facilities and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. as of december 31, 2017, and 2016, the company had approximately $ 72.0 and $ 565.0 , respectively, of unhedged variable rate debt under the 2014 term loan credit facility and $750.0 and $0.0 , respectively, under the 2017 term loan credit facility. during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for its 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month libor plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long-term debt. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by s&amp;p ratings services is bb- or lower. each quarter-point increase or decrease in the variable rate would result in the company's interest expense changing by approximately $2.1 per year for the company's unhedged variable rate debt.risk factors 31 risk factors investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the company's securities. the risks below are not the only ones that the company faces. additional risks not presently known to the company, or that it presently deems immaterial, may also negatively impact the company. the company's business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors. this report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. the company's results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere. see forward-looking statements in item 7. changes in payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulations or approvals, or changes in other laws, regulations or policies in the united states (u.s.), may adversely affect u.s. governmental and third-party coverage or reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company. u.s. and state government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including managed care organizations (mcos), have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. the first phase of reductions pursuant to the protecting access to medicare act (pama) came into effect on january 1, 2018, and will continue annually subject to certain phase-in limits through 2023, and without limitations for subsequent periods. further reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization, diagnosis code and other claims edits, or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for pathology services performed by labcorp diagnostics (lcd) is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in third-party payer regulations, policies, or laboratory benefit or utilization management programs may have a material adverse effect on lcd's business. actions by federal and state agencies regulating insurance, including healthcare exchanges, or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon lcd's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from government programs if it violates anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state, and local levels in the u.s. and other countries where it operates. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals, and health systems could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. this risk includes, but is not limited to, the potential that government enforcement authorities may take a contrary position with respect to the eliminating kickbacks in recovery act (ekra), given its recent passage and lack of associated regulations to clarify or add exceptions. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships. 31 index the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 (clia), or those of medicare, medicaid or other national, state or local agencies in the u.s. and other countries where the company operates laboratories. the commercial laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive u.s. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the u.s. by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the company also operates laboratories outside of the u.s. and is subject to laws governing its laboratory operations in the other countries where it operates. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company, which may be costly. u.s. food and drug administration (fda) regulation of diagnostic products and increased fda regulation of laboratory-developed tests (ldts) could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties, and could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the fda has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. the fda enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products. lcd's point-of-care testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. since the 1990s, the fda has asserted that it has authority to regulate ldts as medical devices, but has exercised enforcement discretion to refrain from systematic regulation of ldts. in 2014, the fda issued draft guidance describing how it intended to discontinue its enforcement discretion policy and begin regulating ldts as medical devices; however, that draft guidance has not been finalized, and fda has instead continued its enforcement discretion policy and has indicated that it intends to work with congress to enact comprehensive legislative preform of diagnostics oversight. as such, ldts developed by high complexity clinical laboratories are currently generally offered as services to health care providers under the clia regulatory framework administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) of the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs), without the requirement for fda clearance or approval. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. the outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. current fda regulation of the company's diagnostic products and potential future increased regulation of the company's ldts could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. failure to comply with u.s., state, local or international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the u.s. occupational safety and health administration act and the u.s. needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. as previously discussed in item 1 of part i of this report, the company is subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions that would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company that may be costly. failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the company's reputation with customers and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. 32 index in the u.s., the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under u.s. health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech), establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (phi), by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of phi. hipaa restricts the company's ability to use or disclose phi, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa and hitech provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of phi are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including, but not limited to, treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of phi; the content of notices of privacy practices for phi; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive phi; and the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic phi. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the hipaa privacy and security requirements as applicable. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both additional federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts, resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of health information or other personal information. on june 28, 2018, the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), which becomes effective january 1, 2020. the ccpa creates new transparency requirements and grants california residents several new rights with regard their personal information. failure to comply with the ccpa may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. the company is executing on a plan to support compliance with the ccpa. the company may also be required to comply with the data privacy and security laws of other countries in which it operates or with which it transfers and receives data. for example, the european union's (eu) general data protection regulation (gdpr), which took effect may 25, 2018, created a range of new compliance obligations for subject companies and imposes penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. the company has established processes and frameworks to manage compliance with the gdpr, but there remains uncertainty as to how eu supervisory authorities will interpret and enforce the regulation. the costs of compliance with the gdpr could be significant. potential fines and penalties in the event of a violation of the gdpr could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and operations. in addition, similar data protection regulations addressing access, use, disclosure and transfer of personal data have been enacted or updated in countries where the company does business in asia, latin america, canada and europe. the company expects to make changes to its business practices and to incur additional costs associated with compliance with these evolving and complex regulations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. the company receives and stores certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. the company also works with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that are used in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of customer personal and financial information. a compromise in the company's security systems, or those of the company's third party service providers and vendors, that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's or third party's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company and the imposition of fines and penalties. 33 index discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop or acquire licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the commercial laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development (r&amp;d) costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition, and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers (including physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives, generally referred to herein as physicians) in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and the utilization of certain tests offered by the company and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most commercial laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories, and it has taken responsibility from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. healthcare reform and changes to related products (e.g., health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse effect on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flow. lcd's testing services are billed to mcos, medicare, medicaid, physicians and physician groups, hospitals, patients and employer groups. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person who ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and mcos could have an adverse effect on the company's net revenues. the company serves many mcos. these organizations have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of their products. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of rates. other mcos adopt broader networks with generally uniform fee structures for participating clinical laboratories. in some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories, while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. mcos may also offer managed medicare or managed medicaid plans. in addition, some mcos use capitation rates to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the clinical laboratory receives a per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of laboratory tests provided to mco members during the month, regardless of the number of tests performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the commercial laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to obtain adequate compensation for its services in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2018, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $279.3 million, or 4.0%, of lcd's revenues. the company's ability to attract and retain mcos is critical given the impact of healthcare reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g. health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving value-based care and risk-based reimbursement delivery models (e.g., accountable care organizations (acos) and independent physician associations (ipas)). 34 index a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues is collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. as patient cost-sharing has been increasing, the company's collections may be adversely impacted. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including commercial laboratory services. measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicare plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicaid plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase; however, changes to, or repeal of, the patient protection and affordable care act (aca) may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable. further healthcare reform could adversely affect laboratory reimbursement from medicare, medicaid or commercial carriers. the company also experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers required an extended period of time to price key molecular codes, and a number of those payers, mostly government entities, indicated that they would no longer pay for tests that they had previously covered. these issues (particularly payer policy changes) and changes in coverage had a negative impact on revenue, revenue per requisition, and margins and cash flows in 2014 through 2018, and are expected to have a continuing negative impact. similarly, the clinical laboratory fee schedule (clfs) coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedures were implemented in 2016 and 2017. the company experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of the new toxicology codes; however, the company largely overcame issues related to price and margins through direct negotiation with the associated payers. limited coding and billing changes related to other procedure types were implemented in 2018, and further changes are expected to be implemented in 2019. the company expects some continued delays in the pricing and implementation of these new codes. in addition, some mcos are implementing, directly or through third parties, various types of laboratory benefit management programs that may include lab networks, utilization management tools (such as prior authorization and/or prior notification), and claims edits, which may impact coverage or reimbursement for commercial laboratory tests. some of these programs address commercial laboratory testing broadly, while others are focused on molecular and genetic testing. the company expects the efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies, and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if lcd cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume, and/or introducing new services and procedures, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's net revenues, profitability and cash flows. in 2014, congress passed pama, requiring medicare to change the way payment rates are calculated for tests paid under the clfs, and to base the payment on the weighted median of rates paid by private payers. on june 23, 2016, cms issued a final rule to implement pama that required applicable laboratories, including lcd, to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to cms during the first quarter of 2017. cms exercised enforcement discretion to permit reporting for an additional 60 days, through may 30, 2017. cms used that private market data to calculate weighted median prices for each test (based on applicable current procedural technology (cpt) codes) to represent the new clfs rates beginning in 2018, subject to certain phase-in limits. for 2018-2020, a test price cannot be reduced by more than 10.0% per year; for 2021-2023, a test price cannot be reduced by more than 15.0% per year. the process of data reporting and repricing will be repeated every three years for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (cdlts). the second data reporting period for cdlts will occur during the first quarter of 2020, and new clfs rates for cdlts will be established based on that data beginning in 2021, subject to the previously described phase-in limits for 2021-2023. the third data reporting period for cdlts will occur during the first quarter of 2023, and new clfs rates for cdlts will be established based on that data beginning in 2024. clfs rates for 2024 and subsequent periods will not be subject to phase-in limits. clfs rates for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests (adlts) will be updated annually. cms published its initial proposed clfs rates under pama for 2018-2020 on september 22, 2017. following a public comment period, cms made adjustments and published final clfs rates for 2018-2020 on november 17, 2017, with additional adjustments published on december 1, 2017. for 2018, the company realized a net reduction in reimbursement of approximately $70.0 million from all payers affected by the clfs. unless further implementation of pama is delayed or changed, an additional reduction of approximately $115 million is expected for 2019, from all payers affected by the clfs. the company supports the efforts of the american clinical laboratory association (acla) to work with congress on potential legislative reform of pama, which if enacted could reduce the negative impact of pama as implemented by cms. healthcare reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company, as an employer, to implement significant process and record-keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, as well as potential changes to the aca, the exact impact to employers, including the company, is uncertain. 35 index changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the biopharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for certain services that covance drug development (cdd) provides. cdd assists biopharmaceutical companies in navigating the regulatory drug approval process. changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that cdd has difficulty satisfying or that make its services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for its services. also, if government efforts to contain drug costs impact biopharmaceutical company profits from new drugs, or if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursement for biopharmaceutical products, some of cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. on december 13, 2016, the 21st century cures act was signed into law. this act provides funding designed to increase government spending on certain drug development initiatives; contains several provisions designed to help make the drug development process more streamlined and efficient; and allows the fda to increase staffing to support drug development, review and regulation. these provisions should be helpful to biopharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations (cros), including cdd, to the extent that they capitalize on the use of data, adaptive trial designs, real-world evidence, biomarkers and other development tools that are accepted by the fda. in addition, implementation of healthcare reform legislation that adds costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect r&amp;d expenditures by biopharmaceutical companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to cdd both in the u.s. and other countries. new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase cdd costs or limit service offerings through cdd. failure to comply with the regulations of drug regulatory agencies, such as the fda, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom (u.k.), the european medicines agency, the china food and drug administration, and the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency in japan, could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the operation of cdd's preclinical laboratory facilities and clinical trial operations must conform to good laboratory practice (glp) and good clinical practice (gcp), as applicable, as well as all other applicable standards and regulations, as further described in item 1 of part i of this report. the business operations of cdd's clinical and preclinical laboratories also require the import, export and use of medical devices, in vitro diagnostic devices, reagents, and human and animal biological products. such activities are subject to numerous applicable local and international regulations with which cdd must comply. if cdd does not comply, cdd could potentially be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies, including suspension of its ability to import or export to or from certain countries, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. additionally, certain cdd services and activities must conform to current good manufacturing practice (cgmp), as further described in item 1 of part i of this report. failure to maintain compliance with glp, gcp, or cgmp regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in warning or untitled letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, and civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against cdd, including suspension of its laboratory operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse effect on the company's revenues and profitability. as further described in item 1 of part i of this report, both lcd and cdd operate in highly competitive industries. the commercial laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by physicians, third-party payers and consumers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of significant consolidation in the commercial laboratory industry, larger commercial laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. lcd may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services, or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. competitors in the cro industry range from hundreds of smaller cros to a limited number of large cros with global capabilities. cdd's main competition consists of these small and large cros, as well as in-house departments of biopharmaceutical companies and, to a lesser extent, select universities and teaching hospitals. cdd's services have from time to time experienced periods of increased price competition that had an adverse effect on a segment's profitability and consolidated net revenues and net income. there is competition among cros for both customers and potential acquisition candidates. additionally, few barriers to entering the cro industry further increases possible new competition. 36 index these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness or profitability of lcd's and cdd's services, and could adversely affect the financial results of the company. failure to obtain and retain new customers, the loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in services or tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and/or create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to maintain and grow its business, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, a decrease in demand for the company's services from existing customers, or the loss of existing contracts, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse effect on the company's net revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of services, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community and the drug development industry, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of existing customers, an inability to gain new customers and a reduction in the company's business. continued and increased consolidation of mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems, physicians and other customers could adversely affect the company's business. many healthcare companies and providers, including mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems and physician practices are consolidating through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of transactions and collaborations. in addition to these more traditional horizontal mergers that involve entities that previously competed against each other, the healthcare industry is experiencing an increase in vertical mergers, which involve entities that previously did not offer competing goods or services. as the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services may become more intense, and vertical mergers may give those combined companies greater control over more aspects of healthcare, including increased bargaining power. this competition and increased customer bargaining power may adversely affect the price and volume of the company's services. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. lcd has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. lcd's inability to retain its existing relationships with those physicians as they become part of healthcare systems and networks and/or to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. services performed by lcd's former nutritional chemistry and food safety business and future developments of point-of-production testing could expose the company to various risks, including liability for errors and omissions in work conducted for lcd customers. until the sale of its covance food solutions (cfs) business effective august 1, 2018, lcd offered a range of product-development and product-integrity services to food and beverage manufacturers and retailers, industry organizations and academic institutions. these services exposed the company to many of the same, or similar, risks that are applicable to other business activities of the company, including with respect to the operations of its facilities and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. the agricultural, food, beverage and dietary supplement industries face increasing regulatory requirements, including regulations issued under the food safety modernization act. with these enhanced requirements on the company's customers, there is an increased risk that errors in or omissions from nutritional analysis and food safety tests previously conducted by the company for its former customers could result in liability for the company under customer contracts. lcd is also exploring the possibility of developing point-of-production testing for food safety, and these services could expose the company to similar risks. changes or disruption in services or supplies provided by third parties, including transportation, could adversely affect the company's business. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business. although the company has a significant proprietary network of ground and air transport capabilities, certain of the company's businesses are heavily reliant on third-party ground and air travel for transport of clinical trial and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people. a significant disruption to these travel systems, or the company's access to them, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. the company is also reliant on an extensive network of third-party suppliers and vendors of certain services and products, including for certain animal populations. disruptions to the continued supply of these services, products, or animal populations may arise from export/import restrictions or embargoes, political or economic instability, pressure from animal rights activists, adverse weather, natural disasters, transportation disruptions, or other causes. disruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. 37 index damage or disruption to the company's facilities could adversely affect the company's business. many of the company's facilities could be difficult to replace in a short period of time. any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities might impact the company's ability to provide service to customers and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company bears financial risk for contracts that, for reasons beyond the company's control, may be underpriced, subject to cost overruns, delayed, or terminated or reduced in scope. the company has many contracts that are structured as fixed-price for fixed-contracted services or fee-for-service with a cap. the company bears the financial risk if these contracts are underpriced or if contract costs exceed estimates. such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. many of cdd's contracts, in particular, provide for services on a fixed-price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, including: failure of products to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired results of the products; insufficient clinical trial subject enrollment; insufficient investigator recruitment; a customer's decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study; and cdd's failure to perform its duties properly under the contract. although its contracts often entitle it to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned up to the time of termination, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss, delay or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect cdd. contract research services in the drug development industry create liability risks. in contracting to work on drug development trials and studies, cdd faces a range of potential liabilities, including: errors or omissions that create harm to clinical trial subjects during a trial or to consumers of a drug after the trial is completed and regulatory approval of the drug has been granted; general risks associated with clinical pharmacology facilities, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of clinical pharmacology physicians; risks that animals in cdd's breeding facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in cdd's business policies, including those for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study or may delay the entry of a drug to the market. cdd contracts with physicians, also referred to as investigators, to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on clinical trial subjects. these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to clinical trial subjects resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators. while cdd endeavors to include in its contracts provisions entitling it to be indemnified and entitling it to a limitation of liability, these provisions do not uniformly protect cdd against liability arising from certain of its own actions. cdd could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision, or in the event that a party which must indemnify it does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or in the event that cdd is not successful in limiting its liability or in the event that the damages and costs exceed cdd's insurance coverage. there can be no assurance that cdd will be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage on acceptable terms. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal actions related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, contract disputes, data and privacy issues, professional liability and employee-related matters. the company may also receive inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies, including medicare or medicaid payers, requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities, billing and pricing arrangements, or privacy practices that are brought to their attention through audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. 38 index the company's quarterly operating results may vary. the company's operating results, particularly for cdd, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by factors over which the company has little control, such as: changes in the general global economy; exchange rate fluctuations; the commencement, completion, delay or cancellation of large projects or groups of projects; the progress of ongoing projects; the timing of and charges associated with completed acquisitions or other events; and changes in the mix of the company's services. the company believes that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. while fluctuations in the company's quarterly operating results could negatively or positively affect the market price of the company's common stock, these fluctuations may not be related to the company's future overall operating performance. the failure to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to the company's intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company. many of the company's services, products and processes rely on intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. in some cases, that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to the company, sometimes exclusively. the value of the company's intellectual property relies in part on the company's ability to maintain its proprietary rights to such intellectual property. if the company is unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to its intellectual property, if it is unable to prevent attempted infringement against its intellectual property, or if it is unable to defend against claims that it is infringing on another party's intellectual property, the company could be adversely affected. these adverse effects could include the company having to abandon, alter and/or delay the deployment of products, services or processes that rely on such intellectual property; having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that the company seeks to use; and having to pay damages, fines, court costs and attorney's fees in connection with intellectual property litigation. cdd's revenues depend on the biopharmaceutical industry. cdd's revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the biopharmaceutical industry in r&amp;d. in some instances, biopharmaceutical companies are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their r&amp;d projects. biopharmaceutical companies are also reliant on reimbursement for their products from government programs and commercial payers. accordingly, economic factors and industry trends affecting cdd's customers in these industries may also affect cdd. if these companies were to reduce the number of r&amp;d projects they conduct or outsource, whether through the inability to raise capital, reductions in reimbursement from governmental programs or commercial payers, industry trends, economic conditions or otherwise, cdd could be materially adversely affected. actions of animal rights activists may have an adverse effect on the company. cdd's preclinical services utilize animals in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs. such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the u.s., europe, japan and other countries. cdd also breeds and sells animals for biomedical research. acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have an adverse effect on the company. animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage cdd's inventory, harm its reputation, result in decreased sales of research products or result in other liability. it is important that research products be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, cause loss of animals in cdd's inventory, result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or result in other losses. such results could harm cdd's reputation or have an adverse effect on cdd's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. failure to conduct animal research in compliance with animal welfare laws and regulations could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the conduct of animal research at cdd's facilities must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which those activities are conducted. these laws and regulations include the u.s animal welfare act (awa), which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals for research in the u.s. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the u.s. department of agriculture (usda). the awa establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care and recordkeeping. similar laws and regulations apply in other jurisdictions in which cdd conducts animal research, including the european union (e.u.) and china. cdd complies with licensing and registration requirement standards 39 index set by these laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it conducts animal research. if an enforcement agency determines that cdd's equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. for noncompliance, the agency may take action against cdd that may include fines, suspension and/or revocation of animal research licenses, or confiscation of research animals. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories and drug development facilities could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies and in drug development will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform commercial laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company's revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. unionization of employees, union strikes, work stoppages or failure to comply with labor or employment laws could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to a limited number of collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and is subject to employment and labor laws and unionization activity in the u.s. and other countries in which it conducts business. disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements, potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalties. if any of these events were to occur, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, or changes in labor or employment laws, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. also, the company may incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and enforcement actions if the company fails to comply with legal requirements affecting its workforce and labor practices, including laws and regulations relating to wage and hour practices and unlawful workplace harassment and discrimination. a significant increase in lcd's or cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including its cash flow, by increasing its bad debt or decreasing its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers, including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, lcd has experienced an increase in patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans that continue to increase patient deductibles, coinsurance and copayments, or implement restrictive coverage policies that can further increase patient costs. lcd expects this trend to continue. a material increase in lcd's days sales outstanding level could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially increasing its bad debt rate and decreasing its cash flows. although cdd does not face the same level of complexity in its billing processes, it could also experience delays in billing or collection, and a material increase in cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially decreasing its cash flows. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of updates or enhancements to those systems could significantly increase testing turnaround time or delay billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results or drug development data in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. 40 index hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement new systems or system enhancements to existing systems, and cyber security breaches may harm the company. the company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. a failure of the network or data-gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, customer orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. while certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, there currently are not redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide information technology capacity in the event of a system failure. despite any precautions the company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at the company's various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to customers. in addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. in the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server-hosting services. such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to customers. additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, or improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the company's reputation and harm the business. security breaches and unauthorized access to the company's or its customers' data could harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business. the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience attempts by computer programmers and hackers to attack and penetrate the company's layered security controls, like the 2018 ransomware attack. these attempts, if successful, could result in the misappropriation or compromise of personal information or proprietary or confidential information stored within the company's systems, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. external actors may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the company's systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments through illegal electronic spamming, phishing, spear phishing, or other tactics. although the company has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the company may be unable to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the company's remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. this could also impact the cost and availability of cyber insurance to the company. breaches of the company's security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of personal, proprietary or confidential information about the company or its customers or other third-parties could expose customers' private information. such breaches could expose customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose the company or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for the company, damage the company's brand and reputation or otherwise harm the company's business. any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as adverse weather and earthquakes, acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. natural disasters may result in a temporary decline of volumes in both segments. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's ability to efficiently commence studies, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. significant weather conditions can affect customer operations and thereby impact testing volume. in addition, long-term disruptions in the infrastructure caused by disease pandemics, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism (particularly involving locations in which the company has operations) could adversely affect business operations. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, drug development services, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, biopharmaceutical companies and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services, as well as the ability of customers to pay for services rendered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. 41 index foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s., and cdd derives a significant portion of its net revenues from international operations. since the company's consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on reported results. in addition, cdd may incur costs in one currency related to its services or products for which it is paid in a different currency. as a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect cdd's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the company's international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the company's international operations expose it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, changes in reimbursement by foreign governments for services provided by the company; compliance with export controls and trade regulations; changes in tax policies or other foreign laws; compliance with foreign labor and employee relations laws and regulations; restrictions on currency repatriation; judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights; countries that do not have clear or well-established laws and regulations concerning issues relating to commercial laboratory testing or drug development services; countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights; and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. expanded international operations may increase the company's exposure to liabilities under the anti-corruption laws. anti-corruption laws in the countries where the company conducts business, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa), u.k. bribery act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery including improperly offering, promising, paying or authorizing the giving of anything of value to individuals or entities for the purpose of corruptly obtaining or retaining business. the company operates in some parts of the world where corruption may be common and where anti-corruption laws may conflict to some degree with local customs and practices. the company maintains an anti-corruption program including policies, procedures and training and safeguards in the engagement and management of third parties acting on the company's behalf. despite these safeguards, the company cannot guarantee protection from corrupt acts committed by employees or third parties associated with the company. violations or allegations of violations of anti-corruption laws could have a significant adverse effect on the business or results of operations. changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such may have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the company. u.s. and foreign governments continue to review, reform and modify tax laws, including with respect to the organisation for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting initiative. changes in tax laws and regulations could result in material changes to the domestic and foreign taxes that the company is required to provide for and pay. in addition, the company is subject to regular audits with respect to its various tax returns and processes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. errors or omissions in tax returns, process failures or differences in interpretation of tax laws by tax authorities and the company may lead to litigation, payments of additional taxes, penalties and interest. on december 22, 2017, the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (tcja) was passed into law. the tcja has given rise to significant one-time and ongoing changes to the taxes recognized and paid by the company, and the full impact of the changes may only become fully understood over time. a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse effect on the company's business objectives and its net revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities and enhance therapeutic expertise, enhance esoteric testing and global drug development capabilities, and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2014, the company has invested net cash of approximately $6.4 billion and equity of $1.8 billion in strategic business acquisitions. however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration 42 index of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; coordination of geographically separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management's attention from the day-to-day business of the company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to net revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect the company's liquidity, results of operations and business. at december 31, 2018, indebtedness on the company's outstanding senior notes totaled approximately $5,500.0 million in aggregate principal. the company is also a party to credit agreements relating to a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a 2017 term loan with a balance of $527.0 million as of december 31, 2018. under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment-grade-rated borrowers, and the company is required to maintain a leverage ratio within certain limits. the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect its business. in particular, it could increase the company's vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing, and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions. the company may also enter into additional transactions or credit facilities, including other long-term debt, which may increase its indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon the business. in addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate the company's debt based on a number of factors. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets. global economic conditions and government and regulatory changes, including, but not limited to, the u.k.'s pending exit from the european union (e.u.) could adversely impact the company's business and results of operations. the company could be adversely impacted due to the consequences of changes in the economy, governments or regulations across the globe. in june 2016, a majority of voters in the u.k. elected to withdraw from the e.u. (often referred to as brexit) in a national referendum. although the referendum was advisory, the current u.k. government is abiding by the referendum and is in negotiations to withdraw from the e.u. in the near future. the terms of any withdrawal and future relations between the e.u. and the u.k. are not yet determined. while it appears that e.u. laws and regulations will continue to apply in the u.k. until the withdrawal is completed, it is difficult to anticipate how the clinical trial landscape in the u.k. might change in the next several years. this type of development or other government or regulatory change could depress economic activity, which could adversely impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. this could include long-term volatility in the currency markets and long-term detrimental effects on the value of affected currencies. the company's uses of financial instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations could expose it to risks and financial losses that may adversely affect the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. to reduce the company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and currency exchange fluctuations, it has entered into, and in the future may enter into for these or other purposes, financial swaps, or hedging arrangements, with various financial counterparties. in addition to any risks related to the counterparties, there can be no assurances that the company's hedging activity will be effective in insulating it from the risks associated with the underlying transactions, that the company would not have been better off without entering into these hedges, or that the company will not have to pay additional amounts upon settlement. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 69 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk (in millions) market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. in the ordinary course of business, the company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the company regularly evaluates the exposure to such changes. the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign currency exchange rates approximately 13.6% of the company's revenues for the year ended december 31, 2018 and approximately 10.9% of those for the year ended 2017 were denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar. the company's financial statements are reported in u.s. dollars (usd) and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into u.s. dollars for purposes of reporting the company's consolidated financial results. in both 2018 and 2017, the most significant currency exchange rate exposures were to the canadian dollar, swiss franc, euro and british pound. excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10% in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to u.s. dollars would have impacted income before income taxes for 2018 by approximately $4.6. gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity were $(176.6) and $265.1 at december 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively. the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. the company earns revenue from service contracts over a period of several months and, in some cases, over a period of several years. accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect the company's profitability with respect to such 69 index contracts. the company is also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. the company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in some of its contracts with customers, or it may hedge transaction risk with foreign currency forward contracts. at december 31, 2018, the company had 34 open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2019 with a notional value totaling approximately $487.9. at december 31, 2017, the company had 26 open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2018 with a notional value totaling approximately $360.5. the company is party to six usd to swiss franc cross-currency swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0, maturing in 2022 and 2025, as a hedge against the impact of foreign exchange movements on its net investment in a swiss franc functional currency subsidiary. interest rates some of the company's debt is subject to interest at variable rates. as a result, fluctuations in interest rates affect the company's financial results. the company attempts to manage interest rate risk and overall borrowing costs through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt including the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. borrowings under the company's term loan credit facilities and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. as of december 31, 2018, and 2017, the company had approximately $ 0.0 and $ 72.0 , respectively, of unhedged variable rate debt under the 2014 term loan credit facility and $527.1 and $750.0 , respectively, under the 2017 term loan credit facility. each quarter-point increase or decrease in the variable rate would result in the company's interest expense changing by approximately $2.1 per year for the company's unhedged variable rate debt. during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for its 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month london interbank offered rate ( libor) plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long-term debt. the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under authoritative guidance in connection with accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero-coupon subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero-coupon subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero-coupon subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor's ratings services is bb- or lower.risk factors 31 risk factors investors should carefully consider all of the information set forth in this report, including the following risk factors, before deciding to invest in any of the company's securities. the risks below are not the only ones that the company faces. additional risks not presently known to the company, or that it presently deems immaterial, may also negatively impact the company. the company's business, consolidated financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability, reputation or cash flows could be materially impacted by any of these factors. this report also includes forward-looking statements that involve risks or uncertainties. the company's results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere. see forward-looking statements in item 7. changes in payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulations or approvals, or changes in other laws, regulations or policies in the united states (u.s.), may adversely affect u.s. governmental and third-party coverage or reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material adverse effect upon the company. u.s. and state government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including managed care organizations (mcos), have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. the first phase of reductions pursuant to the protecting access to medicare act (pama) came into effect on january 1, 2018, and will continue annually subject to certain phase-in limits through 2025, and without limitations for subsequent periods. further reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization, diagnosis code and other claims edits, or a physician or qualified practitioner's signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for pathology services performed by labcorp diagnostics (lcd) is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in third-party payer regulations, policies, or laboratory benefit or utilization management programs may have a material adverse effect on lcd's business. actions by federal and state agencies regulating insurance, including healthcare exchanges, or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon lcd's business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from government programs if it violates anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state, and local levels in the u.s. and other countries where it operates. the company's failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians, hospitals, and health systems could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories. while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. this risk includes, but is not limited to, the potential that government enforcement 31 index authorities may take a contrary position with respect to the eliminating kickbacks in recovery act (ekra), given its recent passage and lack of associated regulations to clarify or add exceptions. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company's reputation and adversely affect important business relationships. the company's business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or interpretations of, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967, and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 (clia), or those of medicare, medicaid or other national, state or local agencies in the u.s. and other countries where the company operates laboratories. the commercial laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive u.s. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the u.s. by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the company also operates laboratories outside of the u.s. and is subject to laws governing its laboratory operations in the other countries where it operates. applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the company's business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company, which may be costly. u.s. food and drug administration (fda) regulation of diagnostic products and increased fda regulation of laboratory-developed tests (ldts) could result in increased costs and the imposition of fines or penalties, and could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the fda has regulatory responsibility for instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. the fda enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products. lcd's point-of-care testing devices are subject to regulation by the fda. since the 1990s, the fda has asserted that it has authority to regulate ldts as medical devices, but has exercised enforcement discretion to refrain from systematic regulation of ldts. in 2014, the fda issued draft guidance describing how it intended to discontinue its enforcement discretion policy and begin regulating ldts as medical devices; however, that draft guidance has not been finalized, and fda has instead continued its enforcement discretion policy and has indicated that it intends to work with congress to enact comprehensive legislative preform of diagnostics oversight. as such, ldts developed by high complexity clinical laboratories are currently generally offered as services to health care providers under the clia regulatory framework administered by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) of the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs), without the requirement for fda clearance or approval. there are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general fda oversight of clinical laboratories and ldts. the outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. on february 20, 2020, the fda issued a statement with a table of pharmacogenetic associations setting forth certain gene-drug interactions that the agency has determined are supported by the scientific literature to help ensure that claims being made for pharmacogenetic tests are grounded in sound science, thereby reducing the risk of enforcement actions with respect to ldts offering claims consistent with the table. the fda noted that while it is committed to work with congress on new comprehensive diagnostic oversight reform legislation, it could still take enforcement actions under the current medical device framework regarding diagnostic claims the agency determines not to be sufficiently supported. even without issuance of a finalized ldt oversight framework, in light of the april 4, 2019, fda warning letter issued to inova genomics laboratory related to certain ldts that inova offered, as well as the february 2020 pharmacogenetics statement, there may be an increased risk of fda enforcement actions for laboratory tests offered by companies without fda clearance or approval. current fda regulation of the company's diagnostic products and potential future increased regulation of the company's ldts could result in increased costs and administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, including warning letters, fines, penalties, product suspensions, product recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. failure to comply with u.s., state, local or international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the u.s. occupational safety and health administration act and the u.s. needlestick safety and prevention act, could result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. 32 index as previously discussed in item 1 of part i of this report, the company is subject to licensing and regulation under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions that would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company that may be costly. failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties and damage to the company's reputation with customers and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information, it could be subject to monetary fines, civil penalties or criminal sanctions. in the u.s., the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa) privacy and security regulations, including the expanded requirements under u.s. health information technology for economic and clinical health act (hitech), establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (phi), by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of phi. hipaa restricts the company's ability to use or disclose phi, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. hipaa and hitech provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which the use and disclosure of phi are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including, but not limited to, treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company's services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of phi; the content of notices of privacy practices for phi; administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive phi; and the protection of computing systems maintaining electronic phi. the company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with the hipaa privacy and security requirements as applicable. the privacy and security regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, the company is required to comply with both additional federal privacy and security regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. in addition, federal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of patient information may be subject to enforcement and interpretations by various governmental authorities and courts, resulting in complex compliance issues. for example, the company could incur damages under state laws pursuant to an action brought by a private party for the wrongful use or disclosure of health information or other personal information. on june 28, 2018, the california legislature passed the california consumer privacy act (ccpa), which was effective january 1, 2020. the ccpa created new transparency requirements and granted california residents several new rights with regard their personal information. failure to comply with the ccpa may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. the company implemented processes to manage compliance with the ccpa. in addition, california residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. these claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. the company may also be required to comply with the data privacy and security laws of other countries in which it operates or with which it transfers and receives data. for example, the european union's (eu) general data protection regulation (gdpr), which took effect may 25, 2018, created a range of new compliance obligations for subject companies and imposes penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of 20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. the company has established processes and frameworks to manage compliance with the gdpr, but there remains uncertainty as to how eu supervisory authorities will interpret and enforce the regulation. the costs of compliance with the gdpr could be significant. potential fines and penalties in the event of a violation of the gdpr could have a material adverse effect on the company's business and operations. in addition, similar data protection regulations addressing access, use, disclosure and transfer of personal data have been enacted or updated in countries where the company does business, including in asia, latin america, canada and europe. the company expects to make changes to its business practices and to incur additional costs associated with compliance with these evolving and complex regulations. failure to maintain the security of customer-related information or compliance with security requirements could damage the company's reputation with customers, cause it to incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and enforcement actions. 33 index the company receives and stores certain personal and financial information about its customers. in addition, the company depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including information permitting cashless payments. the company also works with third-party service providers and vendors that provide technology systems and services that are used in connection with the receipt, storage, and transmission of customer personal and financial information. a compromise in the company's security systems, or those of the company's third party service providers and vendors, that results in customer personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons or the company's or third party's failure to comply with security requirements for financial transactions could adversely affect the company's reputation with its customers and others, as well as the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. it could also result in litigation against the company and the imposition of fines and penalties. for example, in connection with the amca incident the company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs, and the company is involved in pending and threatened litigation, as well as various government and regulatory inquiries and processes. for additional information about the amca incident, see note 16 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business, and depends on them to comply with applicable laws and regulations. additionally, any breaches of the information technology systems of third parties could have a material adverse effect on the company's operations. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business, including supplies, ground and air transport of clinical and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people, among other services. third parties that provide services to the company are subject to similar risks related to security of customer-related information and compliance with u.s., state, local, or international environmental, health and safety, and privacy and security laws and regulations as the company. any failure by third parties to comply with applicable laws, or any failure of third parties to provide services more generally, could have a material impact on the company, whether because of the loss of the ability to receive services from the third parties, legal liability of the company for the actions or inactions of third parties, or otherwise. in addition, third parties to whom the company outsources certain services or functions may process personal data, or other confidential information of the company. a breach or attack affecting these third parties could also harm the company's business, results of operations and reputation. discontinuation or recalls of existing testing products; failure to develop or acquire licenses for new or improved testing technologies; or the company's customers using new technologies to perform their own tests could adversely affect the company's business. from time to time, manufacturers discontinue or recall reagents, test kits or instruments used by the company to perform laboratory testing. such discontinuations or recalls could adversely affect the company's costs, testing volume and revenue. the commercial laboratory industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company's success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to develop, acquire or license new and improved technologies on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements, and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development (r&amp;d) costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing operations, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company's competition, and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective technologies such as point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers (including physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives, generally referred to herein as physicians) in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company's customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and the utilization of certain tests offered by the company and negatively impact its revenues. currently, most commercial laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia makes it impractical for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia and may be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories, and it has taken responsibility from the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could 34 index lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices or by patients at home, which could affect the company's market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. healthcare reform and changes to related products (e.g., health insurance exchanges), changes in government payment and reimbursement systems, or changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated reimbursement mechanisms and evolving delivery models, could have a material adverse effect on the company's revenues, profitability and cash flow. lcd's testing services are billed to mcos, medicare, medicaid, physicians and physician groups, hospitals, patients and employer groups. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person who ordered the test. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and mcos could have an adverse effect on the company's revenues. the company serves many mcos. these organizations have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of their products. some mcos contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of rates. other mcos adopt broader networks with generally uniform fee structures for participating clinical laboratories. in some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories, while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. mcos may also offer managed medicare or managed medicaid plans. in addition, some mcos use capitation rates to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the clinical laboratory receives a per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of laboratory tests provided to mco members during the month, regardless of the number of tests performed. capitation shifts the risk of increased test utilization (and the underlying mix of testing services) to the commercial laboratory provider. the company makes significant efforts to obtain adequate compensation for its services in its capitated arrangements. for the year ended december 31, 2019, such capitated contracts accounted for approximately $298.0 million, or 4.3%, of lcd's revenues. the company's ability to attract and retain mcos is critical given the impact of healthcare reform, related products and expanded coverage (e.g. health insurance exchanges and medicaid expansion) and evolving value-based care and risk-based reimbursement delivery models (e.g., accountable care organizations (acos) and independent physician associations (ipas)). a portion of the managed care fee-for-service revenues is collectible from patients in the form of deductibles, coinsurance and copayments. as patient cost-sharing has been increasing, the company's collections may be adversely impacted. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including commercial laboratory services. measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the commercial laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicare plans has increased. the percentage of medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed medicaid plans has also increased, and is expected to continue to increase; however, changes to, or repeal of, the patient protection and affordable care act (aca) may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services, as well as administrative requirements, in ways that are currently unpredictable. further healthcare reform could adversely affect laboratory reimbursement from medicare, medicaid or commercial carriers. the company also experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of new molecular pathology codes among various payers, including medicaid, medicare and commercial carriers. while some delays were expected, several non-commercial payers required an extended period of time to price key molecular codes, and a number of those payers, mostly government entities, indicated that they would no longer pay for tests that they had previously covered. these issues (particularly payer policy changes) and changes in coverage had a negative impact on revenue, revenue per requisition, and margins and cash flows beginning in 2014, and are expected to have a continuing negative impact. similarly, the clinical laboratory fee schedule (clfs) coding and billing changes related to toxicology and other procedures were implemented in 2016 and 2017. the company experienced delays in the pricing and implementation of the new toxicology codes; however, the company largely overcame issues related to price and margins through direct negotiation with the associated payers. limited coding and billing changes related to other procedure types were implemented in 2018 and 2019. while limited changes are expected to be implemented in 2020, the company expects some delays in pricing and implementation of these new codes. in addition, some mcos are implementing, directly or through third parties, various types of laboratory benefit management programs that may include lab networks, utilization management tools (such as prior authorization and/or prior notification), and claims edits, which may impact coverage or reimbursement for commercial laboratory tests. some of these programs address commercial laboratory testing broadly, while others are focused on certain types of testing such as molecular, genetic and toxicology testing. the company expects the efforts to impose reduced reimbursement, more stringent payment policies, and utilization and cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if lcd cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for 35 index its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume, and/or introducing new services and procedures, it could have a material adverse effect on the company's revenues, profitability and cash flows. in 2014, congress passed pama, requiring medicare to change the way payment rates are calculated for tests paid under the clfs, and to base the payment on the weighted median of rates paid by private payers. on june 23, 2016, cms issued a final rule to implement pama that required applicable laboratories, including lcd, to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to cms during the first quarter of 2017. cms exercised enforcement discretion to permit reporting for an additional 60 days, through may 30, 2017. cms used that private market data to calculate weighted median prices for each test (based on applicable current procedural technology (cpt) codes) to represent the new clfs rates beginning in 2018, subject to certain phase-in limits, which were revised by congress in 2019. for 2018-2020, a test price cannot be reduced by more than 10.0% per year; for 2021-2023, a test price cannot be reduced by more than 15.0% per year. the process of data reporting and repricing will be repeated every three years for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests (cdlts) beginning in 2021. under the current law, the second data reporting period for cdlts will occur during the first quarter of 2021 (based on data collected in 2019), and new clfs rates for cdlts will be established based on that data beginning in 2022, subject to the previously described phase-in limits for 2022-2023. the third data reporting period for cdlts will occur during the first quarter of 2024, and new clfs rates for cdlts will be established based on that data beginning in 2025. clfs rates for 2024 and subsequent periods will not be subject to phase-in limits. clfs rates for advanced diagnostic laboratory tests (adlts) will be updated annually. cms published its initial proposed clfs rates under pama for 2018-2020 on september 22, 2017. following a public comment period, cms made adjustments and published final clfs rates for 2018-2020 on november 17, 2017, with additional adjustments published on december 1, 2017. for 2019, the company realized a net reduction in reimbursement of approximately $107.0 million from all payers affected by the clfs (approximately $70.0 million in 2018). unless implementation of pama is further delayed or changed, an additional reduction of approximately $90.0 million is expected for 2020, from all payers affected by the clfs. healthcare reform legislation also contains numerous regulations that will require the company, as an employer, to implement significant process and record-keeping changes to be in compliance. these changes increase the cost of providing healthcare coverage to employees and their families. given the limited release of regulations to guide compliance, as well as potential changes to the aca, the exact impact to employers, including the company, is uncertain. changes in government regulation or in practices relating to the biopharmaceutical industry could decrease the need for certain services that covance drug development (cdd) provides. cdd assists biopharmaceutical companies in navigating the regulatory drug approval process. changes in regulations such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that cdd has difficulty satisfying or that make its services less competitive, could eliminate or substantially reduce the demand for its services. also, if government efforts to contain drug costs impact biopharmaceutical company profits from new drugs, or if health insurers were to change their practices with respect to reimbursement for biopharmaceutical products, some of cdd's customers may spend less, or reduce their growth in spending on r&amp;d. on december 13, 2016, the 21st century cures act was signed into law. this act provides funding designed to increase government spending on certain drug development initiatives; contains several provisions designed to help make the drug development process more streamlined and efficient; and allows the fda to increase staffing to support drug development, review and regulation. these provisions should be helpful to biopharmaceutical companies and contract research organizations (cros), including cdd, to the extent that they capitalize on the use of data, adaptive trial designs, real-world evidence, biomarkers and other development tools that are accepted by the fda. in addition, implementation of healthcare reform legislation that adds costs could limit the profits that can be made from the development of new drugs. this could adversely affect r&amp;d expenditures by biopharmaceutical companies, which could in turn decrease the business opportunities available to cdd both in the u.s. and other countries. new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase cdd costs or limit service offerings through cdd. failure to comply with the regulations of drug regulatory agencies, such as the fda, the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency in the united kingdom (u.k.), the european medicines agency, the national medical products administration in china (nmpa), and the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency in japan, could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the operation of cdd's preclinical laboratory facilities and clinical trial operations must conform to good laboratory practice (glp) and good clinical practice (gcp), as applicable, as well as all other applicable standards and regulations, as further described in item 1 of part i of this report. the business operations of cdd's clinical and preclinical laboratories also require the import, export and use of medical devices, in vitro diagnostic devices, reagents, and human and animal biological products. such activities are subject to numerous applicable local and international regulations with which cdd must comply. if cdd does not comply, cdd could potentially be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies, including suspension of its ability to conduct preclinical and clinical studies, and to import or export to or from certain countries, which could have a material adverse 36 index effect upon the company. additionally, certain cdd services and activities must conform to current good manufacturing practice gmp, as further described in item 1 of part i of this report. failure to maintain compliance with glp, gcp, or gmp regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in warning or untitled letters, fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, and civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against cdd, including suspension of its laboratory operations, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse effect on the company's revenues and profitability. as further described in item 1 of part i of this report, both lcd and cdd operate in highly competitive industries. the commercial laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is often one of the most significant factors used by physicians, third-party payers and consumers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of significant consolidation in the commercial laboratory industry, larger commercial laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. lcd may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. the company may also face increased competition from companies that do not comply with existing laws or regulations or otherwise disregard compliance standards in the industry. additionally, the company may also face changes in fee schedules, competitive bidding for laboratory services, or other actions or pressures reducing payment schedules as a result of increased or additional competition. competitors in the cro industry range from hundreds of smaller cros to a limited number of large cros with global capabilities. cdd's main competition consists of these small and large cros, as well as in-house departments of biopharmaceutical companies and, to a lesser extent, select universities and teaching hospitals. cdd's services have from time to time experienced periods of increased price competition that had an adverse effect on a segment's profitability and consolidated revenues and net income. there is competition among cros for both customers and potential acquisition candidates. additionally, few barriers to entering the cro industry further increases possible new competition. these competitive pressures may affect the attractiveness or profitability of lcd's and cdd's services, and could adversely affect the financial results of the company. failure to obtain and retain new customers, the loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in services or tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, or the inability to retain existing and/or create new relationships with health systems could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business. to maintain and grow its business, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and business partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, a decrease in demand for the company's services from existing customers, or the loss of existing contracts, without offsetting growth in its customer base, could impact the company's ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse effect on the company's revenues and profitability. the company competes primarily on the basis of the quality of services, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community and the drug development industry, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company's failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of existing customers, an inability to gain new customers and a reduction in the company's business. continued and increased consolidation of mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems, physicians and other customers could adversely affect the company's business. many healthcare companies and providers, including mcos, biopharmaceutical companies, health systems and physician practices are consolidating through mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of transactions and collaborations. in addition to these more traditional horizontal mergers that involve entities that previously competed against each other, the healthcare industry is experiencing an increase in vertical mergers, which involve entities that previously did not offer competing goods or services. as the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services may become more intense, and vertical mergers may give those combined companies greater control over more aspects of healthcare, including increased bargaining power. this competition and increased customer bargaining power may adversely affect the price and volume of the company's services. in addition, as the broader healthcare industry trend of consolidation continues, including the acquisition of physician practices by health systems, relationships with hospital-based health systems and integrated delivery networks are becoming more important. lcd has a well-established base of relationships with those systems and networks, including collaborative agreements. lcd's inability to retain its existing relationships with those physicians as they become part of healthcare systems and networks and/or to create new relationships could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. 37 index changes or disruption in services or supplies provided by third parties, including transportation, could adversely affect the company's business. the company depends on third parties to provide services critical to the company's business. although the company has a significant proprietary network of ground and air transport capabilities, certain of the company's businesses are heavily reliant on third-party ground and air travel for transport of clinical trial and diagnostic testing supplies and specimens, research products, and people. a significant disruption to these travel systems, or the company's access to them, could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. the company is also reliant on an extensive network of third-party suppliers and vendors of certain services and products, including for certain animal populations. disruptions to the continued supply of these services, products, or animal populations may arise from export/import restrictions or embargoes, political or economic instability, pressure from animal rights activists, adverse weather, natural disasters, public health crises, transportation disruptions, or other causes, as well as from termination of relationships with suppliers or vendors for their failure to follow the company's performance standards and requirements. disruption of supply could have a material adverse effect on the company's business. damage or disruption to the company's facilities could adversely affect the company's business. many of the company's facilities could be difficult to replace in a short period of time. any event that causes a disruption of the operation of these facilities might impact the company's ability to provide service to customers and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company bears financial risk for contracts that, for reasons beyond the company's control, may be underpriced, subject to cost overruns, delayed, or terminated or reduced in scope. the company has many contracts that are structured as fixed-price for fixed-contracted services or fee-for-service with a cap. the company bears the financial risk if these contracts are underpriced or if contract costs exceed estimates. such underpricing or significant cost overruns could have an adverse effect on the company's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. many of cdd's contracts, in particular, provide for services on a fixed-price or fee-for-service with a cap basis and they may be terminated or reduced in scope either immediately or upon notice. cancellations may occur for a variety of reasons, including: failure of products to satisfy safety requirements; unexpected or undesired results of the products; insufficient clinical trial subject enrollment; insufficient investigator recruitment; a customer's decision to terminate the development of a product or to end a particular study; and cdd's failure to perform its duties properly under the contract. although its contracts often entitle it to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned up to the time of termination, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss, delay or conclusion of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect cdd. contract research services in the drug development industry create liability risks. in contracting to work on drug development trials and studies, cdd faces a range of potential liabilities, including: errors or omissions that create harm to clinical trial subjects during a trial or to consumers of a drug after the trial is completed and regulatory approval of the drug has been granted; general risks associated with clinical pharmacology facilities, including negative consequences from the administration of drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of clinical pharmacology physicians; risks that animals in cdd's facilities may be infected with diseases that may be harmful and even lethal to themselves and humans despite preventive measures contained in cdd's business policies, including those for the quarantine and handling of imported animals; and errors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study or may delay the entry of a drug to the market. cdd contracts with physicians, also referred to as investigators, to conduct the clinical trials to test new drugs on clinical trial subjects. these tests can create a risk of liability for personal injury or death to clinical trial subjects resulting from negative reactions to the drugs administered or from professional malpractice by third party investigators. while cdd endeavors to include in its contracts provisions entitling it to be indemnified and entitling it to a limitation of liability, these provisions are not always successfully obtained and, even if obtained, do not uniformly protect cdd against liability arising from certain of its own actions. cdd could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is not covered by a contractual indemnification provision, or in the event that a party which must indemnify it does not fulfill its indemnification obligations, or in the event that cdd is not successful in limiting its liability 38 index or in the event that the damages and costs exceed cdd's insurance coverage. cdd may also be required to agree to contract provisions with clinical trial sites or its customers related to the conduct of clinical trials, and cdd could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to indemnify a site or customer against claims pursuant to such contract terms. there can be no assurance that cdd will be able to maintain sufficient insurance coverage on acceptable terms. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal actions related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, contract disputes, data and privacy issues, professional liability and employee-related matters. the company may also receive inquiries and requests for information from governmental agencies and bodies, including medicare or medicaid payers, requesting comment and/or information on allegations of billing irregularities, billing and pricing arrangements, or privacy practices that are brought to their attention through audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company's reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. the company's quarterly operating results may vary. the company's operating results, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are influenced by factors over which the company has little control, such as: changes in the general global economy; exchange rate fluctuations; the commencement, completion, delay or cancellation of large projects or contracts or groups of projects; the progress of ongoing projects; weather; the timing of and charges associated with completed acquisitions or other events; and changes in the mix of the company's services. the company believes that operating results for any particular quarter are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future results. while fluctuations in the company's quarterly operating results could negatively or positively affect the market price of the company's common stock, these fluctuations may not be related to the company's future overall operating performance. the failure to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights and defend against challenges to the company's intellectual property rights could adversely affect the company. many of the company's services, products and processes rely on intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. in some cases, that intellectual property is owned by another party and licensed to the company, sometimes exclusively. the value of the company's intellectual property relies in part on the company's ability to maintain its proprietary rights to such intellectual property. if the company is unable to obtain or maintain the proprietary rights to its intellectual property, if it is unable to prevent attempted infringement against its intellectual property, or if it is unable to defend against claims that it is infringing on another party's intellectual property, the company could be adversely affected. these adverse effects could include the company having to abandon, alter and/or delay the deployment of products, services or processes that rely on such intellectual property; having to procure and pay for licenses from the holders of intellectual property rights that the company seeks to use; and having to pay damages, fines, court costs and attorney's fees in connection with intellectual property litigation. cdd's revenues depend on the biopharmaceutical industry. cdd's revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the biopharmaceutical industry in r&amp;d. in some instances, biopharmaceutical companies are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their r&amp;d projects. biopharmaceutical companies are also reliant on reimbursement for their products from government programs and commercial payers. accordingly, economic factors and industry trends affecting cdd's customers in these industries may also affect cdd. if these companies were to reduce the number of r&amp;d projects they conduct or outsource, whether through the inability to raise capital, reductions in reimbursement from governmental programs or commercial payers, industry trends, economic conditions or otherwise, cdd could be materially adversely affected. actions of animal rights activists may have an adverse effect on the company. cdd's preclinical services utilize animals in preclinical testing of the safety and efficacy of drugs. such activities are required for the development of new medicines and medical devices under regulatory regimes in the u.s., europe, japan and other countries. acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in drug development could have an adverse effect on the company. animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage cdd's inventory, harm its reputation, result in decreased sales of research products or result in other liability. 39 index it is important that research products be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. the presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, cause loss of animals in cdd's inventory, result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or result in other losses. such results could harm cdd's reputation or have an adverse effect on cdd's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. failure to conduct animal research in compliance with animal welfare laws and regulations could result in sanctions and/or remedies against cdd and have a material adverse effect upon the company. the conduct of animal research at cdd's facilities must be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which those activities are conducted. these laws and regulations include the u.s animal welfare act (awa), which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals for research in the u.s. other than laboratory rats, mice and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the u.s. department of agriculture (usda). the awa establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care and recordkeeping. similar laws and regulations apply in other jurisdictions in which cdd conducts animal research, including the european union (e.u.) and china. cdd complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by these laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it conducts animal research. if an enforcement agency determines that cdd's equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. for noncompliance, the agency may take action against cdd that may include fines, suspension and/or revocation of animal research licenses, or confiscation of research animals. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel, including key management personnel, could adversely affect the company's business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified employees at the company's clinical laboratories, drug development, and diagnostic facilities could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company's leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing and diagnostic technologies will depend in part on the company's ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company's early discovery, clinical and commercial laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced professionals, including specialists, who perform laboratory research activities and testing services. the same is true for patient-facing staff with specialized training required to perform activities related to specimen collection or clinical research activities. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. changes in key management, or the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, could lead to strategic and operational challenges and uncertainties, distractions of management from other key initiatives, and inefficiencies and increased costs, any of which could adversely affect the company's business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. unproductive labor environment, union strikes, work stoppages, works council negotiations, or failure to comply with labor or employment laws could adversely affect the company's operations and have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. the company is a party to a limited number of collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and is subject to unionization activity, employment and labor laws and unionization activity in the u.s. similar employment and labor obligations exist across other countries in which it conducts business, including appropriate engagement with works councils in europe. disputes with regard to the terms of labor agreements or obligations for consultation, potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions, unionization activity, or a failure to comply with labor or employment laws could result in, among other things, labor unrest, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns by the affected workers, fines and penalties. if any of these events were to occur, or other employees were to become unionized, the company could experience a significant disruption of its operations or higher ongoing labor costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. additionally, future labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, or changes in labor or employment laws, could compromise its service reliability and significantly increase its costs, which could have a material adverse effect upon the company's business. also, the company may incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and enforcement actions if the company fails to comply with legal requirements affecting its workforce and labor practices, including laws and regulations related to wage and hour practices, office of federal contract compliance programs (ofccp) compliance, and unlawful workplace harassment and discrimination. a significant increase in lcd's or cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including its cash flow, by increasing its bad debt or decreasing its cash flow. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers, including doctors, patients, hundreds of insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. in addition to billing complexities, lcd has experienced an increase in patient responsibility as a result of managed care fee-for-service plans that continue to increase patient deductibles, coinsurance and copayments, or implement restrictive coverage or 40 index administrative policies that can further increase patient costs. lcd expects this trend to continue. a material increase in lcd's days sales outstanding level could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially increasing its bad debt rate and decreasing its cash flows. although cdd does not face the same level of complexity in its billing processes, it could also experience delays in billing or collection, and a material increase in cdd's days sales outstanding could have an adverse effect on the company's business, including potentially decreasing its cash flows. failure in the company's information technology systems or delays or failures in the development and implementation of updates or enhancements to those systems could significantly increase testing turnaround time or delay billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company's operations or customer relationships. the company's operations and customer relationships depend, in part, on the continued performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of its recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company's systems in one or more of its operations could disrupt the company's ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results or drug development data in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company's information technology systems could adversely affect the company's business, profitability and financial condition. hardware and software failures, delays in the operation of computer and communications systems, the failure to implement new systems or system enhancements to existing systems, and cybersecurity breaches may harm the company. the company's success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications systems. a failure of the network or data-gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, customer orders and day-to-day management of the business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. while certain operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, there currently are not redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide information technology capacity in the event of a system failure. despite any precautions the company may take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and similar events at the company's various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the servers and from the servers to customers. in addition, any failure by the computer environment to provide required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in service. in the event of a delay in the delivery of data, the company could be required to transfer data collection operations to an alternative provider of server-hosting services. such a transfer could result in delays in the ability to deliver products and services to customers. additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, or improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage the company's reputation and harm the business. security breaches and unauthorized access to the company's or its customers' data could harm the company's reputation and adversely affect its business. the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience attempts by computer programmers and hackers to attack and penetrate the company's layered security controls, like the 2018 ransomware attack. the company has also experienced and expects to continue to experience similar attempts to attack and penetrate the systems of third-party suppliers and vendors to whom the company has provided data, like the 2019 data breach of retrieval-masters credit bureau, inc. d/b/a/ american medical collections agency (amca). these attempts, if successful, could result in the misappropriation or compromise of personal information or proprietary or confidential information stored within the company's systems or within the systems of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. external actors may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack the company's systems, the systems of third-parties, or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments through illegal electronic spamming, phishing, spear phishing, or other tactics. the company has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, including evaluating the cybersecurity status of third-party suppliers and vendors that will have access to the company's data or information technology systems, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. however, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the company may be unable to anticipate all of these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. in addition, as cyber threats continue to evolve, the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company's information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. the company's remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. this could also impact the cost and availability of cyber insurance to the company. breaches of the company's or third-parties' security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of personal, proprietary or confidential information about the company or its customers or other third-parties could expose customers' private information. such breaches could expose customers to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose the company or other third-parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and 41 index potential liability for the company, damage the company's brand and reputation or otherwise harm the company's business. any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on the company's business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters, political crises, public health crises, and other events outside of the company's control. natural disasters, such as adverse weather, fires, earthquakes, power shortages and outages, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability, or other conflict, criminal activities, public health crises, such as coronavirus (covid-19) and disease epidemics and pandemics, and other disruptions or events outside of the company's control could negatively affect the company's operations. any of these events may result in a temporary decline of volumes in both segments. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company's ability to transport specimens, the company's ability to efficiently commence studies, the company's information technology systems, the company's ability to utilize certain laboratories, and/or the company's ability to receive material from its suppliers. such events can also affect customer operations and thereby impact testing volume. long-term disruptions in the infrastructure and operations caused by such events (particularly involving locations in which the company has operations), could harm the company's operating results. a significant deterioration in the economy could negatively impact testing volumes, drug development services, cash collections and the availability of credit. the company's operations are dependent upon ongoing demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services by patients, physicians, hospitals, mcos, biopharmaceutical companies and others. a significant downturn in the economy could negatively impact the demand for diagnostic testing and drug development services, as well as the ability of customers to pay for services rendered. in addition, uncertainty in the credit markets could reduce the availability of credit and impact the company's ability to meet its financing needs in the future. foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the company's business. the company has business and operations outside the u.s., and cdd derives a significant portion of its revenues from international operations. since the company's consolidated financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on reported results. in addition, cdd may incur costs in one currency related to its services or products for which it is paid in a different currency. as a result, factors associated with international operations, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, could significantly affect cdd's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the company's international operations could subject it to additional risks and expenses that could adversely impact the business or results of operations. the company's international operations expose it to risks from failure to comply with foreign laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the u.s. in addition, the company may be adversely affected by other risks of expanded operations in foreign countries, including, but not limited to, changes in reimbursement by foreign governments for services provided by the company; compliance with export controls and trade regulations; changes in tax policies or other foreign laws; compliance with foreign labor and employee relations laws and regulations; restrictions on currency repatriation; judicial systems that less strictly enforce contractual rights; countries that do not have clear or well-established laws and regulations concerning issues relating to commercial laboratory testing or drug development services; countries that provide less protection for intellectual property rights; and procedures and actions affecting approval, production, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of products and services. further, international operations could subject the company to additional expenses that the company may not fully anticipate, including those related to enhanced time and resources necessary to comply with foreign laws and regulations, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods, and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations. in some countries, the company's success will depend in part on its ability to form relationships with local partners. the company's inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements could adversely affect the business and operations. expanded international operations may increase the company's exposure to liabilities under the anti-corruption laws. anti-corruption laws in the countries where the company conducts business, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa), u.k. bribery act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions, prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery including improperly offering, promising, paying or authorizing the giving of anything of value to individuals or entities for the purpose of corruptly obtaining or retaining business. the company operates in some parts of the world where corruption may be common and where anti-corruption laws may conflict to some degree with local customs and practices. the company maintains an anti-corruption program including policies, procedures and training and safeguards in the engagement and management of third parties acting on the company's behalf. despite these safeguards, the company cannot guarantee protection from corrupt acts committed by employees or third parties associated with the company. violations or allegations of violations of anti-corruption 42 index laws could have a significant adverse effect on the business or results of operations. changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such may have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the company. u.s. and foreign governments continue to review, reform and modify tax laws, including with respect to the organisation for economic co-operation and development's base erosion and profit shifting initiative. changes in tax laws and regulations could result in material changes to the domestic and foreign taxes that the company is required to provide for and pay. in addition, the company is subject to regular audits with respect to its various tax returns and processes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. errors or omissions in tax returns, process failures or differences in interpretation of tax laws by tax authorities and the company may lead to litigation, payments of additional taxes, penalties and interest. a failure to identify and successfully close and integrate strategic acquisition targets could have a material adverse effect on the company's business objectives and its revenues and profitability. part of the company's strategy involves deploying capital in investments that enhance the company's business, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions to strengthen the company's scientific capabilities and enhance therapeutic expertise, enhance esoteric testing and global drug development capabilities, and increase presence in key geographic areas. since 2015, the company has invested net cash of approximately $7.2 billion and equity of $1.8 billion in strategic business acquisitions. however, the company cannot assure that it will be able to identify acquisition targets that are attractive to the company or that are of a large enough size to have a meaningful impact on the company's operating results. furthermore, the successful closing and integration of a strategic acquisition entails numerous risks, including, among others: failure to obtain regulatory clearance, including due to antitrust concerns; loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; unidentified regulatory problems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; unanticipated costs and other liabilities; potential liabilities related to litigation including the acquired companies; potential periodic impairment of goodwill and intangible assets acquired; coordination of geographically separated facilities and workforces; and the potential disruption of the ongoing business and diversion of management's resources. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company's business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions, including with respect to revenues and profitability. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects from such acquisitions. the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect the company's liquidity, results of operations and business. at december 31, 2019, indebtedness on the company's outstanding senior notes totaled approximately $5,860.0 million in aggregate principal. the company is also a party to credit agreements relating to a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and a 2019 term loan with a balance of $375.0 million as of december 31, 2019. under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility, the company is subject to negative covenants limiting subsidiary indebtedness and certain other covenants typical for investment-grade-rated borrowers, and the company is required to maintain a leverage ratio within certain limits. the company's level of indebtedness could adversely affect its business. in particular, it could increase the company's vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit its ability to obtain further financing, and limit its ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities, including large acquisitions. the company may also enter into additional transactions or credit facilities, including other long-term debt, which may increase its indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon the business. in addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate the company's debt based on a number of factors. there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect the company's cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets. global economic conditions and government and regulatory changes, including, but not limited to, the u.k.'s exit from the european union (e.u.) could adversely impact the company's business and results of operations. the company could be adversely impacted due to the consequences of changes in the economy, governments or regulations across the globe. on january 31, 2020 the u.k. withdrew from its membership of the e.u. (often referred to as brexit). during an implementation period which is due to end on december 31, 2020, e.u. laws and regulations will continue to apply to the u.k. the terms of future relations between the u.k. and e.u. following this implementation period have not yet been determined. until 43 index this process is completed, it is difficult to anticipate how the clinical trial landscape in the u.k. might change in the next several years. this type of development or other government or regulatory change could depress economic activity, which could adversely impact the company's business, financial condition and results of operations. this could include long-term volatility in the currency markets and long-term detrimental effects on the value of affected currencies. the company's uses of financial instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations could expose it to risks and financial losses that may adversely affect the company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. to reduce the company's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and currency exchange fluctuations, it has entered into, and in the future may enter into for these or other purposes, financial swaps, or hedging arrangements, with various financial counterparties. in addition to any risks related to the counterparties, there can be no assurances that the company's hedging activity will be effective in insulating it from the risks associated with the underlying transactions, that the company would not have been better off without entering into these hedges, or that the company will not have to pay additional amounts upon settlement. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 64 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk (in millions) market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. in the ordinary course of business, the company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and the company regularly evaluates the exposure to such changes. the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that includes, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company's zero-coupon subordinated notes contained features were considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. foreign currency exchange rates approximately 12.7% and 13.6% of the company's revenues for the year ended december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, were denominated in currencies other than the u.s. dollar (usd). the company's financial statements are reported in usd and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into usd for purposes of reporting the company's consolidated financial results. in both 2019 and 2018 , the most significant 64 index currency exchange rate exposures were to the canadian dollar, swiss franc, euro and british pound. excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10% in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to usd would have impacted income before income taxes for 2019 by approximately $4.3. gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of shareholders' equity were $104.4 and $(176.6) at december 31, 2019 , and 2018 , respectively. the company does not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. the company earns revenue from service contracts over a period of several months and, in some cases, over a period of several years. accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect the company's profitability with respect to such contracts. the company is also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. the company limits its foreign currency transaction risk through exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in some of its contracts with customers, or it may hedge transaction risk with foreign currency forward contracts. at december 31, 2019 , the company had 34 open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2020 with a notional value totaling approximately $369.2. at december 31, 2018 , the company had 34 open foreign exchange forward contracts with various amounts maturing monthly through january 2019 with a notional value totaling approximately $487.9. the company is party to usd to swiss franc cross-currency swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0, maturing in 2022 and 2025, as a hedge against the impact of foreign exchange movements on its net investment in a swiss franc functional currency subsidiary. interest rates some of the company's debt is subject to interest at variable rates. as a result, fluctuations in interest rates affect the company's financial results. the company attempts to manage interest rate risk and overall borrowing costs through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt including the utilization of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps. borrowings under the company's term loan credit facilities and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swaps or other agreements. as of december 31, 2019 , and 2018 , the company had approximately $ 375.0 and $ 0.0 , respectively, of unhedged variable rate debt under the 2019 term loan credit facility and $0.0 and $527.1 , respectively, under the 2017 term loan credit facility. each quarter-point increase or decrease in the variable rate would result in the company's interest expense changing by approximately $0.9 per year for the company's unhedged variable rate debt. during the third quarter of 2013, the company entered into two fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements for its 4.625% senior notes due 2020 with an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 and variable interest rates based on one-month london interbank offered rate ( libor) plus 2.298% to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of the company's long-term debt. the company exited one of these swap arrangements in december 2019 in connection with the redemption of $187.9 of the 4.625% senior notes due 2020 and recorded a gain of $1.6. on december 19, 2019, the company redeemed any remaining outstanding zero-coupon subordinated notes due 2021 (the zero-coupon notes) that did not convert.risk factors 22 risk factors risks associated with the company business changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies (or in the interpretation of current regulations or policies), insurance regulation or approvals or changes in other laws, regulations or policies may adversely affect governmental and third-party coverage and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing and may have a material effect upon the company business. government payers, such as medicare and medicaid, as well as insurers, including managed care organizations, have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. from time to time, congress has considered and implemented changes in the medicare fee schedules in conjunction with budgetary legislation. further reductions of reimbursement for medicare services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests may be implemented from time to time. reimbursement for the pathology services component of our business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. reductions in the reimbursement rates of other third-party payers may occur as well. such changes in the past have resulted in reduced prices as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding often more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. further changes in federal, state, local and third-party payer regulations or policies may have a material adverse impact on our business. actions by agencies regulating insurance or changes in other laws, regulations, or policies may also have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties and/or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs if we violate health care anti-fraud and abuse laws. the company is subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local levels. the company failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations, including those relating to billing practices and relationships with physicians and hospitals, could lead to civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possible prohibitions or restrictions on the use of our laboratories. while the company believes that it conducts its operations and relationships with care in an effort to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements, there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position. such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could damage the company reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties. the company business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 or those of medicare, medicaid or other federal, state or local agencies. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 ( clia ) extend federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory clia certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. in addition, the company is subject to regulation under state law. state laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. the company cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect its business. potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the company business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. (22) failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal occupational safety and health administration act and the needlestick safety and prevention act, may result in fines and penalties and loss of licensure, and have a material adverse effect upon othe company business. the company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials as well as regulations relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. all of the company laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens, and we utilize outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. in addition, the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis b virus. these requirements, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens. in addition, the needlestick safety and prevention act requires, among other things, that the company includes in its safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needlestick injuries in the workplace. failure to comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations could subject the company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions which would have a material adverse effect on its business. in addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly. regulations requiring the use of standard transactions for health care services issued under hipaa may negatively impact the company profitability and cash flows. pursuant to hipaa, the secretary of the department of health and human services, or hhs, has issued final regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. hhs issued guidance on july 24, 2003 stating that it will not penalize a covered entity for post-implementation date transactions that are not fully compliant with the transactions standards, if the covered entity can demonstrate its good faith efforts to comply with the standards. hhs stated purpose for this flexible enforcement position was to permit health plans to mitigate unintended adverse effects on covered entities cash flow and business operations during the transition to the standards, as well as on the availability and quality of patient care. however, beginning october 1, 2005, the center for medicare and medicaid services no longer processes incoming non-hipaa-compliant electronic medicare claims. the hipaa transaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretation by payers. for instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information, including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. as a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the company inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians, the company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues. in addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments or use of a national provider identifier, could prove technically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. the company is working closely with its payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissions and with its trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. (23) compliance with the hipaa security regulations and privacy regulations may increase the company costs. the hipaa privacy and security regulations, which became fully effective in april 2003 and april 2005 respectively, establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of protected health information.. the regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including: the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for the company services, and its healthcare operations activities; a patient's rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information; the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; and administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information. the company has implemented policies and procedures related to compliance with the hipaa privacy and security regulations, as required by law. the privacy regulations establish a floor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy regulations and varying state privacy laws. in addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, the company must comply with the laws of those other countries. the federal privacy regulations restrict the company ability to use or disclose patient identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as defined by hipaa), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. the privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. although the hipaa statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, the company also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. increased competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. the clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive both in terms of price and service. pricing of laboratory testing services is one of the significant factors often used by health care providers and third-party payers in selecting a laboratory. as a result of the clinical laboratory industry undergoing significant consolidation, larger clinical laboratory providers are able to increase cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing. this consolidation results in greater price competition. the company may be unable to increase cost efficiencies sufficiently, if at all, and as a result, its net earnings and cash flows could be negatively impacted by such price competition. additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. failure to develop, or acquire, licenses for new or improved testing technologies, or the company customers using new technologies to perform their own tests, may limit the company ability to successfully achieve its business strategy. the clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to changing technology and new product introductions. the company success in maintaining a leadership position in genomic and other (24) advanced testing technologies will depend, in part, on its ability to license new and improved technologies for early diagnosis on favorable terms and to obtain appropriate coverage and reimbursement for these technologies. the company may not be able to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements and it cannot be certain that such arrangements will yield commercially successful diagnostic tests. if the company is unable to license these testing methods at competitive rates, its research and development costs may increase as a result. in addition, if the company is unable to license new or improved technologies to expand its esoteric testing businesses, its testing methods may become outdated when compared with the company competition and testing volume and revenue may be materially and adversely affected. in addition, advances in technology may lead to the development of more cost-effective point-of-care testing equipment that can be operated by physicians or other healthcare providers in their offices or by patients themselves without requiring the services of freestanding clinical laboratories. development of such technology and its use by the company customers could reduce the demand for its laboratory testing services and negatively impact our revenues. currently, most clinical laboratory testing is categorized as high or moderate complexity, and thereby is subject to extensive and costly regulation under clia. the cost of compliance with clia reduces the cost effectiveness for most physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices, and other laws limit the ability of physicians to have ownership in a laboratory and to refer tests to such a laboratory. however, manufacturers of laboratory equipment and test kits could seek to increase their sales by marketing point-of-care laboratory equipment to physicians and by selling test kits approved for home or physician office use to both physicians and patients. diagnostic tests approved for home use are automatically deemed to be waived tests under clia, which may then be performed in physician office laboratories as well as by patients in their homes with minimal regulatory oversight. other tests meeting certain fda criteria also may be classified as waived for clia purposes. the fda has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories and has taken responsibility from the centers for disease control for classifying the complexity of tests for clia purposes. increased approval of waived test kits could lead to increased testing by physicians in their offices, which could affect the company market for laboratory testing services and negatively impact its revenues. changes in payer mix, including an increase in capitated managed-cost health care or new national or networking managed care purchasing models, could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. most testing services are billed to a party other than the physician or other authorized person that ordered the test. in addition, tests ordered by a single physician may be billed to different payers depending on the medical benefits of a particular patient. increases in the percentage of services billed to government and managed care payers could have an adverse impact on the company net revenues. for the year ended december 31, 2006, the percentage of accessions by payer was: private patients - 2.3%, medicare, medicaid and other 20.0%, commercial clients - 34.4% and managed care 43.3%. managed care providers typically contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and then designate the laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating physicians. the majority of the company managed care testing is negotiated on a fee-for-service basis at a discount from our patient prices. such discounts have historically resulted in price erosion and have negatively impacted the company operating margins. in addition, managed care organizations have used capitated payment contracts in an attempt to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. under a capitated payment contract, the clinical laboratory and managed care organization agree to a per member, per month payment to cover all laboratory tests during the month, regardless of the number or cost of the (25) tests actually performed. such contracts shift the risk of additional testing beyond that covered by the capitated payment to the clinical laboratory. for the year ended december 31, 2006, capitated contracts accounted for approximately $144.0 million, or 4.0%, of the company net sales. recently, certain managed care companies have adopted or expressed interest in adopting new national or networking managed care laboratory services purchasing models. if the company is unable to participate in these new models, or if the company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. in addition, medicare and medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services, including clinical laboratory services. measures to regulate health care delivery in general, and clinical laboratories in particular, have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by increasing complexity and adding new regulatory and administrative requirements. pursuant to legislation passed in late 2003, the percentage of medicare beneficiaries enrolled in medicare managed care plans is expected to increase. the company expects efforts to impose reduced reimbursements and more stringent cost controls by government and other payers to continue. if the company cannot offset additional reductions in the payments it receives for its services by reducing costs, increasing test volume and/or introducing new procedures, it could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. a failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners, a loss of existing customers or material contracts, or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, could impact the company ability to successfully grow its business. to offset efforts by payers to reduce the cost and utilization of clinical laboratory services, the company needs to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners. in addition, a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers, without offsetting growth in our customer base, could impact the company ability to successfully grow its business and could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. we compete primarily on the basis of the quality of testing, reporting and information systems, reputation in the medical community, the pricing of services and ability to employ qualified personnel. the company failure to successfully compete on any of these factors could result in the loss of customers and a reduction in the company ability to expand its customer base. in addition, the company relies on developing alliances with hospitals to expand its business through traditional and non-traditional business models. reference agreements, or the traditional business model, provide a means for hospitals to outsource patient laboratory testing services that are esoteric or complex, or that are not time critical. a non-traditional business model is where the company provides technical support services in a variety of health care settings. the company ability to expand the number of alliances with hospitals and maintain current alliances, many of which are terminable on short notice, could impact its ability to successfully grow its business. (26) a failure to integrate newly acquired businesses and the costs related to such integration could have a material adverse impact on the company net revenues and profitability. the successful integration of any business which the company may acquire in the future entails numerous risks, including, among others: loss of key customers or employees; difficulty in consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure and in standardizing information and other systems; failure to maintain the quality of services that such companies have historically provided; and coordination of geographically-separated facilities and workforces; and diversion of management attention from the day-to-day business of our company. the company cannot assure that current or future acquisitions, if any, or any related integration efforts will be successful, or that the company business will not be adversely affected by any future acquisitions. even if the company is able to successfully integrate the operations of companies or businesses that it may acquire in the future, the company may not be able to realize the benefits that it expects to result from such integration, including projected cost savings within the projected time frame or at all. adverse results in material litigation matters could have a material adverse effect upon the company business. the company may become subject in the ordinary course of business to material legal action related to, among other things, intellectual property disputes, professional liability and employee-related matters, as well as inquiries from governmental agencies and medicare or medicaid carriers requesting comment on allegations of billing irregularities that are brought to their attention through billing audits or third parties. legal actions could result in substantial monetary damages as well as damage to the company reputation with customers, which could have a material adverse effect upon its business. an inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company business. the loss of key management personnel or the inability to attract and retain experienced and qualified skilled employees at the company clinical laboratories and research centers could adversely affect the business. the success of the company is dependent in part on the efforts of key members of its management team. success in maintaining the company leadership position in genomic and other advanced testing technologies will depend in part on the company ability to attract and retain skilled research professionals. in addition, the success of the company clinical laboratories also depends on employing and retaining qualified and experienced laboratory professionals, including specialists, who perform clinical laboratory testing services. in the future, if competition for the services of these professionals increases, the company may not be able to continue to attract and retain individuals in its markets. the company revenues and earnings could be adversely affected if a significant number of professionals terminate their relationship with the company or become unable or unwilling to continue their employment. a significant increase in the company days sales outstanding levels could have an adverse effect on the company business. billing for laboratory services is a complex process. laboratories bill many different payers such as doctors, patients, hundreds of different insurance companies, medicare, medicaid and employer groups, all of which have different billing requirements. a material change in the company days sales outstanding level ( dso ) resulting in an increase in the company bad debt expense and dso could have an adverse effect on the company business. (27) failure in the company information technology systems could significantly increase testing turn-around time or billing processes and otherwise disrupt the company operations. the company laboratory operations depend, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of its information technology systems. despite network security measures and other precautions the company has taken, its information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. in addition, the company is in the process of integrating the information technology systems of our recently acquired subsidiaries, and the company may experience system failures or interruptions as a result of this process. sustained system failures or interruption of the company systems in one or more of its laboratory operations could disrupt the company ability to process laboratory requisitions, perform testing, provide test results in a timely manner and/or bill the appropriate party. failure of the company information technology systems could adversely affect the company business, profitability and financial condition. operations may be disrupted and adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism, or other criminal activities, or disease pandemics. the company operations may be adversely impacted by the effects of natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, or acts of terrorism or other criminal activities or disease pandemics. such events may result in a temporary decline in the number of patients who seek laboratory testing services. in addition, such events may temporarily interrupt the company ability to transport specimens, the company ability to utilize certain laboratories or to receive material from its suppliers. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company addresses its exposure to market risks, principally the market risk associated with changes in interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that has included in the past, the use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements. although, as set forth below, the company zero coupon-subordinated notes contain features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments, the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. the company does not believe that its exposure to market risk is material to the company financial position or results of operations. the company zero coupon-subordinated notes contain the following two features that are considered to be embedded derivative instruments under sfas no. 133: 1) the company will pay contingent cash interest on the zero coupon-subordinated notes after september 11, 2006, if the average market price of the notes equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and contingent additional principal, if any, for a specified measurement period. 2) holders may surrender zero coupon-subordinated notes for conversion during any period in which the rating assigned to the zero coupon-subordinated notes by standard &amp; poor ratings services is bb- or lower. based upon independent appraisals, these embedded derivatives had no fair market value at december 31, 2006. borrowings under the company revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates, unless fixed through interest rate swap or other agreements. two of the company joint venture partnerships operate in canada and remit the company share of partnership income in canadian dollars. accordingly, the cash flow received from these affiliates is subject to a certain amount of foreign currency exchange risk.
