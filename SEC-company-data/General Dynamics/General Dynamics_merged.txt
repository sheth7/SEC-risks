risk factors 18 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business. because three of our four business groups serve the defense market, our revenues are concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves some specific risks. in addition, our sales to international customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. despite the varying nature of our u.s. and international defense and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each group shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems. the u.s. government provides a significant portion of our revenues. in each of the past three years, approximately two-thirds of our revenues were from the u.s. government. u.s. defense spending is driven by threats to national security. while the country has been under an elevated threat level for more than a decade, competing demands for federal funds could pressure all areas of spending. a decrease in u.s. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could have some impact on our financial performance. several factors are currently affecting u.s. defense spending, including: the fact that the congress has not passed a fiscal year (fy) 2013 budget, resulting in the u.s. government, including the dod, operating under a continuing resolution (cr) that provides funding at fy 2012 levels through march 2013; a $487 billion, or approximately 8 percent, reduction to previously-planned defense funding over the next decade as mandated by the budget control act of 2011 (bca). these cuts were incorporated into the fy 2013 proposed defense budget; and a sequester mechanism, also part of the bca, that would impose an additional $500 billion of defense cuts over nine years starting in fy 2013, which represents approximately 9 percent of planned defense funding over the period. while we are unable to predict the exact impact on our programs or financial outlook, these factors, particularly the funding reductions of the magnitude imposed by the sequester mechanism as written, could in the aggregate have material adverse operational and financial consequences, depending on how the cuts are allocated across the budget. due to its shorter-cycle businesses, the information systems and technology outlook is more sensitive than our other defense groups to any additional budget cuts that may occur. for additional information relating to the u.s. defense budget, see the business environment section of 18 management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii, item 7, of this annual report on form 10-k. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and are subject to termination. our u.s. government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. early each calendar year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. for the remainder of the year, the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president's budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. there are two primary risks associated with the u.s. government budget cycle. first, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted. for example, changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities, or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process. if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the u.s. government can shut down or operate under a cr that maintains spending at prior year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. second, the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. future revenues under existing multi-year contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. in addition, u.s. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings. government contractors are subject to audit by the u.s. government. u.s. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. these agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. the u.s. government also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor's compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, labor, accounting and information systems. in some cases, audits may result in contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. in addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. our aerospace group's business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by business, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the group's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets. in addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the group's anticipated revenues and profitability could be materially reduced as a result. 19 earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. these projections assess: the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and components, and schedule requirements. if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of our contracts may be adversely affected. this could affect our earnings and margins materially. our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance. we rely on other companies to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer problems. however, we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. international sales and operations are subject to different, and sometimes greater, risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government's budgets, leadership and national priorities, including the current european fiscal condition. international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect revenues and earnings associated with our international business. in addition, some international government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar arrangements or to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy certain requirements. if we do not satisfy these requirements, our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected. our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes. our customers' requirements change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. because of the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected. 20 we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies, market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results, including future impairment charges. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. as a defense contractor, we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, as well as threats to physical security. we also design and manage information technology systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own. accordingly, we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems. if any of these threats were to materialize, the event could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for u.s. government customers, as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially. 21 forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, outlook, estimates, should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these include but are not limited to projections of revenues, earnings, operating margins, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this section. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to general dynamics or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8, of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of these risks. the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. foreign currency risk. we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of $4 billion on december 31, 2011 , and $2.5 billion on december 31, 2012 . a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax losses: 2011 2012 recognized $ (57 ) $ (61 ) unrecognized (176 ) (71 ) this exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the u.s. dollar/canadian dollar, euro/canadian dollar and swiss franc/euro exchange rates. we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. on december 31, 2012 , we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years . on december 31, 2012 , we held $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents, but held no marketable securities. 51risk factors 16 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business. our revenues are concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves some specific risks. in addition, our

national security. while the country has been under an elevated threat level for more than a decade, competing demands for federal funds are pressuring various areas of spending. defense investment accounts (budgets for procurement and research and development) remain under pressure. decreases in u.s. government defense spending, including investment accounts, or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance. for additional information relating to the u.s. defense budget, see the business environment section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and

with the u.s. government budget cycle. first, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted, which has occurred during the past few years. for example, changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities, or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process. if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the u.s. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards.

generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a

market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by business, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the aerospace group's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets. in addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the group's anticipated revenues and profitability could be materially reduced as a result. earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform on our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. these projections and estimates assess: the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and components, and schedule requirements. if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. this could affect earnings and margins materially. earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance.

operations are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government's budgets, leadership and national priorities. international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. our international business is subject to u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anti-corruption laws, and the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with u.s. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenues and earnings associated with our international business. in addition, some international government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. we may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy certain requirements or face penalties. offset requirements may extend over several years and require us to establish joint ventures with local companies. if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected. our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes. our customers' requirements change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. because of the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies, market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results. changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and 18 intangible assets acquired. goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in defense spending. we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the recoverability of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. as a defense contractor, we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial of service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. we also design and manage information technology systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own. accordingly, we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems. we have experienced cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for u.s. government customers, as well as negatively impact our results of operations materially. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. 19 forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, outlook, estimates, should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these include but are not limited to projections of revenues, earnings, operating margins, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this section. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to general dynamics or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks. the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. foreign currency risk. we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of $2.5 billion on december 31, 2012 , and $1.7 billion on december 31, 2013 . a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax losses: 2012 2013 recognized $ (61 ) $ (51 ) unrecognized (71 ) (40 ) this exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the u.s. dollar/canadian dollar, euro/swiss franc and euro/canadian dollar exchange rates. we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. on december 31, 2013 , we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years . on december 31, 2013 , we held $5.3 billion in cash and equivalents, but no marketable securities. 49risk factors 15 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business. our revenues are concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves some specific risks. in addition, our sales to non-u.s. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. despite the varying nature of our u.s. and non-u.s. defense and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each group shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems. the u.s. government provides a significant portion of our revenues. approximately 60 percent of our revenues are from the u.s. government. u.s. defense spending is driven by threats to national security. while the country has been under an elevated threat level for more than a decade, competing demands for federal funds are pressuring various areas of spending. defense investment accounts (budgets for procurement and research and development) remain under pressure. decreases in u.s. government defense spending, including investment accounts, or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance. for additional information relating to the u.s. defense budget, see the business environment section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay. our u.s. government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. early each calendar year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. for the remainder of the year, the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president's budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. 15 there are two primary risks associated with the u.s. government budget cycle. first, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted, which has occurred in recent years. for example, changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities, or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process. if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the u.s. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. second, the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. future revenues under existing multi-year contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. our u.s. government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer. u.s. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings. government contractors are subject to audit by the u.s. government. numerous u.s. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. these agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. the u.s. government also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor's compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. in some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. in addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. in some cases, audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements, arbitration or litigation. our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. the business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by business, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the aerospace group's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets. in addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the group's anticipated revenues and profitability could be reduced materially as a result. earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform on our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. these projections and estimates assess: the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and components, and 16 schedule requirements. if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. this could affect earnings and margins materially. earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance. we rely on other companies to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law. misconduct by subcontractors, such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities, may harm our future revenues and earnings. we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues. however, we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities. sales and operations outside the u.s. are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our non-u.s. business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government's budgets, leadership and national priorities. non-u.s. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. our non-u.s. business is subject to u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the foreign corrupt practices act and certain other anti-corruption laws, and the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with u.s. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenues and earnings associated with our non-u.s. business. in addition, some non-u.s. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. we may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy certain requirements or face penalties. offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to establish joint ventures with local companies. if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected. our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes. our customers' requirements change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. if we were unable to develop new products that meet 17 customers' changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies, market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results. changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment. goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group. we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in defense spending. we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial of service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. we also design and manage information technology systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own. in addition, we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers, vendors and subcontractors. accordingly, we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems. we have experienced cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, including viruses and attacks by hackers. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for u.s. government customers, as well as impact our results of operations materially. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. 18 forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, outlook, estimates, should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. examples include projections of revenues, earnings, operating margins, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog. in making these statements we rely on assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable based on information available to us at the time. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this section. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to general dynamics or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on sec forms 10-q and 8-k. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks. the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. foreign currency. we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of $9.1 billion on december 31, 2014 , and $1.7 billion on december 31, 2013 . the increase in 2014 is due to significant international contract awards. a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical, incremental pretax losses: 2014 2013 recognized $ (25 ) $ (51 ) unrecognized (823 ) (40 ) this exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the u.s. dollar/canadian dollar, euro/canadian dollar and euro/british pound exchange rates. while the hypothetical pretax losses in the table above have increased significantly from 2013, we do not believe this represents a meaningful increase in our risk profile as these losses would continue to be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. on december 31, 2014 , we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years . on december 31, 2014 , we held $4.4 billion in cash and equivalents and $500 of marketable securities reported in other current assets. 49risk factors 16 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business. our revenue is concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves some specific risks. in addition, our sales to non-u.s. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. despite the varying nature of our u.s. and non-u.s. defense and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each group shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems. the u.s. government provides a significant portion of our revenue. approximately 55 percent of our revenue is from the u.s. government. levels of u.s. defense spending are driven by threats to national security. competing demands for federal funds pressure various areas of spending, and defense investment accounts (budgets for procurement and research and development) remain under pressure. decreases in u.s. government defense spending, including investment accounts, or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance. for additional information relating to the u.s. defense budget, see the business environment section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay. our u.s. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. early each calendar year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. for the remainder of the year, the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president's budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. there are two primary risks associated with the u.s. government budget cycle. first, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted, which has occurred in recent years. for example, changes in congressional 16 schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities, or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process. if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the u.s. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. second, the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. future revenue under existing multi-year contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. our u.s. government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer. u.s. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. government contractors are subject to audit by the u.s. government. numerous u.s. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. these agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. the u.s. government also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. in some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. in addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. in some cases, audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements, arbitration or litigation. our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. the business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by business, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the aerospace group's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit, pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets. in addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the group's anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially as a result. earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. these projections and estimates assess: the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and components, and schedule requirements. 17 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. this could affect earnings and margin materially. earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance. we rely on other companies to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law. misconduct by subcontractors, such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities, may harm our future revenue and earnings. we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues. we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activities. sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our non-u.s. business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government's budgets, leadership and national priorities, which may occur suddenly. non-u.s. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. our non-u.s. business is subject to u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws, and the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with u.s. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-u.s. business. in addition, some non-u.s. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. we may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties. offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements. if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system-integration processes. our customers' requirements change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. some new products, particularly in our aerospace group, must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control. additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs 18 and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies, market conditions following the acquisition and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results. changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group. we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in defense spending. we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. we also design and manage information technology systems and products that contain information technology systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own. in addition, we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers, vendors and subcontractors. accordingly, we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems and conduct employee training on cyber security. we have experienced cyber security threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, including viruses and attacks by hackers. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could cause harm to our business and our reputation and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers, as well as impact our results of operations materially. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. 19 forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on

changing customer demand for business aircraft. the business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by business, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the aerospace group's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit, pricing pressures and trends in

business in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our non-u.s. business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government's budgets, leadership and national priorities, which may occur suddenly. non-u.s. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. our non-u.s. business is subject to u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws, and the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with u.s. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-u.s. business. in addition, some non-u.s. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. we may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties. offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements. if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system-integration

retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved; the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies; market conditions following the acquisition; and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results. changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. goodwill is subject 19 to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group. we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in defense spending. we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. we also design and manage information technology systems and products that contain information technology systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems. in addition, we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers, vendors, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business. accordingly, we maintain information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, and conduct employee training on cyber security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats. we have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks by hackers targeting our information technology systems. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could, among other things, cause harm to our business and our reputation; disrupt our operations; expose us to potential liability, regulatory actions and the loss of business; and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers, as well as impact our results of operations materially. due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. 20 forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, outlook, estimates, should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. examples include projections of revenue, earnings, operating margin, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog. in making these statements we rely on assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable based on information available to us at the time. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this form 10-k. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to general dynamics or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on sec forms 10-q and 8-k. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note m to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks. the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of $6.3 billion on december 31, 2016 , and $7.2 billion on december 31, 2015 . a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical, incremental pretax losses: (dollars in millions) 2016 2015 recognized $ (27 ) $ (8 ) unrecognized (536 ) (652 ) foreign currency. our exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar, euro and british pound exchange rates. these losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate, long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. on december 31, 2016 , we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. investment risk. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years . on december 31, 2016 , we held $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents, but held no marketable securities. 52risk factors 17 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business. our revenue is concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves some specific risks. in addition, our sales to non-u.s. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. despite the varying nature of our u.s. and non-u.s. defense and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each group shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems. the u.s. government provides a significant portion of our revenue. in 2017, approximately 60% of our consolidated revenue was from the u.s. government. levels of u.s. defense spending are driven by threats to national security. competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending. decreases in u.s. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance. for additional information relating to the u.s. defense budget, see the business environment section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay. our u.s. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. early each calendar year, the president of the united states presents to congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. for the remainder of the year, the appropriations and authorization committees of congress review the president's budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. there are two primary risks associated with the u.s. government budget cycle. first, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted, which has occurred in recent years. if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the u.s. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for 17 our programs and timing of new awards. second, congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. future revenue under existing multi-year contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. our u.s. government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer. u.s. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the u.s. government. numerous u.s. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. these agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. the u.s. government also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. in some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. in addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. in some cases, audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements, arbitration or litigation. moreover, new laws, regulations or standards, or changes to existing ones, can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability. our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. the business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by corporate, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the aerospace group's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit, pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets. in addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the group's anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially. earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. these projections and estimates assess: the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and components, and schedule requirements. if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. this could affect earnings and margin materially. 18 earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance. we rely on other companies to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law. misconduct by subcontractors, such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities, may harm our future revenue and earnings. we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issues. we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon materials, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities. sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our non-u.s. business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government's budgets, leadership and national priorities, which may occur suddenly. non-u.s. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. our non-u.s. business is subject to u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws, and the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with u.s. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-u.s. business. in addition, some non-u.s. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. we may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties. offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements. if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system-integration processes. our customers' requirements change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. some new products, particularly in our aerospace group, must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control. additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures, 19 we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved; the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies; market conditions following the acquisition; and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results. changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our business groups or a decision to dispose of a business group or a significant portion of a business group. we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in defense spending. we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology (it) infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems. in addition, we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers, vendors, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business. accordingly, we maintain information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, and conduct employee training on cyber security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats. we have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could, among other things, cause harm to our business and our reputation; disrupt our operations; expose us to potential liability, regulatory actions and loss of business; challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers; and impact our results of operations materially. due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. forward-looking

sec forms 10-q and 8-k. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks. the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we had notional forward exchange contracts outstanding of $4.3 billion on december 31, 2017 , and $6.3 billion on december 31, 2016 . in 2017, we changed our method for calculating the hypothetical, incremental pretax gains (losses) to measure the net gains (losses) for each currency pair across our portfolio of forward exchange contracts (e.g., canadian dollar/u.s. dollar), rather than measure the gains (losses) on a contract-by-contract basis. the underlying portfolio and the associated exchange-rate risk have not changed. we restated the 2016 amount under the new method to provide comparability between 2017 and 2016. a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical, incremental pretax gains (losses): (dollars in millions) 2017 2016 recognized $ (29 ) $ (19 ) unrecognized 33 18 foreign currency. our exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar, euro and british pound exchange rates. these losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these foreign currency forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate, long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. on december 31, 2017 , we had $4 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10% unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. investment risk. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years . on december 31, 2017 , we held $3 billion in cash and equivalents, but held no marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers' compensation and non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans . on december 31, 2017 , these marketable securities totaled $191 and were reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other current and noncurrent assets . 51risk factors 19 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business. our revenue is concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves some specific risks. in addition, our sales to non-u.s. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. despite the varying nature of our u.s. and non-u.s. defense and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each segment shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems. the u.s. government provides a significant portion of our revenue. in 2018, approximately 65% of our consolidated revenue was from the u.s. government. levels of u.s. defense spending are driven by threats to national security. competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending. decreases in u.s. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance. the budget control act of 2011 (bca) establishes caps for defense spending over a 10-year period through 2021, including a sequester mechanism that would impose additional defense cuts. in february 2018, the congress approved increases to the bca spending caps through fiscal year (fy) 2019. however, the bca's spending limits for fy 2020 and fy 2021 have not been increased or otherwise modified. the president's defense budget estimates for fy 2020 and beyond exceed the spending limits established by the bca. as a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain unless the bca is repealed or significantly modified. while it is impossible to predict the exact impact on our programs or financial outlook in light of the inherent uncertainty attendant to the sequestration process, the magnitude of potential funding reductions 19 imposed by the sequester mechanism as written, could in the aggregate have material adverse operational and financial consequences, depending on how the cuts are allocated across the budget. for additional information relating to the u.s. defense budget, see the business environment section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay. our u.s. government revenue is funded by agency

in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our non-u.s. operations may be sensitive to and impacted by changes in a foreign government's national policies and priorities, political leadership, and budgets, which may be influenced by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors. changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments. non-u.s. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. our non-u.s. operations are subject to u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-corruption laws, and the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with u.s. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-u.s. operations. 21 in addition, some non-u.s. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. we may also be required to agree to specific in-country

additionally, due to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information

the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies; market conditions following the acquisition; and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results. changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in defense spending. we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology (it) infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as 22 threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems. in addition, we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers, vendors, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business. accordingly, we maintain information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, and conduct employee training on cyber security to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats. however, there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches, disruptions, unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data. we have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could, among other things, cause harm to our business and our reputation; disrupt our operations; expose us to potential liability, regulatory actions and loss of business; challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers; and impact our results of operations materially. due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, outlook, estimates, should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. examples include projections of revenue, earnings, operating margin, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog. in making these statements we rely on assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable based on information available to us at the time. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this form 10-k. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to general dynamics or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. these factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on sec forms 10-q and 8-k. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 56 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks. the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. we had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts outstanding of $5.8 billion and $4.3 billion on december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. a 10% unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical, incremental pretax gains (losses): (dollars in millions) 2018 2017 recognized $ 61 $ (29 ) unrecognized (135 ) 33 foreign currency risk. our exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the canadian dollar, euro, swiss franc and british pound exchange rates. these losses and gains would be offset by corresponding gains and losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include variable-rate commercial paper and fixed- and floating-rate long-term debt obligations. on december 31, 2018 , we had $10.5 billion par value of fixed-rate debt, $1 billion of floating-rate notes and $850 of commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10% unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, we entered into derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap contracts, to eliminate our floating-rate interest rate risk . investment risk. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years . on december 31, 2018 , we held $963 in cash and equivalents, but held no marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our obligations under workers' compensation and non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans . on december 31, 2018 , these marketable securities totaled $202 and were reflected at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in other current and noncurrent assets . 56risk factors 19 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are some risks that apply more specifically to our business. our revenue is concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves some specific risks. in addition, our sales to non-u.s. customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operations and the markets they serve, each segment shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems. the u.s. government provides a significant portion of our revenue. in 2019, approximately 65% of our consolidated revenue was from the u.s. government. levels of u.s. defense spending are driven by threats to national security. competing demands for federal funds can pressure various areas of spending. decreases in u.s. government defense and other spending or changes in spending allocation or priorities could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated, which could impact our financial performance. for additional information relating to u.s. budget matters, see the business environment section of management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception, and any funding is subject to disruption or delay. our u.s. government revenue is funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. early each calendar year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. for the remainder of the year, the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president's budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. 19 there are two primary risks associated with the u.s. government budget cycle. first, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted. if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year, portions of the u.s. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior-year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. second, the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. future revenue under existing multi-year contracts is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. our u.s. government contracts are subject to termination rights by the customer. u.s. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs incurred and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. the termination of multiple or large programs could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings. government contractors operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the u.s. government. numerous u.s. government agencies routinely audit and review government contractors. these agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. the u.s. government also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, material, earned value management and accounting systems. in some cases, audits may result in delayed payments or contractor costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations against a contractor of improper or illegal activities, civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could result, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. in addition, reputational harm could result if allegations of impropriety were made. in some cases, audits may result in disputes with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlements, arbitration or litigation. moreover, new laws, regulations or standards, or changes to existing ones, can increase our performance and compliance costs and reduce our profitability. our aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. the business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by corporate, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the aerospace segment's results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit, pricing pressures and trends in capital goods markets. in addition, if customers default on existing contracts and the contracts are not replaced, the segment's anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially. earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. the accounting for our contracts and programs requires assumptions and estimates about these conditions and events. these projections and estimates assess: the productivity and availability of labor; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials and components; and schedule requirements. 20 if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances, estimates or assumptions, or if the risks under our contracts are not managed adequately, the profitability of contracts could be adversely affected. this could affect earnings and margin materially. earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance. we rely on other companies to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements and applicable law. misconduct by subcontractors, such as a failure to comply with procurement regulations or engaging in unauthorized activities, may harm our future revenue and earnings. we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid or minimize customer issues. we sometimes rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitments. our ability to perform our obligations may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon materials, perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner, or engages in misconduct or other improper activities. sales and operations outside the united states are subject to different risks that may be associated with doing business in foreign countries. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes, and procurement procedures may be less robust or mature, which may complicate the contracting process. our non-u.s. operations may be sensitive to and impacted by changes in a foreign government's national policies and priorities, political leadership and budgets, which may be influenced by changes in threat environments, geopolitical uncertainties, volatility in economic conditions and other economic and political factors. changes and developments in any of these matters or factors may occur suddenly and could impact funding for programs or delay purchasing decisions or customer payments. non-u.s. transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems. our non-u.s. operations are subject to u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to import-export controls, technology transfers, the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and other anti-corruption laws, and the international traffic in arms regulations (itar). an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors or a failure to comply with u.s. or foreign laws could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non-u.s. operations. in addition, some non-u.s. government customers require contractors to enter into letters of credit, performance or surety bonds, bank guarantees and other similar financial arrangements. we may also be required to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, that require us to satisfy investment or other requirements or face penalties. offset requirements may extend over several years and could require us to team with local companies to fulfill these requirements. if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirements, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system-integration processes. our customers' requirements change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. some new products, particularly in our aerospace segment, must meet extensive and time-consuming regulatory requirements that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delays. additionally, due 21 to the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. if we were unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs and satisfy regulatory requirements in a timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. when evaluating potential acquisitions and joint ventures, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies, and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved; the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies; market conditions following the acquisition; and acquired liabilities, including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition. these factors could materially adversely affect our financial results. changes in business conditions may cause goodwill and other intangible assets to become impaired. goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or a sale of a portion of the business. goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis or when circumstances indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than 50%. such circumstances include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit. we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to a variety of challenges, including changes in government spending. we may experience unforeseen circumstances that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets. future write-offs of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity events and other disruptions. we face various cybersecurity threats, including threats to our information technology (it) infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, denial-of-service attacks, as well as threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and threats from terrorist acts. we also design and manage it systems and products that contain it systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own internal systems. in addition, we face cyber threats from entities that may seek to target us through our customers, vendors, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business. accordingly, we maintain information security staff, policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, and conduct employee training on cybersecurity to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats. however, there can be no assurance that any such actions will be sufficient to prevent cybersecurity breaches, disruptions, unauthorized release of sensitive information or corruption of data. we have experienced cybersecurity threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our it systems. such prior events have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. however, future threats could, among other things, cause harm to our business and our reputation; disrupt our operations; expose us to potential liability, regulatory actions and loss of business; challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems for government customers; and impact our results of operations materially. due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the potential impact 22 of any future incident cannot be predicted. our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cybersecurity attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, outlook, estimates, should and variations of these words and similar

market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 for a discussion of these risks. the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. 50 we had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts outstanding of $5 billion and $5.8 billion on december 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. a 10% unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contracts would have resulted in the following hypothetical, incremental pretax gains

believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include variable-rate commercial paper and fixed- and floating-rate long-term debt obligations. on december 31, 2019 , we had $10.5 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and $1 billion of floating-rate notes. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10% unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements in item 8, we entered into derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swap contracts, to eliminate our floating-rate interest risk. investment risk. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years . on december 31, 2019 , we held $902 in cash and equivalents, but held no marketable securities other than those held in trust to meet some of our

risk on page 33 of the 2002 annual report, filed as exhibit 13 to this annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2002, is incorporated herein by reference in response to this item.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate and variable-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. as of december 31, 2003, the company had no short-term investments. fixed-rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable until maturity and are not actively traded by the company in the market. therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company fixed-rate debt. a hypothetical 100 basis-point increase in market rates of interest applicable to the company commercial paper balances and floating-rate notes would not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. at december 31, 2003, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain inter-company transactions in foreign currencies. the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign-denominated payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. at december 31, 2003, a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of $28 (pretax) and an incremental unrealized loss of $22 million (pretax). consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. when taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. general dynamics 2003 annual report 29 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 29 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. as of december 31, 2004, the company had no short-term investments. fixed-rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market. therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the company fixed-rate debt. a hypothetical 100 basis-point increase in market interest rates applicable to the company commercial paper balances would not have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. at december 31, 2004, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, long-term debt and certain inter-company transactions in foreign currencies. the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign-denominated payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. at december 31, 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of $14 (pretax) and an incremental unrealized loss of $56 (pretax). consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. when taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. general dynamics 2004 annual report 29risk factors 13 risk factors an investment in general dynamics common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding to purchase the company securities. because three of general dynamics four major business groups serve the defense market, the company sales are highly concentrated with the u.s. government. the customer relationship with the u.s. government involves certain risks that are unique. in addition to the u.s. government, the company defense businesses rapidly have expanded their sales to international customers in recent years, which has exposed the company to a different set of risks. the aerospace group market presents its own risks that are largely tied to u.s. and global economic conditions. despite the varying nature of the defense, international and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of materials and suppliers. the company depends on the u.s. government for a significant portion of its sales. in each of the past three years, approximately 67 percent of the company net sales were to the u.s. government. u.s. defense spending has historically been cyclical. defense budgets have received their strongest support when perceived threats to national security raise the level of concern over the country safety. as these threats subside, spending on the military tends to decrease. accordingly, while department of defense funding has grown rapidly over the past few years, there is no assurance that this trend will continue. rising budget deficits, the cost of the global war on terrorism and increasing costs for domestic programs continue to put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. wartime support for defense spending could wane if the country troop deployments in support of operations in iraq and afghanistan are reduced. a decrease in u.s. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the company programs being reduced, delayed or terminated. reductions in the company existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings. u.s. government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination. the company u.s. government sales are funded by customer budgets, which operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. in february of each year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. from february through september of each year, the appropriations and authorization committees of congress review the president budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year in appropriations and authorization legislation. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. there are two primary risks associated with this process. first, the process may be delayed or disrupted. changes in congressional schedules, negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract. this, in fact, occurred during the 2006 budget process, in which the defense appropriations bill was not approved until three months into the 2006 fiscal year, delaying contract orders that would have been awarded in 2005. second, funds for multi-year contracts can be changed in subsequent years in the appropriations process. in addition, the u.s. government has increasingly relied on indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (idiq) contracts and other procurement vehicles that are subject to a competitive bidding and funding process even after the award of the basic contract, adding an additional element of uncertainty to future funding levels. delays in the funding process or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or can lead to changes in program content or termination at the government convenience. the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the company future sales and earnings. the aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand or preferences for business aircraft. the aerospace group business-jet market is influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for business-aviation products by u.s. and foreign businesses, the u.s. and other governments, and high-net-worth individuals. the group future results depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond the company control. these factors include general economic conditions and price and demand pressures in the market. a severe downturn in these market factors could adversely affect the sales and profitability of the company aerospace group. the company earnings and margins depend on its ability to perform under its contracts. the company contracts require management to make various assumptions and projections about the outcome of future events over a period of several years. these projections can include future labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, and the timing of product deliveries. if there is a significant change in one or more of these assumptions, circumstances or estimates, or if the company is unable to control the costs incurred in performing under these contracts, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected. general dynamics 2005 annual report 13 table of contents the company earnings and margins depend on subcontractor performance and raw material and component availability and pricing. the company relies on subcontractors and other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for its products or to perform a portion of the services that the company provides to its customers. occasionally, the company relies on only one or two sources of supply, which, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on the company ability to meet its commitments to customers. the company depends on these subcontractors and vendors to fulfill their contractual obligations in a timely and satisfactory manner in full compliance with customer requirements. if one or more of the company subcontractors or suppliers is unable to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services, the company ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected. international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries. the company international business may pose greater risks than its business in the united states because in some countries there is increased potential for changes in economic, legal and political environments. the company international business is also sensitive to changes in a foreign government national priorities and budgets. international transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal systems and customs in other countries. in addition, some international customers require contractors to agree to offset programs that may require in-country purchases or manufacturing or financial support arrangements as a condition to awarding contracts. the contracts may include penalties in the event the company fails to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the company sales and earnings associated with its international business. the company future success will depend, in part, on its ability to develop new technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of its customers. virtually all of the products produced and sold by general dynamics are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system integration techniques and capabilities. both the commercial and government markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. the product and program needs of the company government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. accordingly, the company future performance in part depends on its ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. in addition, because of the highly specialized nature of its business, the company must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by the company customers. if the company is unable to develop new products that meet customers changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, future sales and earnings may be adversely affected. developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance. while the company maintains insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. the company generally seeks indemnification where the u.s. government is permitted to extend indemnification under applicable law. in addition, the company generally seeks limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of its homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002. the company may elect to provide products or services even in instances where it is unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, estimates and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these include but are not limited to projections of revenues, earnings, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog stability. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this section. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the company or any person acting on the company behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. the company does not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk, primarily related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. as of december 31, 2005, the company had no material short-term investments and no outstanding commercial paper. fixed-rate debt obligations issued by the company are generally not putable and are not actively traded by the company in the market. therefore, the company does not believe its exposure to interest rate risk is material for its fixed-rate debt. the company may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. at december 31, 2005, no interest rate swap agreements were in effect. the company also is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, long-term debt and certain inter-company transactions in foreign currencies. the company principally uses foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign-denominated payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. at december 31, 2005 and 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized loss of $5 and $14 (pretax), respectively, and an incremental unrealized loss of $26 and $56 (pretax), respectively. this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the u.s. dollar/canadian dollar exchange rates. consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, these realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. when taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. general dynamics 2005 annual report 33 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors an investment in general dynamics common stock or debt securities is subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding to purchase the company securities. investment risks can be market-wide, as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in general dynamics stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. as described below, a different range of risks apply more specifically to general dynamics because of the company mix of businesses and market exposure. these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones the company faces. additional risks and uncertainties currently considered immaterial could also impact the company business, results of operations or financial condition. companies succeed or falter in their ability, or lack thereof, to understand, anticipate, react to and manage all of these risks. investors should carefully evaluate the quality of a company management, as demonstrated by its ability to make decisions that build shareholder value over varied market, economic or international conditions. because three of general dynamics four business groups serve the defense market, the company sales are highly concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves certain unique risks. in addition, the company has expanded sales to international customers in recent years, exposing the company to different financial and legal risks. in the aerospace group market, there are risks tied to u.s. and global economic conditions. despite the varying nature of the company defense, international and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of materials and suppliers. the company depends on the u.s. government for a significant portion of its sales. in each of the past three years, approximately 68 percent of the company net sales were to the u.s. government. u.s. defense spending has historically been cyclical, and defense budgets rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the country safety. at other times, spending on the military can decrease. while department of defense funding has grown rapidly over the past few years, there is no assurance this trend will continue. competing demands for federal funds can put pressure on all areas of discretionary spending, which could ultimately impact the defense budget. a decrease in u.s. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of the company programs being reduced, delayed or terminated. reductions in the company existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could adversely affect its ability to sustain and grow its future sales and earnings. u.s. government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination. the company u.s. government sales are funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. in february of each year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. from february through september of each year, the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. there are two primary risks associated with this process. first, the process may be delayed or disrupted. changes in congressional schedules, negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract. second, future sales under existing multi-year contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. 14 general dynamics 2006 annual report table of contents delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds, lead to changes in program content or lead to termination at the government convenience. the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on the company future sales and earnings. the aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. the aerospace group business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products by u.s. and foreign businesses, the u.s. and other governments, and high-net-worth individuals. the group future results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions and trends in capital goods markets. a severe downturn in these market factors could adversely affect the sales and profitability of the company aerospace group. the company earnings and margins depend on its ability to perform under its contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, the company management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. these projections assess future labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, material cost and availability, the impact of delayed performance, and the timing of product deliveries. if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if the company faces unexpected contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected. this could affect the company earnings and margins. the company earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor performance, as well as raw material and component availability and pricing. general dynamics relies on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for its products. at times subcontractors perform services that the company provides to its customers. occasionally, the company relies on only one or two sources of supply, which, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on the company ability to meet its commitments to customers. it depends on these subcontractors and vendors to meet their contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. the company ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries. the company international business may pose greater risks than its business in the united states. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes. the company international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government national priorities and budgets. international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. in addition, some international customers require contractors to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, as a condition for a contract award. the contracts may include penalties if the company fails to meet the offset requirements. an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect the company sales and earnings associated with its international business. the company future success will depend, in part, on its ability to develop new technologies and maintain a qualified work-force to meet the needs of its customers. virtually all of the products produced and sold by the company are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. the commercial and government markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. the product and program needs of the company government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. accordingly, general dynamics future performance depends in part on its ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. in addition, because of the highly specialized nature of its business, the company must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by its customers. if the company is unable to develop new products that meet customers changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, future sales and earnings may be adversely affected. developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance. while the company maintains insurance for some business risks, it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. where permitted by applicable laws, the company seeks indemnification from the u.s. government. in addition, the company generally seeks limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of its homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002. the company may elect to provide products or services even

qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. the company foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers, long-term debt and certain inter-company transactions denominated in currencies other than the company (or one of its subsidiaries ) functional currency. the company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non-functional payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. these contracts are designed to minimize non-functional currency risks and/or risks associated with international subsidiaries that may enter into transactions outside of their own functional currency. at december 31, 2006 and 2005, the company had $1.1 billion and $760, respectively, in notional contracts outstanding. a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in the company portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental realized pretax loss of $4 in 2006 and $5 in 2005, and an incremental unrealized pretax loss of $40 in 2006 and $26 in 2005. this exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in u.s. dollar/canadian dollar exchange rates. the company believes the realized and unrealized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. when taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. as of december 31, 2006, the company had only fixed-rate debt outstanding. the company fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable and are not traded by the company in the market. the company would be subject to interest rate risk from outstanding commercial paper, but there were no outstanding balances at year-end 2006 or 2005. the company investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years. as of december 31, 2006, the company held $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents to be used for general corporate purposes. given the average weighted maturity of 11 days, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings. historically, the company has not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates. the company is also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices, primarily on long-term fixed-price contracts. to the extent possible, the company includes terms in its contracts that are designed to protect it from this risk. the company has not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant. some of the protective terms included in the company contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract. the company does not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on its results of operations or cash flows. general dynamics 2006 annual report 35 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors an

incremental recognized pretax loss of $29 in 2007 and $4 in 2006, and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of $53 in 2007 and $40 in 2006. this exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to

market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by u.s. and foreign businesses, the u.s. and other governments, and individual customers. the group future results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets. toward the end of 2008, well-known shocks to the financial and credit markets resulted in a slowdown in aircraft order flow and led to several defaults by our customers under contracts to purchase new aircraft. continued malaise in the general economy and in particular the financial services sector could result in additional defaults. if our aerospace group is unable to replace contracts terminated due to future customer defaults with existing contracts in the backlog or new contracts, the group anticipated sales and profitability could be reduced as a result. our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts. when agreeing to

subsystems for our products. subcontractors perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. occasionally, we rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries. our international business may pose different risks than our business in the united states. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes. government customers in newly formed free-market economies typically have procurement procedures that are less mature, which can complicate the contracting process. in this context, our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government leadership, national priorities and budgets. international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. in addition, some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, as a condition for a contract award. the contracts may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements. an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our sales and earnings associated with our international business. general dynamics 2008 annual report 15 table of contents our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. virtually all of the products that we produce and sell are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. the commercial and government markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. the product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends in part on our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. in addition, because of the highly specialized nature of our business, we must be able to hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future sales and earnings may be adversely affected. developing new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance. while we maintain insurance for some business risks, it is not practicable to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. where permitted by applicable laws, we seek indemnification from the u.s. government. in addition, we generally seek limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of 2002. we may elect to provide products or services even in instances where we are unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification. forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, estimates and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these include but are not limited to projections of revenues, earnings, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog stability. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this section. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to general dynamics or any person acting on our behalf are qualified by the cautionary statements in this section. we do not undertake any obligation to update or publicly release any revisions to forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances or changes in expectations after the date of this report. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. foreign currency risk our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers, payments to suppliers and certain inter-company transactions denominated in currencies other than our (or one of our subsidiaries ) functional currency. we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix, or limit the adverse impact on, the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non-functional payments, receipts and inter-company transactions related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities. these contracts are designed to minimize our risk when we enter into transactions outside our functional currency. we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. on december 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $2.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, in notional forward and option contracts outstanding. a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental recognized pretax loss of $12 in 2008 and $29 in 2007, and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of $112 in 2008 and $53 in 2007. this exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the u.s. dollar/ canadian dollar, euro/swiss franc, pound sterling/euro and u.s. dollar/euro exchange rates. we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these forward and option contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations, variable-rate commercial paper and short-term investments. on december 31, 2008, we had $3.1 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and $905 in commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. we have credit facilities with major banks of $1 billion expiring in july 2009 and $975 expiring in december 2011. these facilities are required by rating agencies to support the a1/p1 rating of our commercial paper issuances. we may renew or replace, in whole or in part, the facility that expires in july 2009. commodity price risk we are also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices, primarily on long-term fixed-price contracts. to the extent possible, we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from this risk. some of the protective terms included in our contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract. we have not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant. we do not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years. we held $1.8 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes on december 31, 2008. our marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of aa+. given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of 23 days as of december 31, 2008, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings in either year. historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values. general dynamics 2008 annual report 35 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors an investment in our common stock or debt securities is, of course, subject to risks and uncertainties. investors should consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form 10-k, before deciding whether to purchase our securities. investment risks can be market-wide as well as unique to a specific industry or company. the market risks faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainties faced by investors in a broad range of industries. there are, however, some risks that apply more specifically to general dynamics based on our type of business. because three of our four business groups serve the defense market, our revenues are concentrated with the u.s. government. this customer relationship involves certain unique risks. in addition, our sales to international customers expose us to different financial and legal risks. in our aerospace group market, we face risks tied to u.s. and global economic conditions. despite the varying nature of our u.s. and international defense and business-aviation operations and the markets they serve, each group shares some common risks, such as the ongoing development of high-technology products and the price, availability and quality of commodities and subsystems. we depend on the u.s. government for a significant portion of our revenues. in each of the past three years, over two-thirds of our revenues were from the u.s. government. u.s. defense spending historically has been driven by perceived threats to national security. while the country has been under a sustained elevated threat level in recent years, there is no assurance that defense budgets will continue to grow at the pace seen over the past decade. in addition, competing demands for federal funds could put pressure on all areas of spending, which could impact the defense budget. a decrease in u.s. government defense spending or changes in spending allocation could result in one or more of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated. reductions in our existing programs could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings. u.s. government contracts generally are not fully funded at inception and are subject to termination. our u.s. government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. in february of each year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. from february through september of each year, the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. there are two primary risks associated with this process. first, the process may be delayed or disrupted. changes in congressional schedules, negotiations for program funding levels or unforeseen world events can interrupt the funding for a program or contract. second, future revenues under existing multi-year contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. in addition, u.s. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on future revenues and earnings. our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. our aerospace group business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by u.s. and foreign businesses, the u.s. and other governments, and individual customers. the group future results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets. if our aerospace group is unable to replace contracts terminated due to customer defaults with existing contracts in the backlog or new contracts, the group anticipated revenues and profitability could be reduced as a result. our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. these projections assess: the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance and the timing of product deliveries. if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if we face unexpected contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected. this could affect our earnings and margins. 14 general dynamics 2009

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8, of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of these risks. the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. foreign currency risk we had $1.8 billion in notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding on

remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. on december 31, 2009, we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt. we had no commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of one year. on december 31, 2009, we held $2.6 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes. our marketable securities have an average duration of six months and an average credit rating of aa-. given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of 57 days on december 31, 2009, a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings. historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these

u.s. government. u.s. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors. these agencies review a contractor performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. the u.s. government also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor purchasing, property, estimating, labor, accounting and information systems. in some cases, audits may result in costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations of improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. in addition, we could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. our aerospace group business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by business, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the group future results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the

to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. these activities, particularly in the current environment of increased governmental regulation and enforcement both domestically and abroad, may expose us to legal and regulatory risks that are different from the risks we currently experience in our existing businesses. when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies, and market conditions following the acquisition. although we believe we have established appropriate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks and have a proven track record of successful acquisitions and investments, unanticipated performance issues and acquired liabilities associated with these activities could adversely affect our financial results. general dynamics annual report 2010 15 table of contents forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are

of our programs being reduced, delayed or terminated. reductions in our existing programs could adversely affect our future revenues and earnings. for additional information relating to the current u.s. defense budget, see the business environment section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in part ii, item 7, of this annual report on form 10-k. u.s. government contracts are not always fully funded at inception and are subject to termination. our u.s. government revenues are funded by agency budgets that operate on an october-to-september fiscal year. in february of each year, the president of the united states presents to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. this budget proposes funding levels for every federal agency and is the result of months of policy and program reviews throughout the executive branch. for the remainder of the year, the appropriations and authorization committees of the congress review the president budget proposals and establish the funding levels for the upcoming fiscal year. once these levels are enacted into law, the executive office of the president administers the funds to the agencies. there are two primary risks associated with the u.s. government budget cycle. first, the annual process may be delayed or disrupted. for example, changes in congressional schedules due to elections or other legislative priorities, or negotiations for program funding levels can interrupt the process. if the annual budget is not approved by the end of the government fiscal year, portions of the u.s. government can shut down or operate under a continuing resolution that funds spending at prior year levels, which can impact funding for our programs and timing of new awards. additionally, the congress typically appropriates funds on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years. future revenues under existing multi-year contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. changes in appropriations in subsequent years may impact the funding available for these programs. delays or changes in funding can impact the timing of available funds or lead to changes in program content. in addition, u.s. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate a contract, in whole or in part, for convenience. if a contract is terminated for convenience, a contractor usually is entitled to receive payments for its allowable costs and the proportionate share of fees or earnings for the work performed. the government may also terminate a contract for default in the event of a breach by the contractor. if a contract is terminated for default, the government in most cases pays only for the work it has accepted. the loss of anticipated funding or the termination of multiple or large programs could have an adverse effect on our future revenues and earnings. we are subject to audit by the u.s. government. u.s. government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors. these agencies review a contractor performance under its contracts and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. the u.s. government also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor purchasing, property, estimating, labor, accounting and information systems. in some cases, audits may result in costs not being reimbursed or subject to repayment. if an audit or investigation were to result in allegations of improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the u.s. government. in addition, we could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft. our aerospace group business-jet market is driven by the demand for business-aviation products and services by business, individual and government customers in the united states and around the world. the group future results also depend on other factors, including general economic conditions, the availability of credit and trends in capital goods markets. if customers default on existing contracts and we are unable to replace those contracts, the group anticipated revenues and profitability could be reduced as a result. 14 general dynamics annual report 2011 table of contents our earnings and margins depend on our ability to perform under our contracts. when agreeing to contractual terms, our management team makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. these projections assess: the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and components, and schedule requirements. if there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if we fail to adequately manage the risks under our contracts, the profitability of our contracts may be adversely affected. this could affect our earnings and margins. our earnings and margins depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance. we rely on other companies to provide materials, components and subsystems for our products. subcontractors also perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. we depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet our contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. we often rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. international sales and operations are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries. our international business may pose different risks than our business in the united states. in some countries there is increased chance for economic, legal or political changes. government customers in newly formed free-market economies typically have procurement procedures that are less mature, which may complicate the contracting process. in this context, our international business may be sensitive to changes in a foreign government leadership, national priorities and budgets. international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange-rate variability and differing legal systems. in addition, some international government customers require contractors to agree to specific in-country purchases, manufacturing agreements or financial support arrangements, known as offsets, as a condition for a contract award. the contracts may include penalties if we fail to meet the offset requirements. an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our revenues and earnings associated with our international business. our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products and technologies and maintain a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers. many of the products and services we provide involve sophisticated technologies and engineering, with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes. our customers requirements change and evolve regularly. accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop, manufacture and provide innovative products and services and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. because of the highly specialized nature of our business, we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, our future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected. we have made and expect to continue to make investments, including acquisitions and joint ventures, that involve risks and uncertainties. these activities, particularly in the current environment of increased government regulation and enforcement domestically and abroad, may expose us to legal and regulatory risks that are different from the risks we have experienced in our existing businesses. when evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions, we make judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets and the risks and costs of potential liabilities based on information available to us at the time of the transaction. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions depends on multiple factors, including our integration of the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying products, capabilities or technologies and market conditions following the acquisition. although we believe we have established appropriate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks and have a proven track record of successful acquisitions and investments, unanticipated performance issues and acquired liabilities associated with these activities could adversely affect our financial results, including future charges for impairment of long-lived assets. our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security events and other disruptions. as a defense contractor, we face various cyber security threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our proprietary or classified information, as well as threats to physical security. we also design and manage information technology systems for various customers. we generally face the same security threats for these systems as for our own. accordingly, we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems. if any of these threats materialize, the event could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation and prevent us from being eligible for future work on sensitive or classified systems for u.s. government customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. general dynamics annual report 2011 15 table of contents forward-looking statements this annual report on form 10-k contains forward-looking statements that are based on management expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions. words such as expects, anticipates, plans, believes, scheduled, outlook, estimates, should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these include but are not limited to projections of revenues, earnings, operating margins, segment performance, cash flows, contract awards, aircraft production, deliveries and backlog. forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, as amended. these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. therefore, actual future results and trends may differ materially from what is forecast in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the risk factors discussed in this section. all forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document. all subsequent written and oral

about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk, primarily from foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and investments. see note m to the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii, item 8, of this annual report on form 10-k for a discussion of these risks. the following discussion quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. foreign currency risk. we had notional forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding of $4.2 billion on december 31, 2010, and $4 billion on december 31, 2011. a 10 percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in the following incremental pretax gains and losses: gain (loss) 2010 2011 recognized $ 4 $ (57) unrecognized (289 ) (176) this exchange-rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the u.s. dollar/canadian dollar, euro/canadian dollar and u.s. dollar/euro exchange rates. we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized gains and losses would be offset by corresponding losses and gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. we believe these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. interest rate risk. our financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed-rate long-term debt obligations and variable-rate commercial paper. on december 31, 2011, we had $3.9 billion par value of fixed-rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding. our fixed-rate debt obligations are not putable, and we do not trade these securities in the market. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations. our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed-income securities with an investment-grade rating and a maximum maturity of up to five years. on december 31, 2011, we held $2.9 billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities, which had an aggregate weighted average maturity of less than two months on december 31, 2011. our marketable securities have an average duration of one year and an average credit rating of aa-. a 10 percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the value of the holdings. historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values. general dynamics
