risk factors set forth below are the material risks associated with the purchase and ownership of the company equity and debt securities. as an owner of real estate, the company is subject to certain business risks arising in connection with the underlying real estate, including, among other factors, the following: i) loss of the company tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of its securities. the company elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code commencing with the taxable year beginning january 1, 1992. the company currently intends to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believes that the company current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to qualify as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company control may affect the company ability to qualify as a reit. for example, in order to qualify as a reit, at least 95% of the company gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, and the company must satisfy a number of requirements regarding the composition of the company assets. also, the company must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of the company net taxable income, excluding capital gains. in addition, new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. although the company believes that it is organized and has operated in such a manner, the company can give no assurance that it has qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. if the company loses its reit status, it will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to company stockholders. if the company fails to qualify as a reit: the company would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing its taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; the company also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; and unless the company was entitled to relief under statutory provisions, it could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which the company was disqualified. in addition, if the company fails to qualify as a reit, it would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, the company failure to qualify as a reit could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value 22 table of contents of the company securities. ii) adverse market conditions and competition may impede the company ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain properties. the economic performance and value of the company properties are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of space in properties like those that the company owns, or a reduction in demand for properties like those that the company owns; the attractiveness of the company properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent; competition from other available properties; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. iii) downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on the company performance. the company properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. the company performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally. the market for retail space has been or could be adversely affected by weakness in the national, regional and local economies, the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies, the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector, the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets, and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. to the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to impact market rents for retail space. iv) failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to the company because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise, could impact the company performance. the company performance depends on its ability to collect rent from tenants. at any time, the company tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, the company tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. in addition, lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, the company may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could impact the company performance. v) the company may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. the company cannot give assurance that any tenant that files for bankruptcy protection will continue to pay rent. a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of the company tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by the company to collect pre- 23 table of contents bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the company receives an order permitting it to do so from the bankruptcy court. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay the company efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to the company in full. however, if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, the company would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. any unsecured claim the company holds may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims, and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws which limit the amount of the claim the company can make if a lease is rejected. as a result, it is likely that the company will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds. vi) real estate property investments are illiquid, and therefore the company may not be able to dispose of properties when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, the company may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. vii) we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not, however, succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. in addition, we may face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover their costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that we have begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. viii) there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. these properties may not have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. ix) the company does not have exclusive control over its joint venture investments, so the company is unable to ensure that its objectives will be pursued. the company has invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties, instead of owning directly. these investments involve risks not present in a wholly-owned ownership structure. in these investments, the company does not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company interests or goals, take action contrary to the company interests or otherwise impede the company objectives. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt. x) we have significant international operations that carry additional risks. 24 table of contents we invest in, and conduct, operations outside the united states. the inherent risks that we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. xi) the company financial covenants may restrict its operating and acquisition activities. the company revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which the company senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on the company ability to incur secured and unsecured debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of the company assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict the company ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of the company indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on the company. xii) the company may be subject to environmental regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the company may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in the company property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not the company knew about, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. xiii) the company ability to lease or develop properties is subject to competitive pressures . the company faces competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from individuals and businesses who own real estate, fiduciary accounts and plans and other entities engaged in real estate investment. some of these competitors have greater financial resources than the company does. this results in competition for the acquisition of properties, for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in the company existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. xiv) changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of the company publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of the company publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of the company publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in the company; 25 table of contents the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to the company s; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); the company financial condition and performance; the market perception of the company growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for the company shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the following table presents the company aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of december 31, 2006, with corresponding weighted-average

we are subject to certain business risks including, among other factors, the following: loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; 13 unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities. adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain properties. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent; competition from other available properties; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally. the market for retail space could in the future be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise, could impact our performance. 14 our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. in addition, lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could impact our performance. we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds, if at all. we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that it has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. 15 we have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with us, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt. we may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in losses to us. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. we have significant international operations that carry additional risks. we invest in, and conduct operations outside the united states. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which may have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations, and our financial condition. market conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain it on favorable terms. the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which could materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. we may be subject to environmental regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. we face competition in leasing or developing properties . 16 we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. some of these competitors have greater financial resources than us. this results in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. we invest in mortgage receivables. our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. in the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. 17 our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the following table presents the company aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of december 31, 2007, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. the information is presented in

totaling cad $476.8 million (approximately usd $482.5 million) comprised of real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities, (ii) mexican real estate investments of approximately mxp 8.0 billion (approximately usd $734.8 million) and (iii) chilean real estate investments of approximately 1.6 billion chilean pesos ("clp") (approximately usd $3.0 million). the foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. as of december 31, 2007, the company had no other material exposure to market risk.risk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. 11 we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities. risks related to adverse global market and economic conditions recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with slower growth and tighter credit conditions through the end of 2008. these adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent; competition from other available properties; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. adverse economic conditions have forced some weaker retailers, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and close stores. certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection. these downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. continued store closings or declarations of bankruptcy by our tenants may have a material adverse effect on the company overall performance. adverse general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company ability to attract or retain tenants. 12 our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds, if at all. risks related to our acquisition, development, operation, and sale of real property we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun purs uing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. 13 there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we face competition in leasing or developing properties . we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. risks related to our joint venture and preferred equity investments we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. we have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with us, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. if the co-venturer or partner defaults on their obligations, we may be required to fulfill their obligation ourselves. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. we may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in significant losses to us. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. risks related to our international operations we have significant international operations that carry additional risks. we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 14 risks related to our financing activities we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. risks related to the market price of our publicly traded securities changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. risks related to our marketable securities and mortgage receivables we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. 15 our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. the issuers of our marketable securities also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. we invest in mortgage receivables. our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. risks related to environmental regulations we may be subject to environmental regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. quantitative and qualitative

mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. as of december 31, 2008, the company has no other material exposure to market risk.risk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. 11 table of contents we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities. risks related to adverse global market and economic conditions adverse global market and economic conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties. recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with slower growth and tighter credit conditions. continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and declining real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the u.s. economy. these adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses, maintain our properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. adverse economic conditions have forced some weaker retailers, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and close stores. certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection. these downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. continued store closings or declarations of bankruptcy by our tenants may have a material adverse effect on the company overall performance. adverse general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company ability to attract or retain tenants. lease terminations by certain tenants or a failure by certain tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by ot her tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases, in which case we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. we are unable to predict whether, or to what extent or for how long, these adverse market and economic conditions will persist. the continuation and/or intensification of these conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. during 2009, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $175.1 million, before income taxes and noncontrolling interest, relating to adjustments to property carrying values, investments in real estate joint ventures, real estate under development and other real estate investments. ongoing adverse market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairments in the future. 12 table of contents ongoing adverse market and economic conditions and market volatility will likely continue to make it difficult to value the properties and investments owned by us and our unconsolidated joint ventures. there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation, or in the stability of the value, of such properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in the value thereof. in addition, we intend to sell many of our non-core assets over the next several years. no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent; competition from other available properties; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. 13 table of contents we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. risks related to our acquisition, development, operation, and sale of real property we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fa il to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we face competition in leasing or developing properties . we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. risks related to our joint venture and preferred equity investments we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. 14 table of contents we have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the co-venturer or partner failing to provide capital and fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in signifi cant losses to us. although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. joint ventures have additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and our need for the venture partner continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. we may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in significant losses to us. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. risks related to our international operations we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. 15 table of contents each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. in addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations. our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our international operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, and we can predict neither the impact of associated requirements to which our international operations may be subject nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations are subject to a variety of u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa. we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of business ethics or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. risks related to our financing activities we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. 16 table of contents adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. risks related to the market price of our publicly traded securities changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in our stock. under recent irs guidance, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011, and in some cases declared as late as december 31,2012, could be payable in our stock if certain conditions are met. although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so. in the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable u.s. stockholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such stockholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. if a u.s. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the div idend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. furthermore, with respect to non-u.s. stockholders, we may be required to withhold u.s. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. in addition, if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness and preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. risks related to our marketable securities and mortgage receivables we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: 17 table of contents limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. the issuers of our marketable securities also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. we invest in mortgage receivables. our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. risks related to environmental regulations we may be subject to environmental regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the following table presents the company aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of december 31, 2009, with corresponding weighted-average interest rates sorted by maturity date. the table does not include extension options where available. amounts include fair value purchase price allocation adjustments for assumed debt. the information

totaling cad $473.1 million (approximately usd $449.6 million) comprised of real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities, (ii) mexican real estate investments of approximately mxp 8.5 billion (approximately usd $641.2 million), (iii) chilean real estate investments of approximately 14.5 billion chilean pesos (approximately usd $27.2 million), (iv) peruvian real estate investments of approximately 7.3 million peruvian nuevo sol (approximately usd $2.5 million), (v) brazilian real estate investments of approximately 53.0 million brazilian real ( brl ) (approximately usd $30.5 million) and (vi) australian investments in marketable securities of approximately aud 191.1 million (approximately usd $149.4 million). the foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. as of december 31, 2009, the company has no other material exposure to market risk. 69 table of contentsrisk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. 11 table of contents we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities. risks related to adverse global market and economic conditions adverse global market and economic conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties. recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with slower growth and tighter credit conditions. continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and declining real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the u.s. economy. these adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses, maintain our properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. adverse economic conditions have forced some weaker retailers, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and close stores. certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection. these downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. continued store closings or declarations of bankruptcy by our tenants may have a material adverse effect on the company overall performance. adverse general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company ability to attract or retain tenants. lease terminations by certain tenants or a failure by certain tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by ot her tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases, in which case we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. we are unable to predict whether, or to what extent or for how long, these adverse market and economic conditions will persist. the continuation and/or intensification of these conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. during 2009, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $175.1 million, before income taxes and noncontrolling interest, relating to adjustments to property carrying values, investments in real estate joint ventures, real estate under development and other real estate investments. ongoing adverse market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairments in the future. 12 table of contents ongoing adverse market and economic conditions and market volatility will likely continue to make it difficult to value the properties and investments owned by us and our unconsolidated joint ventures. there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation, or in the stability of the value, of such properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in the value thereof. in addition, we intend to sell many of our non-core assets over the next several years. no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent; competition from other available properties; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. 13 table of contents we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. risks related to our acquisition, development, operation, and sale of real property we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fa il to recover expenses already

engaged in real estate investment. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. risks related to our joint venture and preferred equity investments we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. 14 table of contents we have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our

performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. risks related to our international operations we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative

however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our international operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, and we can predict neither the impact of associated requirements to which our international operations may be subject nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations are subject to a variety of u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa. we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of business ethics or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. risks related to our financing activities we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. 16 table of contents adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. risks related to the market price of our publicly traded securities changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in our stock. under recent irs guidance, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011, and in some cases declared as late as december 31,2012, could be payable in our stock if certain conditions are met. although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so. in the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable u.s. stockholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such stockholders might have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. if a u.s. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the div idend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. furthermore, with respect to non-u.s. stockholders, we may be required to withhold u.s. tax with respect to such dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. in addition, if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness and preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. risks related to our marketable securities and mortgage receivables we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: 17 table of contents limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. the issuers of our marketable securities also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. we invest in mortgage receivables. our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. risks related to environmental regulations we may be subject to environmental regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the following table presents the company aggregate fixed rate and variable rate domestic and foreign debt obligations outstanding as of december 31, 2009, with corresponding weighted-average

totaling cad $473.1 million (approximately usd $449.6 million) comprised of real estate joint venture investments and marketable securities, (ii) mexican real estate investments of approximately mxp 8.5 billion (approximately usd $641.2 million), (iii) chilean real estate investments of approximately 14.5 billion chilean pesos (approximately usd $27.2 million), (iv) peruvian real estate investments of approximately 7.3 million peruvian nuevo sol (approximately usd $2.5 million), (v) brazilian real estate investments of approximately 53.0 million brazilian real ( brl ) (approximately usd $30.5 million) and (vi) australian investments in marketable securities of approximately aud 191.1 million (approximately usd $149.4 million). the foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. as of december 31, 2009, the company has no other material exposure to market risk. 69 table of contentsrisk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. 11 table of contents we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a reit and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a reit. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. if we fail to qualify as a reit: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities. risks related to adverse global market and economic conditions adverse global market and economic conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties. recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with slower growth and tighter credit conditions. continued concerns about the systemic impact of the availability and cost of credit, the u.s. mortgage market, inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues and declining real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for the u.s. economy. these adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses, maintain our properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions. adverse economic conditions have forced some weaker retailers, in some cases, to declare bankruptcy and close stores. certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection. these downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. continued store closings or declarations of bankruptcy by our tenants may have a material adverse effect on the company overall performance. adverse general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company ability to attract or retain tenants. lease terminations by certain tenants or a failure by certain tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by ot her tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases, in which case we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. we are unable to predict whether, or to what extent or for how long, these adverse market and economic conditions will persist. the continuation and/or intensification of these conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay expenses, maintain properties, pay dividends and refinance debt. during 2009, the company recognized non-cash impairment charges of approximately $175.1 million, before income taxes and noncontrolling interest, relating to adjustments to property carrying values, investments in real estate joint ventures, real estate under development and other real estate investments. ongoing adverse market and economic conditions could cause us to recognize additional impairments in the future. 12 table of contents ongoing adverse market and economic conditions and market volatility will likely continue to make it difficult to value the properties and investments owned by us and our unconsolidated joint ventures. there may be significant uncertainty in the valuation, or in the stability of the value, of such properties and investments that could result in a substantial decrease in the value thereof. in addition, we intend to sell many of our non-core assets over the next several years. no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize additional impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent; competition from other available properties; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet. failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise could impact our performance. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. 13 table of contents we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. risks related to our acquisition, development, operation, and sale of real property we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fa il to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. there is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we face competition in leasing or developing properties . we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. risks related to our joint venture and preferred equity investments we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. 14 table of contents we have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the co-venturer or partner failing to provide capital and fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in signifi cant losses to us. although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. joint ventures have additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and our need for the venture partner continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. we may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in significant losses to us. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. risks related to our international operations we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. we invest in and conduct operations outside the united states. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. 15 table of contents each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. in addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations. our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our international operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, and we can predict neither the impact of associated requirements to which our international operations may be subject nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations are subject to a variety of u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa. we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of business ethics or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. risks related to our financing activities we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile and constrained as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. 16 table of contents adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. risks related to the market price of our publicly traded securities changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in our stock. under recent irs guidance, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011, and in some cases declared as late as december 31,2012, could be payable in our stock if certain conditions are met. although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently have no intent to do so. in the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable u.s. stockholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such stockholders might have to pay the tax

dividend, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. in addition, if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, funds from operations, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness and preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. risks related to our marketable securities and mortgage receivables we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: 17 table of contents limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to

declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. the issuers of our marketable securities also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. we invest in mortgage receivables. our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. risks related to environmental regulations we may be subject to environmental regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk exposure is interest rate

mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. as of december 31, 2009, the company has no other material exposure to market risk. 69 table of contentsrisk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we believe we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit. however, there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. in order to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, such as rents from real property. also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests. to qualify as a reit, the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements. the failure of a subsidiary reit to fail to qualify as a reit, could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business, raise capital and could materially adversely affect the value of our securities. 5 to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions. to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income each year, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit d istribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent, particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations; tenants who may declare bankruptcy and/or close stores; competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties, generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance therefore is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; and the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets. in addition, numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. new regional malls, open-air lifestyle centers, or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal. retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers, e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, direct mail, telemarketing and home shopping networks, all of which could (i) reduce rents payable to us; (ii) reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties; and (iii) lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties. we may fail to anticipate the effects on our properties of changes in consumer buying practices, particularly of sales over the internet and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent. 6 our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, our tenants financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management tim e to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. we face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. we have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or 7 otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties, including the risk of the co-venturer or partner failing to provide capital and fulfilling its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, the risk of conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. joint ventures have additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and our need for the venture partner continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. we intend to sell many of our non-retail assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us. no assurance can be given that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our non-retail properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us. we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. in addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations. our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8 we can predict neither the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations are subject to a variety of u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa. we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject, the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of business ethics or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to us; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. 9 we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock. we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in cash and partially payable in our stock. under irs guidance, up to 90% of any such taxable dividend with respect to calendar years 2008 through 2011, and in some cases declared as late as december 31, 2012, could be payable in our stock if certain conditions are met. although we reserve the right to utilize this procedure in the future, we currently do not intend to do so. in the event that we pay a portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our accumulated earnings and profits for united states federal income tax purposes. as a result, taxable u.s. stockholders would be required to pay tax on the entire amount of the dividend, including the portion paid in shares of common stock, in which case such stockholders might have to pay the tax usi ng cash from other sources. if a u.s. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. furthermore, with respect to non-u.s. stockholders, we may be required to withhold u.s. tax with respect to such dividend, including all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. in addition, if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, such sales would put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. we may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. 10 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the following table presents the company aggregate fixed rate

to, the following: loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for

distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities. 5 to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions. to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income each year, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain our properties. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate, including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; trends toward smaller store sizes as retailers reduce inventory and new prototypes; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent, particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations; tenants who may declare bankruptcy and/or close stores; competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance therefore, is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; the impact of internet sales on the demand for reatil space; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; and the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets. in addition, numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. new regional malls, open-air lifestyle centers, or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal. retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers, e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, direct mail, telemarketing or home shopping networks, all of which could (i) reduce rents payable to us; (ii) reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties; or (iii) lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties. we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices, particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, our tenants financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties. 6 at any time our tenants , particularly small local stores, may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of our leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our performance. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code restricts a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. these properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. we have invested in some properties as a co-venturer or partner, instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties. the co-venturer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. 7 although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. joint ventures implicate additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. we intend to sell many of our non-retail assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our non-retail properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect us. we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. in addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations. our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. 8 our international operations are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act, ( fcpa ). we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject, the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply with these requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms. the inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; or we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities, including securities issued by other real estate companies; our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 9 we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility, resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. we may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.

purposes. as of december 31, 2011, the company has no other material exposure to market risk. 31risk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit. however, there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. in order to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources, such as rents from real property. also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests. to qualify as a reit, the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements. the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit. 5 if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities. to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions. to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income each year, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate, including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; trends

insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction

involve risks and uncertainties. the co-venturer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. joint ventures implicate additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner's continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable to us if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners' business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. we intend to sell many of our non-retail and non-strategic assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our non-retail and/or non-strategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. 8 each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. in addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations. our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations include properties in canada, mexico, chile, brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ). we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject, the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply or violations of any applicable policies, anti-corruption laws, or other legal requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures. we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec's investigation, in the matter of wal-mart stores, inc. (fw-3678), that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa. see item 3. legal proceedings, below. the u.s. department of justice and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations, which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. any of these remedial measures, if applicable to us, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks, loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches. such cyber attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. while we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats including password protection, backup servers and annual penetration testing, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack. cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants, employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations. we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to fund our indebtedness; or we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. 9 adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the indentures and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities, including securities issued by other real estate companies; our financial condition and performance; the market's perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility, resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. 10 our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. we may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk exposure is interest

foreign investments as of december 31, 2012. investment amounts are shown in their respective local currencies and the u.s. dollar equivalents: foreign investment (in millions) country local currency

mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. as of december 31, 2012, the company has no other material exposure to market risk. 35risk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit. however, there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. 5 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. in order to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources, such as rents from real property. also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests. to qualify as a reit, the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements. the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities. to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions. to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income each year, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate, including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; trends toward smaller store sizes as retailers reduce inventory and new prototypes; increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent, particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations; tenants who may declare bankruptcy and/or close stores; competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; acts of terrorism and war, acts of god and physical and weather-related damage to our properties; and the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time. 6 competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance, therefore, is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; and the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets. in addition, numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. new regional malls, open-air lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal. retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers, e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, direct mail, telemarketing or home shopping networks, all of which could (i) reduce rents payable to us; (ii) reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties; or (iii) lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties. we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices, particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants' businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, our tenants' financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties. at any time our tenants, particularly small local stores, may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants' leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants' leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us. real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code restricts a reit's ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need. 7 we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies, and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management's attention from other activities. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management's time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. newly acquired or re-developed properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties, particularly in secondary markets. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. we have invested in some properties as a co-venturer or partner, instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties. the co-venturer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. joint ventures implicate additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner's continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable to us if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners' business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. we intend to continue to sell our non-retail and non-strategic assets over the next several years and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our non-retail and/or non-strategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 8 we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements, including changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. currency fluctuations between local currency and the u.s. dollar during the period in which the company held its investment result in a cumulative translation adjustment ( cta ), which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( aoci ) on the company's consolidated balance sheets. the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates. changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company's cta balance. the company's aggregate cta net loss balance at december 31, 2013 is $91.0 million. based on the company's foreign investment balances at december 31, 2013, a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $92.2 million, whereas, an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $75.4 million. under u.s. gaap, the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity. during 2013, the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio and the company may, in the near term, substantially liquidate all of its investments in this portfolio which will require the then unrealized loss on foreign currency translation to be recognized as a charge against earnings. at december 31, 2013, the aggregate cta net loss balance relating to the company's latin american portfolio is $114.7 million. based on the company's foreign investment balances in latin americas at december 31, 2013, a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $48.2 million, whereas, an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $39.4 million. in order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. in addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. since a meaningful portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote substantial resources to managing our international operations. our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations include properties in canada, mexico, chile, brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ). we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject, the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply or violations of any applicable policies, anti-corruption laws, or other legal requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures. we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec's investigation, in the matter of wal-mart stores, inc. (fw-3678), that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa. we are cooperating with the sec investigation and a parallel investigation by the u.s. department of justice ( doj ). see item 3. legal proceedings, below. the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations, which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. any of these remedial measures, if applicable to us, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks, loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches. such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. while we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats including password protection, backup servers and annual penetration testing, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants, employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations. 9 we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. w e cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to fund our indebtedness; or we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. we are subject to financial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facility, term loans and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility, term loans and the indentures and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. as with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities, including securities issued by other real estate companies; our financial condition and performance; the market's perception of our growth potential, potential future cash dividends and risk profile; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 10 we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility, resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. in these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. we may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.

presents the company's foreign investments and respective cumulative translation adjustment ( cta ) as of december 31, 2013. investment amounts are shown in their respective local currencies and the u.s. dollar equivalents and cta balances are shown in us dollars: foreign investment (in millions) country local currency us dollars cta gain/(loss) mexican real estate investments (mxn) 4,775.6 $ 365.0 $ (106.8 ) canadian real estate joint venture investments (cad) 420.4 $ 395.8 $ 23.7 chilean real estate investments (clp) 33,178.3 $ 63.3 $ (8.0 ) peruvian real estate investments (peruvian nuevo sol) 15.6 $ 5.6 $ 0.1 the foreign currency exchange risk has been partially mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 35 cta results from currency fluctuations between local currency and the u.s. dollar during the period in which the company held its investment and is recorded as a component of aoci on the company's consolidated balance sheets. the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates. changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company's cta balance. based on the company's foreign investment balances at december 31, 2013, a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $92.2 million, whereas, an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $75.4 million. under u.s. gaap, the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity. during 2013, the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio and the company may, in the near term, substantially liquidate all of its investments in this portfolio which will require the then unrealized loss on foreign currency translation to be recognized as a charge against earnings. at december 31, 2013, the aggregate cta net loss balance relating to the company's latin american portfolio is $114.7 million. based on the company's foreign investment balances in latin americas at december 31, 2013, a favorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would decrease the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $48.2 million, whereas, an unfavorable overall exchange rate fluctuation of 10% would increase the aggregate cta net loss balance by approximately $39.4 million.risk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust or changes in federal tax laws, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to real estate investment trusts could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code. we believe that we have operated so as to qualify as a reit under the code and that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit. however, there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes. 5 qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. in order to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources, such as rents from real property. also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes under the code. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests. to qualify as a reit, the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements. the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. as a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a reit or changes in federal tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and materially adversely affect the value of our securities. to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds on a short-term basis during unfavorable market conditions. to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our reit taxable income each year, excluding capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income each year. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate, including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; trends toward smaller store sizes as retailers reduce inventory and new prototypes; increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent, particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations; tenants who may declare bankruptcy and/or close stores; competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the expenses of owning and operating properties, which are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; acts of terrorism and war, acts of god and physical and weather-related damage to our properties; and the potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time. 6 competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties. our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance, therefore, is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. in the future, the market for retail space could be adversely affected by: weakness in the national, regional and local economies; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; the impact of internet sales on the demand for retail space; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; and the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets. in addition, numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. new regional malls, open-air lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal. retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers, e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, catalog companies, direct mail, telemarketing or home shopping networks, all of which could (i) reduce rents payable to us; (ii) reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties; or (iii) lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties. we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices, particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants' businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, our tenants' financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties. at any time our tenants, particularly small local stores, may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants' leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants' leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us . real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. in addition, the federal tax code restricts a reit's ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a time frame that we would need. 7 we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies , and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or ground-up development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management's attention from other activities. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management's time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. newly acquired or re-developed properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties, particularly in secondary markets. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. we face competition in pursuing acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. we face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. we have invested in some properties as a co-venturer or partner, instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties. the co-venturer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments, conflicts arising between us and our partners and the difficulty of managing and resolving such conflicts, and the difficulty of managing or otherwise monitoring such business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. although our joint venture arrangements may allow us to share risks with our joint-venture partners, these arrangements may also decrease our ability to manage risk. joint ventures implicate additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner's continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable to us if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners' business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. 8 we intend to continue to sell our non-strategic assets and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our non-strategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we have significant international operations, which may be affected by economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our business. the risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: currency risks, including currency fluctuations; unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements, including changes in applicable laws and regulations in the united states that affect foreign operations; potential adverse tax burdens; burdens of complying with different accounting and permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; regional, national and local political uncertainty; economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures; and reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. currency fluctuations between local currency and the u.s. dollar during the period in which the company held its investment result in a cumulative translation adjustment ( cta ), which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( aoci ) on the company's consolidated balance sheets. the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates. changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company's cta balance. the company's aggregate cta net gain balance at december 31, 2014, is $0.3 million, this amount consists of unrealized gains in canada aggregating $15.2 million, offset by unrealized losses in chile aggregating $14.9 million. under u.s. gaap, the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity. during 2013, the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio and during the fourth quarter 2014 the company substantially liquidated its investment in mexico and peru and recognized a loss from foreign currency translation in the amount of $140.1 million before noncontrolling interest of $5.8 million. the company may, in the near term, substantially liquidate its investment in chile which will require the then unrealized loss on foreign currency translation to be recognized as a charge against earnings. in order to fully develop our international operations, we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices. in addition, we are required to create compensation programs, employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries. we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives in our international locations. our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures. since a portion of our revenues are generated internationally, we must devote an appropriate level of resources to managing our international operations. our future success will be influenced by our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. any of these factors could, however, materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting our international operations nor the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations include properties in canada, mexico and chile and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act ( fcpa ). we have policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with the fcpa and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject, the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. 9 we cannot assure you that our employees will adhere to our code of conduct or any other of our policies, applicable anti-corruption laws, including the fcpa, or other legal requirements. failure to comply or violations of any applicable policies, anti-corruption laws, or other legal requirements may subject us to legal, regulatory or other sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures. we have received a subpoena from the enforcement division of the sec in connection with the sec's investigation, in the matter of wal-mart stores, inc. (fw-3678), that the sec staff is currently conducting with respect to possible violations of the fcpa. we are cooperating with the sec investigation and a parallel investigation by the u.s. department of justice ( doj ). see item 3. legal proceedings, below. the doj and the sec have a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under the fcpa and other laws and regulations, which they may seek to impose against corporations and individuals in appropriate circumstances including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, fines, penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. any of these remedial measures, if applicable to us, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks, loss of confidential information and other business disruptions. our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and other electronic security breaches. such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. while we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats including password protection, backup servers and annual penetration testing, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber-attack. cybersecurity incidents could compromise the confidential information of our tenants, employees and third party vendors and disrupt and effect the efficiency of our business operations. we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. w e cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital and credit markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our business strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to fund our indebtedness; or we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. we are subject to f inancial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facility, term loan and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility, term loan and the indentures and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities, including securities issued by other real estate companies; our financial condition and performance; the market's perception of our growth potential, potential future cash dividends and risk profile; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. 10 we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws. any change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. we may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities mortgage receivables or other investments , which may result in significant losses to us. our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in significant losses to us. marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. as a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; substantial market price volatility, resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn. these risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. where that occurs, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. the economic performance and value of our other investments, which we do not control and are in retail operations, are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses, including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites; and ongoing consolidation in the retail sector. a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment ( otti ) against such assets. when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date, we assess whether the decline is temporary or other-than-temporary. if we intend to sell an impaired asset, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery, then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the assets amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date. when an otti is recognized through earnings, a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value. 11 we may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company's primary market risk

has been partially mitigated, but not eliminated, through the use of local currency denominated debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. currency fluctuations between local currency and the u.s. dollar during the period in which the company held its investment result in a cta, which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ( aoci ) on the company's consolidated balance sheets. the cta amounts are subject to future changes resulting from ongoing fluctuations in the respective foreign currency exchange rates. changes in exchange rates are impacted by many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. any change could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the company's cta balance. the company's aggregate cta net gain balance at december 31, 2014, is $0.3 million. 34 under u.s. gaap, the company is required to release cta balances into earnings when the company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity. during 2013, the company began selling properties within its latin american portfolio. during the year ended december 31, 2014, the company continued selling properties in its latin american portfolio and as a result substantially liquidated its investments in mexico and peru. due to the substantial liquidation of its investments in mexico and peru, the company recognized a loss from foreign currency translation in the aggregate amount of $134.4 million, after noncontrolling interest of $5.8

adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties. our properties consist primarily of open-air shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance, therefore, is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate, including but not limited to: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; trends toward smaller store sizes as retailers reduce inventory and new prototypes; increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent, particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations; tenants who may declare bankruptcy and/or close stores; competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the expenses of owning and operating properties, which are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; acts of terrorism and war, acts of god and physical and weather-related damage to our properties; and the risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time. 6 table of contents competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties. numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. new regional malls, open-air lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal. retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers, e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, direct mail, telemarketing or home shopping networks, all of which could (i) reduce rents payable to us; (ii) reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties; or (iii) lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties. we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices, particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants&rsquo; businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent. we face competition in the acquisition or development of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment or development opportunities. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, including anchor tenants, our tenants&rsquo; financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants&rsquo; leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants&rsquo; leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants, including anchor tenants, or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly involving a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us . real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. the capitalization rates at which properties may be sold could be higher than historic rates, thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale. in addition, the code restricts a reit&rsquo;s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a timeframe that we would need. all of these factors reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. certain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a taxable gain on sale. we intend to utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions. in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies , and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management&rsquo;s attention from other activities. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management&rsquo;s time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. 7 table of contents newly acquired or re-developed properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties, particularly in secondary markets. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. unsuccessful real estate under development activities or a slowdown in real estate under development activities could have a direct impact on our growth, results of operations and cash flows. real estate under development is a component of our operating and investment strategy. we intend to continue pursuing select real estate under development opportunities for long-term investment and construction of retail, residential and/or mixed-use properties as opportunities arise. we expect to phase in construction until sufficient preleasing is reached. our real estate under development and construction activities include the following risks: we may abandon real estate under development opportunities after expending resources and could lose all or part of our investment in such opportunities, including loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred development, construction or operating costs, including increased interest rates and higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, may exceed our original estimates occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet our expectations and may not be sufficient to make the property profitable construction or permanent financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all we may not complete construction and lease-up on schedule due to a variety of factors including construction delays or contractor changes, resulting in increased expenses and construction costs or tenants or operators with the right to terminate pre-construction leases; and we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. additionally, new real estate under development activities typically require substantial time and attention from management, and the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties could require several years to realize any significant cash return. the foregoing risks could hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. we operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as &ldquo;mixed-use&rdquo; developments. this means that in addition to the development of retail space, the project may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes. we have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do with retail real estate. as a result, if a development project includes a non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience developing properties for such use or partner with such a developer. if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-retail real estate. in addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves (including providing any necessary financing). in the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. we will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. in the case of office properties, the risks also include changes in space utilization by tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business culture, declines in financial condition of these tenants and competition for credit worthy office tenants. in the case of hotel properties, the risks also include increases in inflation and utilities that may not be offset by increases in room rates. we are also dependent on business and commercial travelers and tourism. because we have less experience with residential, office and hotel properties than with retail properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential properties. if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third-party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us. construction and development projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion. in the event that we decide to develop and construct new properties or redevelop existing properties, we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development. these risks include, but are not limited to, risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning, land-use, building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations, risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups, risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization, risks related to construction labor disruptions, adverse weather, acts of god or shortages of materials which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8 table of contents we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. we have invested in some properties as a co-venturer or partner, instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties. the co-venturer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments. conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage and/or resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. in addition, joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner&rsquo;s continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable to us if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners&rsquo; business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. we may not be able to recover our investments in mortgage receivables or other investments , which may result in significant losses to us. in the event of a default by a borrower, it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. a decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. in these instances, we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. where that occurs, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. in the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected. the economic performance and value of our other investments which we do not control and are in retail operations, are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses, including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites; and ongoing consolidation in the retail sector. a decline in the value of our other investments may require us to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment (&ldquo;otti&rdquo;) against such assets. when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date, we assess whether the decline is temporary or other-than-temporary. if we intend to sell an impaired asset, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery, then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the asset&rsquo;s amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date. when an otti is recognized through earnings, a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value. 9 table of contents we intend to continue to sell our non-strategic assets and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our non-strategic properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico, south america and canada, however, we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations have included properties in canada, mexico, chile, brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act (&ldquo;fcpa&rdquo;) and foreign tax laws and regulations. although we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico, south america and canada, we cannot assure you that our past or any current international operations will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted, or when, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations. we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks which could adversely affect o ur business , cause loss of confidential information and disrupt operations . a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. more specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information. we may face cyber incidents and security breaches through malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a cybersecurity breach or disruption, particularly through a cyber incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. while we maintain some of our own critical information technology systems, we also depend on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions, such as payroll, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. our measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, including password protection, firewalls, backup servers, threat monitoring and periodic penetration testing, may not be successful in preventing a data breach or limiting the effects of a breach. furthermore, the security measures employed by third-party service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems. the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and private data exposure. our financial results may be negatively impacted by such an incident or resulting negative media attention. a cyber incident could: disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy and damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants, investors and associates. moreover, cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants, including unauthorized access to customers&rsquo; credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. 10 table of contents we may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, snow storms, floods and fires. the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operation costs, increase costs for future property insurance, negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space and cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance coverage. if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. risks related to our debt and equity securities we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations and our financial condition. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit and/or equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our investment strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to fund our indebtedness; or we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stakeholders. adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. we are subject to f inancial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the indentures and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. impacts from transition away from london inter-bank offered rate (&ldquo;libor&rdquo;). a portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor for deposits of u.s. dollars. libor and certain other interest &ldquo;benchmarks&rdquo; may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. the united kingdom&rsquo;s financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021, and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve. if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities, including securities issued by other real estate companies; our financial condition and performance; the market&rsquo;s perception of our growth potential, potential future cash dividends and risk profile; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. 11 table of contents we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws. any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. risks related to our status as a reit and related u.s. federal income tax matters loss of our tax status as a reit or changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to reits could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the code. we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a reit under the code. however, there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. the rules dealing with u.s. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and u.s. department of the treasury. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the u.s. federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. in order to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year be derived from qualifying sources, such as &ldquo;rents from real property.&rdquo; also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the code. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests. to qualify as a reit, the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements. the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit. if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to the regular u.s. federal corporate income tax; we could possibly be subject to increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. moreover, the tax cuts and jobs act, enacted on december 22, 2017, has significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. changes made by the legislation that could affect us and our stockholders include: temporarily reducing individual u.s. federal income tax rates on ordinary income; the highest individual u.s. federal income tax rate has been reduced from 39.6% to 37% (excluding the 3.8% medicare tax on net investment income) for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; permanently eliminating the progressive corporate tax rate structure, with a maximum corporate tax rate of 35%, and replacing it with a flat corporate tax rate of 21%; allowing a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received by our stockholders from us that are not designated by us as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, which will allow individuals, trusts, and estates to deduct up to 20% of such amounts for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026; reit dividends, as described herein, will be allowed the full 20% deduction thereby reducing the highest marginal income tax rate on these dividends to 29.6% from 37% (excluding the 3.8% medicare tax on net investment income); 12 table of contents reducing the highest rate of withholding with respect to our distributions to non-u.s. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gains from the sale or exchange of u.s. real property interests from 35% to 21%; limiting our deduction for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 to 80% of reit taxable income (after the application of the dividends paid deduction); generally limiting the deduction for net business interest expense in excess of 30% of a business&rsquo;s adjusted taxable income, except for taxpayers that engage in certain real estate businesses and elect out of this rule (and requiring such electing taxpayers to use the less favorable alternative depreciation system); and elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax. many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. in addition, it is unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses u.s. federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us. we urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock. our failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation or changes in u.s. federal income tax laws (including interpretations and regulations with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act), and with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification, could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and have a materially adverse effect on the value of our securities. to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions , and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, may cause us to curtail our inves tment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock . to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100% of our net taxable income each year, including capital gains. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for u.s. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments. these sources, however, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, the market price of our common stock, and our current and potential future earnings. we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock. the tax imposed on reits engaging in &ldquo;prohibited transactions&rdquo; may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for u.s. federal income tax purposes. a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company&rsquo;s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate protection agreements which mitigate, but do not eliminate, the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating-rate debt. the company has not, and does not plan to, enter into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. the following table presents the company&rsquo;s aggregate fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations outstanding, including

years ended december 31, 2018 and 2016, respectively. (2) includes impairment charge of $0.6 million (mxp 11.0 million) related to pending sale of land parcel for the year ended december 31, 2018. in addition, includes equity losses of $5.2 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 related to foreign investments for which the reporting currency is denominated in usd and not subject to foreign translation exposure. at december 31, 2018, the company&rsquo;s foreign real estate investments in their local currency had an aggregate carrying amount of 39.7 million mexican pesos (usd $4.1 million). currency fluctuations between local currency and the u.s. dollar for the company&rsquo;s foreign monetary assets and liabilities result in foreign currency gains/losses which are recognized in other income, net in the company&rsquo;s consolidated statements of income. during the year ended december 31, 2018, the company recognized a net foreign currency loss of $0.2 million.risk factors 6 risk factors we are subject to certain business and legal risks including, but not limited to, the following: 6 table of contents risks related to our business and operations adverse global market and economic conditions may impede our ability to generate sufficient income and maintain our properties. our properties consist primarily of open-air shopping centers and other retail properties. our performance, therefore, is generally linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space. the economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate, including but not limited to: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; trends toward smaller store sizes as retailers reduce inventory and develop new prototypes; increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites; the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; the ability of tenants to pay rent, particularly anchor tenants with leases in multiple locations; tenants who may declare bankruptcy and/or close stores; competition from other available properties to attract and retain tenants; changes in market rental rates; the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; the expenses of owning and operating properties, which are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; acts of terrorism and war, acts of god and physical and weather-related damage to our properties; success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel; and the risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time. competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties or generate sufficient income from tenants and may decrease the occupancy and rental rates for our properties. numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition. new regional malls, open-air lifestyle centers or other retail shopping centers with more convenient locations or better rents may attract tenants or cause them to seek more favorable lease terms at or prior to renewal. retailers at our properties may face increasing competition from other retailers, e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, direct mail, telemarketing or home shopping networks, all of which could (i) reduce rents payable to us; (ii) reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties; or (iii) lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties. we may fail to anticipate the effects of changes in consumer buying practices, particularly of growing online sales and the resulting retailing practices and space needs of our tenants or a general downturn in our tenants businesses, which may cause tenants to close stores or default in payment of rent. we face competition in the acquisition or development of real property from others engaged in real estate investment that could increase our costs associated with purchasing and maintaining assets. some of these competitors may have greater financial resources than we do. this could result in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment or development opportunities. our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants, including anchor tenants, our tenants financial condition and our tenants maintaining leases for our properties. at any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. as a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. any of these actions could result in the termination of tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to these tenants leases. in the event of a default by a tenant, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under the terms of the leases. in addition, multiple lease terminations by tenants, including anchor tenants, or a failure by multiple tenants to occupy their premises in a shopping center could result in lease terminations or significant reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. in that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all, and our rental payments from our continuing tenants could significantly decrease. the occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly involving a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 7 table of contents a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. a bankruptcy filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. as a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold, if at all. our expenses may remain constant or increase, even if income from our combined shopping center portfolio decreases, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. costs associated with our business, such as common area expenses, utilities, insurance, real estate taxes, mortgage payments, and corporate expenses are relatively inflexible and generally do not decrease in the event that a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease. in addition, inflation could result in higher operating costs. if we are unable to lower our operating costs when revenues decline and/or are unable to pass along cost increases to our tenants, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. we may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on terms favorable to us . real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. the capitalization rates at which properties may be sold could be higher than historic rates, thereby reducing our potential proceeds from sale. in addition, the code includes certain restrictions on a reit ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. therefore, we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on terms favorable to us within a timeframe that we would need. all of these factors reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. certain properties we own have a low tax basis, which may result in a taxable gain on sale. we may utilize 1031 exchanges to mitigate taxable income; however, there can be no assurance that we will identify properties that meet our investment objectives for acquisitions. in the event that we do not utilize 1031 exchanges, we may be required to distribute the gain proceeds to shareholders or pay income tax, which may reduce our cash flow available to fund our commitments. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies , and this may create risks. we may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. we may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. when we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert management attention from other activities. acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. we may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that management has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and will have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware of at the time of the acquisition. in addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. newly acquired or re-developed properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. it is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. as we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. in addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. we may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties, particularly in secondary markets. also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. unsuccessful real estate under development activities or a slowdown in real estate under development activities could have a direct impact on our growth, results of operations and cash flows. real estate under development is a component of our operating and investment strategy. we intend to continue pursuing select real estate under development opportunities for long-term investment and construction of retail, residential and/or mixed-use properties as opportunities arise. we expect to phase in construction until sufficient preleasing is reached. our real estate under development and construction activities include the following risks: we may abandon real estate under development opportunities after expending resources and could lose all or part of our investment in such opportunities, including loss of deposits or failure to recover expenses already incurred development, construction or operating costs, including increased interest rates and higher materials, transportation, labor, leasing or other costs, may exceed our original estimates 8 table of contents occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not meet our expectations and may not be sufficient to make the property profitable construction or permanent financing may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all we may not complete construction and lease-up on schedule due to a variety of factors including construction delays or contractor changes, resulting in increased expenses and construction costs or tenants or operators with the right to terminate pre-construction leases; and we may not be able to obtain, or may experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations. additionally, new real estate under development activities typically require substantial time and attention from management, and the time frame required for development, construction and lease-up of these properties could require several years to realize any significant cash return. the foregoing risks could hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we face risks associated with the development of mixed-use commercial properties. we operate, are currently developing, and may in the future develop, properties either alone or through joint ventures with other persons that are known as mixed-use developments. this means that in addition to the development of retail space, the project may also include space for residential, office, hotel or other commercial purposes. we have less experience in developing and managing non-retail real estate than we do with retail real estate. as a result, if a development project includes a non-retail use, we may seek to develop that component ourselves, sell the rights to that component to a third-party developer with experience developing properties for such use or partner with such a developer. if we do not sell the rights or partner with such a developer, or if we choose to develop the other component ourselves, we would be exposed not only to those risks typically associated with the development of commercial real estate generally, but also to specific risks associated with the development and ownership of non-retail real estate. in addition, even if we sell the rights to develop the other component or elect to participate in the development through a joint venture, we may be exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the other party to complete the development as expected. these include the risk that the other party would default on its obligations necessitating that we complete the other component ourselves, including providing any necessary financing. in the case of residential properties, these risks include competition for prospective residents from other operators whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. we will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. in the case of office properties, the risks also include changes in space utilization by tenants due to technology, economic conditions and business culture, declines in financial condition of these tenants and competition for credit worthy office tenants. in the case of hotel properties, the risks also include increases in inflation and utilities that may not be offset by increases in room rates. we are also dependent on business and commercial travelers and tourism. because we have less experience with residential, office and hotel properties than with retail properties, we expect to retain third parties to manage our residential and other non-retail components as deemed warranted. if we decide to not sell or participate in a joint venture and instead hire a third-party manager, we would be dependent on them and their key personnel who provide services to us and we may not find a suitable replacement if the management agreement is terminated, or if key personnel leave or otherwise become unavailable to us. construction projects are subject to risks that materially increase the costs of completion. in the event that we decide to redevelop existing properties, we will be subject to risks and uncertainties associated with construction and development. these risks include, but are not limited to, risks related to obtaining all necessary zoning, land-use, building occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations, risks related to the environmental concerns of government entities or community groups, risks related to changes in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization, risks related to construction labor disruptions, adverse weather, acts of god or shortages of materials and labor which could cause construction delays and risks related to increases in the cost of labor and materials which could cause construction costs to be greater than projected and adversely impact the amount of our development fees or our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties. our existing properties, as well as properties we may acquire, as commercial facilities, are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 (the "ada"). investigation of a property may reveal non-compliance with this act. the requirements of the ada, or of other federal, state or local laws or regulations, also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons. future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties. 9 table of contents we do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. we have invested in some properties as a co-venturer or partner, instead of owning directly. in these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. as a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. these investments involve risks and uncertainties. the co-venturer or partner may fail to provide capital or fulfill its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments. conflicts arising between us and our partners may be difficult to manage and/or resolve and it could be difficult to manage or otherwise monitor the existing business arrangements. the co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt, which may result in significant losses to us. in addition, joint venture arrangements may decrease our ability to manage risk and implicate additional risks, such as: potentially inferior financial capacity, diverging business goals and strategies and the need for our venture partner continued cooperation; our inability to take actions with respect to the joint venture activities that we believe are favorable to us if our joint venture partner does not agree; our inability to control the legal entity that has title to the real estate associated with the joint venture; our lenders may not be easily able to sell our joint venture assets and investments or may view them less favorably as collateral, which could negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources; our joint venture partners can take actions that we may not be able to anticipate or prevent, which could result in negative impacts on our debt and equity; and our joint venture partners business decisions or other actions or omissions may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investments. our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. we may not be able to recover our investments in cost method investments , which may result in significant losses to us. the economic performance and value of our cost method investments, which we do not control and are in retail operations, are subject to risks associated with owning and operating retail businesses, including: changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies; increasing use by customers of e-commerce and online store sites; and ongoing consolidation in the retail sector. a decline in the value of our cost method investments may require us to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment ( otti ) against such assets. when the fair value of an investment is determined to be less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date, we assess whether the decline is temporary or other-than-temporary. if we intend to sell an impaired asset, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired asset before any anticipated recovery, then we must recognize an otti through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the asset amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date. when an otti is recognized through earnings, a new cost basis is established for the asset and the new cost basis may not be adjusted through earnings for subsequent recoveries in fair value. our real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges. we periodically assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate assets and other investments may be impaired. a property value is considered to be impaired only if the estimated aggregate future undiscounted property cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property. in our estimate of cash flows, we consider factors such as trends and prospects and the effects of demand and competition on expected future operating income. if we are evaluating the potential sale of an asset or redevelopment alternatives, the undiscounted future cash flows consider the most likely course of action as of the balance sheet date based on current plans, intended holding periods and available market information. we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate assets and other investments. impairment charges have an immediate direct impact on our earnings. there can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken. 10 table of contents we intend to continue to sell our lesser quality assets and may not be able to recover our investments, which may result in significant losses to us. there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the current carrying amount of all of our lesser quality properties and investments and those of our unconsolidated joint ventures in the future. our failure to do so would require us to recognize impairment charges for the period in which we reached that conclusion, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico and have completely exited chile, brazil, peru and canada, however, we cannot predict the impact of laws and regulations affecting these international operations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions. our international operations have included properties in canada, mexico, chile, brazil and peru and are subject to a variety of united states and foreign laws and regulations, including the united states foreign corrupt practices act and foreign tax laws and regulations. although we have substantially completed our efforts to exit our investments in mexico, south america and canada, we cannot assure you that our past or any current international operations will continue to be found to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. in addition, we cannot predict the manner in which such laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted, or when, or the potential that we may face regulatory sanctions or tax audits as a result of our international operations. we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks which could adversely affect o ur business , cause loss of confidential information and disrupt operations . a cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. more specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information. we may face cyber incidents and security breaches through malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems. the risk of a cybersecurity breach or disruption, particularly through a cyber incident, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform day-to-day operations and, in some cases, may be critical to the operations of certain of our tenants. although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. while we maintain some of our own critical information technology systems, we also depend on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to several key business functions, such as payroll, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. our measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, including password protection, firewalls, backup servers, threat monitoring and periodic penetration testing, may not be successful in preventing a data breach or limiting the effects of a breach. furthermore, the security measures employed by third-party service providers may prove to be ineffective at preventing breaches of their systems. the primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and private data exposure. our financial results may be negatively impacted by such an incident or resulting negative media attention. a cyber incident could: disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our tenants; result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants and/or missed reporting deadlines; result in our inability to properly monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit; result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes; result in our inability to maintain the building systems relied upon by our tenants for the efficient use of their leased space; require significant management attention and resources to remedy and damages that result; subject us to claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements; or damage our reputation among our tenants, investors and associates. moreover, cyber incidents perpetrated against our tenants, including unauthorized access to customers credit card data and other confidential information, could diminish consumer confidence and consumer spending and negatively impact our business. 11 table of contents we may be subject to liability under environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or were responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. natural disasters, severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, snowstorms, floods and fires, and the frequency of these natural disasters and severe weather conditions may increase due to climate change. the occurrence of natural disasters, severe weather conditions and the effects of climate change can delay new development or redevelopment projects, increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties, increase operation costs, including the cost of energy at our properties, increase costs for future property insurance, negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space and cause substantial damages or losses to our properties which could exceed any applicable insurance coverage. the incurrence of any of these losses, costs or business interruptions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. in addition, changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development or redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in revenues, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. pandemics or other health crises may adversely affect our tenants financial condition and the profitability of our properties. our business and the businesses of our tenants could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to a pandemic or other health crisis, such as the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (covid-19). such events could result in the complete or partial closure of one or more of our tenants manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in our tenants supply chains from local and international suppliers, and /or delays in the delivery of our tenants inventory. the profitability of our properties depends, in part, on the willingness of customers to visit our tenants businesses. the risk, or public perception of the risk, of a pandemic or media coverage of infectious diseases could cause employees or customers to avoid our properties, which could adversely affect foot traffic to our tenants businesses and our tenants ability to adequately staff their businesses. such events could adversely impact tenants sales and/or cause the temporary closure of our tenants businesses, which could severely disrupt their operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. corporate responsibility, specifically related to environmental, social and governance factors ( esg ), may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks. the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk information to investors and shareholders have developed scores and ratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon environmental, social and governance ( esg ) or sustainability metrics. many investment funds focus on positive esg business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. in addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved esg disclosure or performance. we may face reputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies. although we have generally scored highly in these metrics to date, there can be no assurance that we will continue to score highly in the future. in addition, the criteria by which companies are rated may change, which could cause us to receive lower scores than previous years. a low sustainability score could result in a negative perception of the company, or exclusion of our common stock from consideration by certain investors who may elect to invest with our competition instead. our success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. we depend on the deep industry knowledge and efforts of key personnel, including our executive officers, to manage our day-to-day operations and strategic business direction. our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel may significantly impact our future performance, and if any of our executive officers or other key personnel depart the company, for any reason, we may not be able to easily replace such individual. the loss of the services of our executive officers and other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. risks related to our debt and equity securities we may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equity markets, which would have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our financial condition and our results of operations. we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the credit and/or equity markets to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain financing on terms favorable to us. the inability to obtain financing on a timely basis could have negative effects on our business, such as: we could have great difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which would materially adversely affect our investment strategy; our liquidity could be adversely affected; we may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; we may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on terms unfavorable to us to fund our indebtedness; or we may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing stakeholders. adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on terms favorable to us, if at all, and could significantly reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities. we are subject to f inancial covenants that may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. our revolving credit facility and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios and limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. in addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under our revolving credit facility and the indentures and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. 12 table of contents impacts from transition away from london inter-bank offered rate ( libor ) . a portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on libor for deposits of u.s. dollars. libor and certain other interest benchmarks may be subject to regulatory guidance and/or reform that could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated consequences. the united kingdom financial conduct authority, which regulates libor, has announced that it intends to stop encouraging or requiring banks to submit libor rates after 2021, and it is unclear if libor will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating libor will evolve. if libor ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating libor change from their current form, interest rates on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: the extent of institutional investor interest in us; the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours; the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities, including securities issued by other real estate companies; our financial condition and performance; the market perception of our growth potential, potential future cash dividends and risk profile; an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and general economic and financial market conditions. we may change the dividend policy for our common stock in the future. the decision to declare and pay dividends on our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount and composition of any such future dividends, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, operating cash flows, liquidity, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual prohibitions or other limitations under our indebtedness including preferred stock, the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code, state law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant or are requirements under the code or state or federal laws. any negative change in our dividend policy could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. our charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent a change of control transaction, even if such a change in control may be in our best interest, and as a result may depress the market price of our securities. our charter contains certain ownership limits. our charter contains various provisions that are intended to preserve our qualification as a reit and, subject to certain exceptions, authorize our directors to take such actions as are necessary or appropriate to preserve our qualification as a reit . for example, our charter prohibits the actual, beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 9.8% in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate outstanding shares of all classes and series of our stock. our board of directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, may exempt a person, prospectively or retroactively, from these ownership limits if certain conditions are satisfied. the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock may: discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests; or result in the transfer of shares acquired in excess of the restrictions to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and, as a result, the forfeiture by the acquirer of the benefits of owning the additional shares. risks related to our status as a reit and related u.s. federal income tax matters loss of our tax status as a reit or changes in u.s. federal income tax laws, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions relating to reits could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. we have elected to be taxed as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the code. we believe that we are organized and operate in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and will allow us to remain qualified as a reit under the code. however, there can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for u.s. federal income tax purposes. qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit. the rules dealing with u.s. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and u.s. department of the treasury. we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us. new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit, the u.s. federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments. in order to qualify as a reit, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the ownership of our stock, the composition of our assets and the sources of our gross income. also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our reit taxable income, excluding net capital gains. furthermore, we own a direct or indirect interest in certain subsidiary reits which elected to be taxed as reits for u.s. federal income tax purposes under the code. provided that each subsidiary reit qualifies as a reit, our interest in such subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests. to qualify as a reit, the subsidiary reit must independently satisfy all of the reit qualification requirements. the failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a reit. 13 table of contents if we lose our reit status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders for each of the years involved because: we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would be subject to the regular u.s. federal corporate income tax; we could possibly be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018 or increased state and local taxes; unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. moreover, the tax cuts and jobs act, enacted on december 22, 2017 (the "2017 tax legislation"), significantly changed the u.s. federal income taxation of u.s. businesses and their owners, including reits and their stockholders. the 2017 tax legislation remains unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the treasury and irs, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. in addition, it remains unclear how these u.s. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses u.s. federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. while some of the changes made by the 2017 tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. we continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax legislation as a whole will have on us. we urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock. our failure to qualify as a reit or new legislation or changes in u.s. federal income tax laws (including interpretations and regulations with respect to the tax cuts and jobs act), and with respect to qualification as a reit or the tax consequences of such qualification, could also impair our ability to expand our business or raise capital and have a materially adverse effect on the value of our securities. to maintain our reit status, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions , and the unavailability of such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, may cause us to curtail our inves tment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock . to qualify as a reit, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our net taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains, and we will be subject to regular corporate income taxes on the amount we distribute that is less than 100% of our net taxable income each year, including capital gains. in addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of our ordinary income, 95% of our capital gain net income and 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. while we have historically satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders, a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property, including, in limited circumstances, its own stock. assuming we continue to satisfy these distribution requirements with cash, we may need to borrow funds to meet the reit distribution requirements and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. these borrowing needs could result from differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for u.s. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of cash reserves or required debt or amortization payments. these sources, however, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market's perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, the market price of our common stock, and our current and potential future earnings. we cannot assure you that we will have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail our investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and per share trading price of our common stock. 14 table of contents the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for u.s. federal income tax purposes. a reit's net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. in general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, unless a sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbors, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends. the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. dividends payable by reits, however, generally are not eligible for these reduced rates. under the 2017 tax legislation, u.s. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (i.e., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31, 2017 and before january 1, 2026. although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-reit corporations that pay dividends treated as qualified dividend income, which could materially and adversely affect the value of the shares of reits, including the per share trading price of our common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short-term interest rates and will, from time-to-time, enter into interest rate
