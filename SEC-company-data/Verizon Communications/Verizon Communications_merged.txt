risk factors 18 risk factors the following discussion of "risk factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. this information should be read in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. the following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. adverse conditions in the u.s. and international economies could impact our results of operations. unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the u.s. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. in difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. in addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. if these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face significant competition that may reduce our profits. we face significant competition in our industry. the rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers and providers of voip services. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. in addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided in some cases specifically targeting verizon wireless customers. our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. if we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers' changing demands. if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. if we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. for example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. 18 table of contents changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our media and telematics businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. for example, we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. a new data protection regulation will go into effect in europe in may 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance. in an order adopted by the fcc in december 2017, the fcc repealed its 2015 title ii order that had nullified its longstanding "light touch" approach to regulating broadband internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. the december 2017 order could be appealed or otherwise challenged. the outcome and timing of any such appeal or challenge remains uncertain. in addition, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" fcc regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. the further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers' operations. cyber attacks against companies, including verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. these attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. cyber attacks may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. while, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. the inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. further, certain of verizon's businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. moreover, our increasing presence in the iot industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. in addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse effect on verizon's results of operation or financial condition. natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. in addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. 19 table of contents verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. as of december 31, 2017 , verizon had approximately $108.2 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as approximately $8.9 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. verizon's debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by an entity acquired in a transaction with vodafone, which would reduce the funds verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; making it more difficult or expensive for verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; reducing verizon's flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; making verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and exposing verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 155,400 employees and approximately 197,000 retirees as of december 31, 2017 eligible to participate in verizon's benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and replacement or modification of the patient protection and affordable care act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. as of december 31, 2017 , approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. while we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. in addition, while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 22 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2017 verizon annual report to shareowners under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - market risk", which is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors 17 risk factors the following discussion of "risk factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. this information should be read in conjunction with "management's discussion

respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. we are unable to predict whether our 17 table of contents business will be affected by any such litigation. we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. as of december 31, 2018 , approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. while we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. in addition, while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations. economic and strategic risks we face significant competition that may reduce our profits. we face significant competition in our industries. the rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers and providers of voip services. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. a projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and cause us to record goodwill impairment charges in the future. for example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recognized a $4.6 billion ($4.5 billion after-tax) goodwill impairment charge on our media reporting unit. the amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. in addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided in some cases specifically targeting verizon wireless customers. our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. if we are not able to adapt to changes and disruptions in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers' changing demands. if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. in addition to introducing new offerings and technologies, such as 5g technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. if we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. adverse conditions in the u.s. and international economies could impact our results of operations. unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the u.s. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. in difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. in addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. if these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 18 table of contents legal and regulatory risks changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below, could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our media and telematics businesses, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. privacy and data protection - we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. a new data protection regulation, which went into effect in europe in may 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. a new privacy law scheduled to take effect in california in 2020, also could have a significant impact on certain of our businesses. regulation of broadband internet access services - in its 2015 title ii order, the fcc nullified its longstanding "light touch" approach to regulating broadband internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. the fcc repealed the 2015 title ii order in december 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. the 2017 order has been appealed to the d.c. circuit; the outcome and timing of this appeal or any other challenge remains uncertain. several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the fcc's 2015 rules). the enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. "open access" - we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" fcc regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. the further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. financial risks verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. as of december 31, 2018 , verizon had approximately $103.0 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, as well as approximately $9.4 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. verizon's debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt, which would reduce the funds verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital,

and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 144,500 employees and approximately 195,000 retirees as of december 31, 2018 eligible to participate in verizon's benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the patient protection and affordable care act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2018 verizon annual report to shareholders under the heading "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - market risk," which is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors 15 risk factors the following discussion of "risk factors" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. this information should be read in conjunction with "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. the following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. operational risks cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers' operations. cyber attacks against companies, including verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. they may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. the development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. while, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. the inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. further, certain of verizon's businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. our presence in the iot industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. in addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on verizon's results of operation or financial condition. natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and natural disasters, including an increasing prevalence of wildfires and intensified storm activities. such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. we are implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future, but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits. we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. for example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend. these suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the coronavirus. if such failures occur, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. we are unable to predict whether our 15 table of contents business will be affected by any such litigation. we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. as of december 31, 2019 , approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. while we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. in addition, while a small percentage of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations. economic and strategic risks we face significant competition that may reduce our profits. we face significant competition in our industries. the rapid development of new technologies, services and products have eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers and application and device providers. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. if we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. a projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and has caused us in the past, and may cause us in the future, to record goodwill impairment charges. the amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. in addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided in some cases specifically targeting our customers. our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. if we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers' changing demands. if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. the deployment of our 5g network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory permitting requirements that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. these issues could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks. if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. in addition to introducing new offerings and technologies, such as 5g technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. if we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. adverse conditions in the u.s. and international economies could impact our results of operations. unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the u.s. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. in difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. in addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. if these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 16 table of contents regulatory and legal risks changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below, or new laws or regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change, could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our media business, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. privacy and data protection - we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. europe's general data protection regulation, which went into effect in may 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. in addition, a new privacy law took effect in california at the beginning of 2020, an additional privacy law is scheduled to take effect in maine in 2020, and other states are considering additional regulations. these regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. regulation of broadband internet access services - in its 2015 title ii order, the fcc nullified its longstanding "light touch" approach to regulating broadband internet access services and "reclassified" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. the fcc repealed the 2015 title ii order in december 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. the 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the d.c. circuit, but further appeals and challenges are possible; the outcome and timing of these or any other challenge remains uncertain. several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the fcc's 2015 rules). the enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain. "open access" - we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called "open access" fcc regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. the further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. financial risks verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. as of december 31, 2019 , verizon had approximately $99.1 billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $9.4 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing revolving credit facility and $12.4 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. verizon's debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt, which would reduce the funds verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions; making it more difficult or expensive for verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; reducing verizon's flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industries and market conditions; making verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and 17 table of contents exposing verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. adverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. in addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 135,000 employees and approximately 191,000 retirees as of december 31, 2019 eligible to participate in verizon's benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the patient protection and affordable care act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 19 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2019 verizon

the rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional lines between local, long distance, wireless, cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, electric utilities, and providers of voip services. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. our ability to compete successfully will depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new services that may be introduced by our competitors, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends and pricing pressures. because many of our competitors are subject to less regulation and have lower cost structures than us, due in part to the absence of a unionized work force and fewer retirees, they may be able to offer services at lower prices. the resulting pressure on the price of services provided by us may result in reduced revenues and reduction of profits. unless we effectively keep pace with technological developments in the telecommunications industry we may experience a decline in demand for our services our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. in general, the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. changes in the regulatory regime under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations our operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. unless we are able to obtain relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. in addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could adversely affect our business plans. for example, the development of new technologies, such as internet protocol-based services, including voip and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 20 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the

will depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new services that may be introduced by our competitors, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends and pricing pressures. we are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of our competitors, due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business. accordingly, our competitors may be able to offer services at lower prices. the resulting pressure on the price of services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits. in addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs. if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy. our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers

fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. while we believe our primary wireless technology platform, cdma, and its upgrades offer many advantages, many competing wireless service providers have chosen gsm or other technologies as the technology platforms for their wireless networks. in addition, in november 2007, we announced that we intend to develop and deploy our fourth generation mobile broadband network using long term evolution (lte). this new technology is designed to enable mobile data networks with higher speeds and improved efficiencies. however, there are risks that current or future versions of the wireless technologies and evolutionary path that we have selected may not be demanded by existing and prospective customers or provide the advantages that we expect. in addition, there are risks that other wireless carriers on whom our customers roam may change their technology to other technologies that are incompatible with ours. as a result, the ability of our and such other carriers customers to roam on our respective wireless networks could be adversely affected. if these risks materialize, our ability to provide national wireless service to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected. we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we also depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business. if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to implement our business strategy and, in addition, we might be unable to satisfy the requirements contained in our fcc licenses regarding the construction of our wireless network. these suppliers and vendors may be subject to litigation with respect to technology that we depend on for our service offerings. changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services, or the reviews

local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. in addition, the rapid growth of the wireless industry has led to an increase in efforts by some state legislatures and state public utility commissions to regulate the industry in ways that may impose additional costs on verizon wireless. moreover, many states have also imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry. 13 table of contents natural or man-made disasters may disrupt our operations. the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters may disrupt our operations. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 16 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2007 verizon annual report to shareowners under the heading market risk on page 31, which is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors 14 risk factors the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. adverse conditions in the u.s. and international economies could impact our results of operations. unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the u.s. or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. in difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining products and services under lower-cost programs offered by other companies. similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the u.s. and abroad may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. in addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. if these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits. we face significant competition in our industry. the rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local, long distance, wireless, cable and internet communication services

our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs. accordingly, our competitors may be able to profitably offer services at lower prices. the resulting pressure on the price of services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits. if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy. our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. in general, the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. for example, we have selected long term evolution technology ( lte ) as our next-generation wireless network access technology. we expect this new technology to enable us to offer a mobile data network with higher speeds and improved efficiencies. other wireless service providers have announced their plans to adopt lte as their next-generation technology, and we believe that it will become the principal next-generation global standard. there are risks, however, that these other wireless service providers may delay their deployment of lte or change their selection and adopt different next-generation technologies, including technologies that are incompatible with ours. as a result, lte may not become the principal next-generation global standard and may not provide us with the global scale, compatibility and other benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all. in addition, our ability to successfully deploy lte on our network in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control. these include the risk that the technical standards required for the successful development and deployment of lte may not be established in a timely manner and the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver lte devices and network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications. furthermore, our deployment of lte may not occur, or occur at the cost we have estimated. if these risks materialize, our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected. 14 table of contents we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business. if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide services to our customers in a competitive manner or continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas, require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are frequently involved in regulatory proceedings related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal, and there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business, results of operations and financial condition. the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework could also adversely affect our business plans. for example, the development of new technologies, such as internet protocol-based services, including voip and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. in addition, the fcc has several proceedings pending that are considering the imposition of additional requirements on wireless services, such as rules restricting the ways in which we can manage the use of our network. these rules, if adopted, could impose additional costs on us and potentially impede our ability to operate our wireless network in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. the fcc has also initiated a number of proceedings to evaluate its rules and policies regarding spectrum licensing and usage that could adversely impact our utilization of our licensed spectrum and our operational costs. at the state level, the rapid growth of the wireless industry has led to an increase in efforts by some state legislatures and state public utility commissions to regulate the industry in ways that may impose additional costs on our wireless business. moreover, many states have also imposed significant taxes on providers in the wireless industry. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 223,900 employees and approximately 213,000 retirees who participate in our benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in costs associated with our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. natural or man-made disasters could have an adverse effect on our business. natural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. the recent disruption in the global financial markets has also impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business. a sustained decline in the stability of financial institutions could affect our access to financing. 15 table of contents we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. if we are not able to successfully integrate alltel into our business, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of this acquisition. we expect to gain certain benefits from the alltel acquisition, including increased revenues, market penetration in alltel service areas, expansion of our network footprint and certain operating efficiencies and synergies. achievement of these expected benefits will depend on our efforts to integrate alltel into our business. the challenges we may face in connection with these integration efforts include developing and deploying next generation wireless technology across the combined network and combining product and service offerings, customer plans and sales and marketing approaches. if we do not successfully integrate alltel in a cost effective manner, we may not realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our financial results may be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 18 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2008 verizon annual report to shareowners under the heading market risk on page 28, which is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors 17 risk factors the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. adverse conditions in the u.s. and international economies could impact our results of operations. unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the u.s. or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. in difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining products and services under lower-cost programs offered by other companies. similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the u.s. and abroad may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. in addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. if these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits. we face significant competition in our industry. the rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between local, long distance, wireless, cable and internet communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities, and providers of voip services. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our services and equipment, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends and economic conditions. we are subject to more regulation and have higher cost structures than many of our competitors, due in part to the presence of a unionized workforce and a large retiree population in our wireline business. in addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact of such labor organizing on our costs. accordingly, our competitors may be able to profitably offer services at lower prices. the resulting pressure on the price of services we provide may result in reduced revenues and profits. if we are not able to take advantage of technological developments in the telecommunications industry on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in a demand for our services or may be unable to implement our business strategy. our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, to enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. in general, the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. if these services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. for example, we have selected long term evolution technology ( lte ) as our next-generation wireless network access technology. we expect this new technology to enable us to offer a mobile data network with higher speeds and improved efficiencies. other wireless service providers have announced their plans to adopt lte as their next-generation technology, and we believe that it will become the principal next-generation global standard. there are risks, however, that these other wireless service providers may delay their deployment of lte or change their selection and adopt different next-generation technologies, including technologies that are incompatible with ours. as a result, lte may not become the principal next-generation global standard and may not provide us with the global scale, compatibility and other benefits that we expect in a timely manner or at all. in addition, our ability to deploy lte on our network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control, including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver lte devices and network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications. furthermore, our deployment of lte may not occur, or occur at the cost we have estimated. if these risks materialize, our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected. we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we depend upon various key suppliers and vendors to provide us with the equipment that we need to operate our business. if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service to us on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide services to our customers in a competitive manner or continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 17 table of contents the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas, require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are frequently involved in regulatory proceedings related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our provision of retail or wholesale services, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business, results of operations and financial condition. the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans. new regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. for example, the development of new technologies, such as internet protocol-based services, including voip and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. in addition, the fcc has several proceedings pending that are considering the imposition of additional requirements on wireline and wireless services. for instance, on october 22, 2009, the fcc initiated a proceeding in which it proposes to adopt so-called net neutrality rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the internet. the proposed rules would limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider could manage its network and the services it could provide over the network. these restrictions would include limitations related to devices that could connect to the network, services and applications provided over the network and priority of traffic moving over the network. the proposed rules would apply to all providers of broadband internet access services, whether wireline or wireless, but would not apply to providers of applications, content or other services, including many companies with which we compete in the marketplace. if final rules are adopted that limit our flexibility in managing our broadband networks and delivering broadband services, these rules could have a significant adverse effect on our broadband business, restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 222,900 employees and approximately 213,000 retirees participating in verizon benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in costs associated with our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. the federal government has been considering various proposals for legislation to reform the u.s. healthcare system. there are also various healthcare reform proposals being considered at the state level. while we cannot predict with certainty which healthcare reform initiatives, if any, will be implemented at the federal or state level, such regulation may have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, or our funding commitments. natural or man-made disasters could have an adverse effect on our business. natural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets similar to those of recent years could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could affect our access to financing. 18 table of contents we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. if we are not able to successfully integrate alltel into our business, we may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of this acquisition. we have realized certain benefits from the alltel acquisition, including increased revenues, market penetration in alltel service areas, expansion of our network footprint and certain operating efficiencies and synergies. as we continue our integration efforts, we may face challenges, such as the combination and simplification of product and service offerings, customer plans and sales and marketing approaches, and the development and deployment of next generation wireless technology across the combined network. if we do not successfully meet these various challenges and continue to integrate alltel in a timely and cost effective manner, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and our financial results may be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2009 verizon

wireless services to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected. 17 table of contents we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. for example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on

of operations and financial condition. the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans. new regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. for example, the development of new technologies, such as ip-based services, including voip and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. as the holder of 700 mhz c block licenses, we are required to comply with certain open access regulations that the fcc has imposed on all licensees of 700 mhz c block spectrum. these rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the lte network we are deploying on that spectrum, including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers, subject to certain technical limitations established by us. the fcc has not yet finally determined what level of access will satisfy the open access requirements. once finally determined, these requirements may increase the costs or limit the revenue-generating potential associated with our use of the c block. in addition, on december 21, 2010, the fcc adopted an order in which it imposed so-called net neutrality rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the internet. these new rules limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network. given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in this order are not fully defined and given that the order creates procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations of the order, it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities, which could lead to yet further regulation. the regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks. natural disasters, terrorist attacks or breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. natural disasters, terrorist acts, acts of war, cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (it) security may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. in addition, a failure to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security could result in damage to our reputation. any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 18 table of contents adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 194,400 employees and approximately 215,400 retirees as of december 31, 2010 participating in verizon benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010, the enactment of any similar health care reform measures at the state level, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts or additional organizing activity. as of december 31, 2010, approximately 30% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. labor contracts covering many of our employees will expire in 2011. accordingly, in 2011, we will be engaged in negotiations with our labor unions regarding new contracts. depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers, and we cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage. in addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. quantitative and qualitative

to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. in general, the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to the varied and continually changing demands of our customers. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints to our introduction of new services. if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. for example, we have selected long term evolution technology (lte) as our next-generation wireless network access technology. our ability to continue to deploy our 4g lte network successfully and in a timely manner depends on various factors that are beyond our control, including the risk that our suppliers may be unable to manufacture and deliver 4g lte network equipment on schedule and according to our specifications. furthermore, our deployment of 4g lte may not occur at the cost we have estimated. if these risks materialize, our ability to provide next generation wireless services to our customers, to retain and attract customers, and to maintain and grow our customer revenues could be materially adversely affected. in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. if we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. 15 table of contents we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment, handsets and other devices and equipment, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. for example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict our ability to operate in or provide specified products or services in designated areas and require that we maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are frequently involved in regulatory and non-regulatory governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. unless we are able to obtain appropriate relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful at obtaining the licenses we need to carry out our business strategy or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years that are subject to renewal. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our wireless business, results of operations and financial condition. the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal or state level could also adversely affect our business plans. new regulations could restrict the ways in which we can manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. for example, the development of new technologies, such as ip-based services, including voip and super high-speed broadband and video, could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services based on this technology. as the holder of 700 mhz c block licenses, we are required to comply with certain open access regulations that the fcc has imposed on all licensees of 700 mhz c block spectrum. these rules require us to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice on the lte network we are deploying on that spectrum, including those obtained from sources other than us or our distributors or dealers, subject to certain technical limitations established by us. in addition, on december 21, 2010, the fcc adopted an order in which it imposed so-called net neutrality rules that it describes as intended to preserve the openness of the internet. these new rules, which took effect in november 2011 and are subject to a pending appeal, will limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can manage its network and the services it can provide over the network. given that the scope of the restrictions and many critical terms in the open access and net neutrality rules are not fully defined and given that the rules create procedural mechanisms for parties to complain of violations, it is reasonable to expect litigation to resolve ambiguities, which could lead to yet further regulation. the regulation of broadband activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our broadband networks. 16 table of contents breaches of network or information technology security, natural disasters or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (it) security, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war may cause equipment failures or disrupt our operations. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. in particular, both unsuccessful and successful cyber attacks on companies have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation and damage to our reputation. further, certain of verizon businesses, including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. in addition, if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about the company and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 193,900 employees and approximately 209,400 retirees as of december 31, 2011 participating in verizon benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts or additional organizing activity. as of december 31, 2011, approximately 30% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. labor contracts covering many of our union employees expired on august 6, 2011, at which time verizon experienced a 14-day work stoppage. the company and the unions then entered into a return to work agreement pursuant to which the employees returned to work under the terms and conditions of the previous contracts indefinitely; however, either the company or the unions may terminate the contract extensions after providing seven (7) days notice. we continue to be engaged in negotiations with our unions regarding new contracts. depending on the course of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience additional work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including through a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. in addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. 17 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 20 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2011 verizon annual report to shareowners under the heading market risk on page 44, which is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors 15 risk factors the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. the following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. adverse conditions in the u.s. and international economies could impact our results of operations. unfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or in one or more of our other major markets, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. in difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. similarly, under these conditions the business customers that we serve in the united states and abroad may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. in addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. if these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face significant competition that may reduce our market share and lower our profits. we face significant competition in our industry. the rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated the traditional distinctions between wireless, cable, internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities, and providers of voip services. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of services, they have also allowed other service providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our services and equipment, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. if we are not able to successfully respond to these competitive challenges, we could lose market share and experience reduced profits. if we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may

information technology (it) security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. in addition, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. cyber attacks, which include the use of malware, computer viruses and other means for disruption or unauthorized access, on companies, including verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. while, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber attack in the future. the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures, lost revenues from business interruption, litigation and damage to our reputation. further, certain of verizon businesses, including the provisioning of security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks is called into question as a

to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 16 table of contents natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. in addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase

with approximately 183,400 employees and approximately 205,600 retirees as of december 31, 2012 participating in verizon benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. as of december 31, 2012, approximately 29% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. we are currently engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 4,800 wireline employees, and we will engage in additional negotiations as other labor contracts expire in the future. depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including causing a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. 17 table of

which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services. we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. for example, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. as another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called open access fcc regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. in addition, our broadband internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose so-called network neutrality rules, some of which were affirmed and others vacated on appeal in early 2014. proponents of these rules want to limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network. the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology (it) security may cause equipment failures or disruptions to our operations. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant

theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about verizon and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against breaches of network or it security, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. in addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. verizon debt has increased significantly and could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. as of december 31, 2013, verizon had approximately $93.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $6.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. since that date, verizon has incurred $20.3 billion of additional indebtedness and became entitled to draw upon an additional $2 billion of borrowing capacity under a 364-day revolving credit agreement. verizon debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by the entity acquired from vodafone, which would reduce the funds verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; 16 table of contents making it more difficult or expensive for verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; reducing verizon flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; making verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and exposing verizon to increased interest rate risk given that a portion of its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. in addition, the term loan agreement verizon entered into in connection with the wireless transaction requires verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless verizon credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit verizon ability to obtain additional financing in the future. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 176,800 employees and approximately 209,000 retirees as of december 31, 2013 eligible to participate in verizon benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. as of december 31, 2013, approximately 28% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. we are currently engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 2,900 employees of our wireline business, and we will engage in additional negotiations as other labor contracts expire in the future. depending on the outcome of these negotiations, we could incur additional costs and/or experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including causing a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. our business faces a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. sales of shares of verizon common stock after the completion of the wireless transaction may cause the market price of verizon common stock to fall. as of december 31, 2013, verizon had approximately 2.86 billion shares of common stock outstanding. verizon issued approximately 1.27 billion shares of verizon common stock in connection with the wireless transaction. the issuance of these new shares of verizon common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for verizon common stock. in addition, many vodafone shareholders are already shareholders of verizon and those shareholders may decide not to hold the additional verizon shares they received in the wireless transaction. other vodafone shareholders, such as funds with geographic limitations on their permitted investments, may be required to sell the shares of verizon common stock that they received in the wireless transaction. such sales of verizon common stock could also have the effect of depressing the market price for verizon common stock. 17 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 20 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information required by this item is included in the 2013 verizon annual report to shareowners under the heading market risk on page 29, which is incorporated herein by reference.risk factors 17 risk factors the following discussion of risk factors identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition or future performance. this information should be read in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. the following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements. adverse conditions in the u.s. and international economies could impact our results of operations. unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the united states or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. in difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. in addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. if these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. we face significant competition that may reduce our profits. we face significant competition in our industry. the rapid development of new technologies, services and products has eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, internet, local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers, application and device providers, electric utilities and providers of voip services. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. if we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits. if we are not able to adapt to changes in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits. our industry is experiencing rapid change as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs. in order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers changing demands. if we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. we may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our introduction of new services. if our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. in addition to introducing new technologies and offerings, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. if we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. in addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services. we depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business. we depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as switch and network equipment and handsets, that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. for example, our handset and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices. if these suppliers or vendors fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectations, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers. we also may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. because of the costs and time lags that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. the suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. such claims have been growing rapidly in the communications industry. we are unable to predict whether our business will be affected by any such litigation. we expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology. 17 table of contents changes in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations. our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the fcc and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. these regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and to provide specified products or services. we are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. we are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings related to the application of these requirements. it is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. for example, the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. the loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. new laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities, and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. for example, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. as another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called open access fcc regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. in addition, our broadband internet access services are subject to various attempts to impose so-called network neutrality rules, some of which were affirmed and others vacated on appeal by the u.s. district court for the district of columbia in early 2014. proponents of these rules want to limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can structure business arrangements and manage its network. some of these parties have urged the fcc to reclassify broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service under title ii of the communications act, thus subjecting these services to traditional utility-style regulation. the fcc has an open proceeding concerning whether and what new regulation to adopt, and on what legal basis. the further regulation of broadband, wireless, and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks. cyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers operations. cyber attacks against companies, including verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. further, the perpetrators of cyber attacks are not restricted to particular groups or persons. these attacks may be committed by company employees or external actors operating in any geography, including jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are unavailable or ineffective, and may even be launched by or at the behest of nation states. while, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. our inability to operate our wireline or wireless networks as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/or loss of market share to other communications providers. the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cyber security measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. further, certain of verizon businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. in addition, if we fail to prevent the theft of valuable information such as financial data, sensitive information about verizon and intellectual property, or if we fail to protect the privacy of customer and employee confidential data against cyber attacks, it could result in damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact customer and investor confidence. any of these occurrences could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. a natural disaster or other event causing significant physical damage could cause us to experience substantial losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. in addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. 18 table of contents verizon debt has increased significantly and could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. as of december 31, 2014, verizon had approximately $113.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $7.9 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. verizon debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by the entity acquired from vodafone, which would reduce the funds verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; making it more difficult or expensive for verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; reducing verizon flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; making verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and exposing verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. in addition, the term loan agreement verizon entered into in connection with the wireless transaction requires verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless verizon credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit verizon ability to obtain additional financing in the future. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 177,300 employees and approximately 209,000 retirees as of december 31, 2014 eligible to participate in verizon benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the continuing implementation of the provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of 2010, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. as of december 31, 2014, approximately 27% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. in 2015, we will be engaged in contract negotiations with labor unions representing approximately 39,000 employees of our wireline business. during the course of these negotiations we could experience lengthy work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations, including a loss of revenue and strained relationships with customers. we cannot predict the length of any such work stoppage. depending on the outcome of the negotiations, we may incur additional costs. in addition, while the workforce of our wireless business is almost entirely non-union, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. 19 table of contents quantitative and

device providers and providers of voip services. while these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. in addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided in some cases specifically targeting verizon wireless customers. our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. it will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industry, including new

state and local, or international level could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. for example, we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. a new data protection regulation will go into effect in europe in may 2018 that includes significant penalties for non-compliance. in addition, in its order imposing so-called network neutrality regulations, the fcc reversed course in 2015 on the longstanding light touch approach and reclassified broadband internet access services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. while the full scope and effect of this new regulatory approach is uncertain, these rules limit the ways that a broadband internet access service provider can structure business arrangements, manage its network and open the door to additional restrictions, including rate regulation that could adversely affect broadband investment and innovation. these rules may be subject to further challenge in the courts and the proper scope of such regulations is being debated in congress and the fcc, but the outcome and timing of those challenges and debates remain uncertain. as another example, we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called open access fcc regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the fcc and/or various state and local authorities, which could

providers. the costs associated with a major cyber attack on verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. the potential costs associated with these attacks could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. further, certain of verizon businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. moreover, our increasing presence in the iot industry with offerings of telematics products and services, including vehicle telematics, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. in addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings. any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence, and could further result in a material adverse effect on verizon results of operation or financial condition. natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations. our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and events beyond our control. such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers. while we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with these events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery 19 table of contents planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. these events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and

losses resulting in significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. in addition, these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption as well as damage to our reputation. verizon has significant debt, which could increase further if verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt. as of december 31, 2016, verizon had approximately $108.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as approximately $8.9 billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing credit facility. verizon debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including: requiring verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt and the preferred stock issued by an entity acquired in a transaction with vodafone, which would reduce the funds verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions; making it more difficult or expensive for verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes; reducing verizon flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industry and market conditions; making verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and exposing verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates. in addition, our term loan agreements require verizon to maintain a certain leverage ratio unless verizon credit ratings are at or above a certain level, which could limit verizon ability to obtain additional financing in the future. adverse changes in the credit markets could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing. we require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. we fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. a decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. a severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing. increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. with approximately 160,900 employees and approximately 201,000 retirees as of december 31, 2016 eligible to participate in verizon benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential repeal and replacement or modification of the patient protection and affordable care act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. if we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments. a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts. as of december 31, 2016, approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. while less than 1% of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline are represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in organizing these workforces or the potentially negative impact it would have on our costs. we are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements. we are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. in addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and consumer class action lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters, and class action lawsuits that challenge marketing practices and disclosures relating to alleged adverse health effects of handheld wireless phones. we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. in addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements. 20 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 22 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
