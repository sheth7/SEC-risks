risk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company's products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. 16 seasonal fluctuations in our operating results result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , approximately 29 percent , 34 percent and 43 percent , respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. if we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete, including the thermal imaging industry, are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. we must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we now design, manufacture and market numerous product lines across our segments in numerous locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we manufacture our products at various facilities. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2011 , 2010 and 2009 , international sales accounted for 48 percent , 47 percent and 41 percent , respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; 17 labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. operating margins may be negatively impacted by a downturn in sales our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. in addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. as a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made thirteen acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. our most recent acquisitions include aerius photonics, llc in 2011, raymarine holdings limited ( raymarine ) and icx technologies, inc. ( icx ) in 2010 and salvador imaging, inc., omnitech partners, inc. and directed perception, inc. in 2009. raymarine and icx are among the largest acquisitions we have completed and the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18 we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2011 , our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $662.8 million and represented 31 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. in the aftermath of 9/11, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 19 we rely on information systems, electronic communication systems, internal and external data and application software in our operations. systems failures, security breaches and other disruptions, whether internal or external, could have an adverse affect on our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware, software and communication systems. even the most well protected information systems are vulnerable to systems failures. such failures could be caused by internal or external events such as incursions by intruders or hackers, computer viruses, power outages or cyber terrorists. we are particularly mindful of these risks because we believe the technologies we have developed or acquired are attractive to third parties. the unavailability of the information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous effects, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and increased overhead costs and the loss or compromise of important information or data, causing our reputation, business and results of operations to be adversely affected. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms. we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. 20 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates under the credit agreements impacts the interest that we incur and our cash flows. at december 31, 2011 , no amounts were outstanding under our credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-u.s. operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company's products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. in 2012, our performance was negatively impacted by reduced spending by the united states and middle east government agencies and the eurozone crisis. continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , approximately 27 percent , 29 percent and 34 percent , respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. as a result of passage of the budget control act of 2011, substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the united states government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. reductions in military spending, known as the "sequester," could adversely affect our results from operations. the continued use of continuing resolutions by the united states government, which limit spending flexibility and levels by united states government agencies, may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. if we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. 18 our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete, including the thermal imaging and cbrne industries, are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. we must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we now design, manufacture and market numerous product lines across our segments in numerous locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we manufacture our products at various facilities. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , international sales accounted for 49 percent , 48 percent and 47 percent , respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. operating margins may be negatively impacted by a downturn in sales our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. 19 competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made thirteen acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. our most recent acquisitions include lorex and traficon in 2012, aerius photonics, llc in 2011, and raymarine holdings limited ( raymarine ) and icx technologies, inc. ( icx ) in 2010. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2012 , our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $643.7 million and represented 30 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. 20 our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. in the aftermath of 9/11, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on information systems, electronic communication systems, internal and external data and application software in our operations. systems failures, security breaches, and other disruptions, whether internal or external, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware, software, and communication systems. even the most well protected information systems are vulnerable to systems failures. such failures could be caused by internal or external events such as incursions by intruders or hackers, computer viruses, power outages or cyber terrorists. we are particularly mindful of these risks because we believe the technologies we have developed or acquired are attractive to third parties. the unavailability of the information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason, or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous effects, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, increased overhead costs, and the loss or compromise of important information or data, causing our reputation, business, and results of operations to be adversely affected. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. 21 we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates under the credit agreements impacts the interest that we incur and our cash flows. at december 31, 2012 , no amounts were outstanding under our credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-u.s. operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company's products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. in recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by united states government agencies, global economic weakness, and the eurozone crisis. continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results result from: the seasonal p attern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of com mercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , approximately 24 percent , 27 percent and 29 percent , respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the united states government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. if we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. 17 our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. we must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , international sales accounted for 50 percent , 49 percent and 48 percent , respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the impositi on of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; failure to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and econ omic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins. 18 competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made thirteen acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2013 , our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $729.9 million and represented 31 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. 19 our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold world-wide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. in the aftermath of 9/11, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on information systems, electronic communication systems, internal and external data and application software in our operations. systems failures, security breaches, and other disruptions, whether internal or external, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware, software, and communication systems. even the most well protected information systems are vulnerable to systems failures. such failures could be caused by internal or external events such as incursions by intruders or hackers, computer viruses, power outages or cyber terrorists. we are particularly mindful of these risks because we believe the technologies we have developed or acquired are attractive to third parties. the unavailability of the information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason, or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous effects, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, increased overhead costs, and the loss or compromise of important information or data, causing our reputation, business, and results of operations to be adversely affected. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. 20 we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and borrowings against our $150 million term loan, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-u.s. operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause

our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $686.5 million and represented approximately 29 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for impairment annually or more

future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 , international sales accounted for 50 percent, 50 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; failure to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future

the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may

cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions in the regular course of business as a united states government contractor, we face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers' proprietary or classified information, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events and failures of our technology tools and systems. in addition, we are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality. our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. we are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own. in particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly. such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years. further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. these technologies are subject to failure and the user's inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies. accordingly, we have invested in highly skilled information technology resources to appropriately identify and deter threats and monitor and mitigate potential risks. we maintain information security policies and procedures for managing all systems. however, while we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. nonetheless, in the future, 22 these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems. they also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, some of our proprietary software and products use or contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers. these risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our corporate structure and organization our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we must successfully manage a complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made thirteen acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and borrowings against our term loan, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which 23 are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-united states operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our business we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , approximately 20 percent, 20 percent and 24 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the united states government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. in addition, violations of unrelated laws and statutes can lead to debarment and other penalties. if we fail to comply with procurement rules and regulations and other laws and statutes, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. an adverse action by the united states government could also result in lost sales to non-governmental customers who might disqualify us as a result of such adverse action. operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2015 , our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $737.6 million and represented approximately 31 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for 20 impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , international sales accounted for 47 percent, 49 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products; restrictions and prohibitions on the export of technology and products; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, compliance with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. in certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations. in addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency 21 exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers export and other licenses are required from united states government agencies under the itar, the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917, and the arms export control act of 1976 and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. the aftermath of 9/11, the rise of terrorism and the changing geopolitical environment, and heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time), has led to heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets and has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications, including in countries where we have historically made significant sales. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company's products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. in recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by united states government agencies, global economic weakness, and the eurozone crisis. continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. 22 no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our technology and intellectual property our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. 23 our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions we face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers' proprietary or classified information, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. we are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality. our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. we are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own. in particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to

technologies and may contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers. these risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation. while we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. we require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. we use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts. these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. these security systems cannot provide absolute security. to the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems. moreover, if a security breach of our information technology system affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability. although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. nonetheless, in the future, these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems. they also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our corporate structure and organization our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we must successfully manage a complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to 24 effectively manage the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made ten acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and borrowings against our term loan, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all. our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations. our ability to refinance indebtedness, including the notes which we expect to refinance in 2016, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. in addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. a refinancing of our indebtedness, including the notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including belgium, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, including in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. for example, in january 2016, the european 25 commission announced a decision concluding that certain rules under belgian tax legislation are deemed to be incompatible with european union regulations on state aid. as a result of this decision, the european commission has directed the belgian government to recover past taxes from certain entities, which we expect to include one of our belgian subsidiaries regarding the amount of taxes applicable to us during a three year period ending in july 2015. negotiations are ongoing between the belgian government and the european commission to agree on a methodology to calculate the applicable amounts for each company impacted by the decision. furthermore, the decision may be appealed before the general court of the european union by the belgian government and by companies which are directly affected by the decision. although no demand for payment or other official notice has been received by us to date, we are currently reviewing the matter, including the potential impact to the 2016 tax provision, and expect to take actions necessary to preserve our rights, including reducing or eliminating the amount determined to be state aid. we expect that the ultimate amount owed, if any, will be determined after litigation and/or negotiation and such amount could be material. our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-united states operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our business we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , approximately 25 percent, 21 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the united states government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. in addition, violations of unrelated laws and statutes can lead to debarment and other penalties. if we fail to comply with procurement rules and regulations and other laws and statutes, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. an adverse action by the united states government could also result in lost sales to non-governmental customers who might disqualify us as a result of such adverse action. operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2016 , our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $969.9 million and represented approximately 37 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill and 20 indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 , international sales accounted for 46 percent, 47 percent and 49 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. certain of these products, particularly our thermal and infrared products, are subject to substantial government regulation and licensing and end use restrictions throughout the world. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products; restrictions and prohibitions on the export of technology and products, including recent changes in regulation prohibiting the sale of certain of our products to certain end users without a license; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. some of these factors recently have had an adverse impact on our sales and operations and increased the company's cost of doing business and subjected the business to additional rules, policies and procedures that impacted the operation of the company. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, compliance with complex foreign and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business both in the united states and in international jurisdictions. these regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. for example, on april 8, 2015, the company and the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) entered into an agreement through entry of an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to section 21c of the securities and exchange act of 1934, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order (the sec order ). the sec order settled charges under the fcpa with respect to incidents of improper travel and gifts involving flir's middle east operation. pursuant to the sec order, the company is obligated to cease and desist from committing any future violations of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. in certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations. in addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. the impact 21 of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers export and other licenses are required from united states government agencies under the itar, the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917, and the arms export control act of 1976 and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products. thermal and infrared products identified in category xii of the united states munitions list like those manufactured by the company have recently been the subject of export control reform moving classification and control of some products from the itar to the ccl and adding additional license requirements and restrictions under regulations administered by the united states department of commerce. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses from the united states department of state or department of commerce necessary to conduct our business as presently or historically conducted. the aftermath of 9/11, the rise of terrorism and the changing geopolitical environment, and heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time), and the company's 2014 submission to the united states department of state office of defense trade controls compliance ( ddtc ), pursuant to international traffic in arms regulation ( itar ) 127.12(c), regarding the unauthorized export of technical data and defense services to dual and third country nationals in at least four facilities of the company, have led to heightened scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets and has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications, including in countries where we have historically made significant sales. failures to obtain or delays in obtaining licenses prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. see also item 3 "legal proceedings" for additional information regarding the company's 2014 submission to ddtc. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company's products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. in recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by united states government agencies, global economic weakness, and the eurozone crisis. continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter; 22 the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our technology and intellectual property our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party 23 could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions we face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers' proprietary or classified information, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. we are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality. our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. we are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own. in particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly. such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years. further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. these technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user's inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and may contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers. these risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation. while we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. we require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. we use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts. these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. these security systems cannot provide absolute security. to the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems. moreover, if a security breach of our information technology system affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability. although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. nonetheless, in the future, these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems. they also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 24 risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our corporate structure and organization our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. on february 14, 2017, we announced that andrew c. teich, our president, chief executive officer, and a member of our board of directors, plans to retire. mr. teich will continue to serve in his current roles until his successor is appointed. failure to attract, integrate and retain a qualified successor could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we also cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we must successfully manage a complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made twelve acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and borrowings against our unsecured credit facility, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event 25 of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all. our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations. our ability to refinance indebtedness, including the notes, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. in addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. a refinancing of our indebtedness, including the notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including belgium, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, including in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. for example, in january 2016, the european commission announced a decision concluding that certain rules under belgian tax legislation are deemed to be incompatible with european union regulations on state aid. as a result of this decision, the european commission has directed the belgian government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of the company's international subsidiaries. the belgian government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the general count of the european union, and in july 2016 the company filed a separate appeal with the general court of the european union. the company recorded discrete tax expense of $39.6 million during 2016 related to this matter and on january 10, 2017, received tax assessments from the belgium government for a similar amount. the company has filed a complaint against the belgian tax assessments, and the result of this complaint, the appeal with the general court of the european union, new information received from the belgian government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed. our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. 26 state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-united states operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our business we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have a material adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , approximately 26 percent , 25 percent and 21 percent , respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the united states government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine and non-routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. in addition, violations of these regulations or other unrelated laws and statutes can lead to debarment and other penalties. if we fail to comply with procurement rules and regulations and other laws and statutes, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. an adverse action by the united states government could also result in lost sales to non-governmental customers who might disqualify us as a result of such adverse action. the impairment or loss of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business. operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. our intangible assets, including goodwill, represent a significant portion of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these 20 intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits concerning intellectual property, torts, contracts, shareholder litigation, administrative and regulatory proceedings and other matters, as well as governmental inquiries and investigations, the outcomes of which may be significant to our results of operations and may limit our ability to engage in our business activities. in recognition of these considerations, we have and may in the future enter into material settlements to avoid ongoing costs and efforts in defending or pursuing a matter. should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. while we have insurance related to our business operations, it may not apply to or fully cover liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits. we record accruals for liabilities where we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable. however, our actual costs may differ materially from these estimates. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 , international sales accounted for 47 percent , 46 percent and 47 percent , respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. certain of these products, particularly our thermal and infrared products, are subject to substantial government regulation and licensing and end use restrictions throughout the world. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products; restrictions and prohibitions on the export of technology and products, including recent changes in regulation prohibiting the sale of certain of our products to certain end users without a license; international trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and laws applicable to global trade and united states exports and costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations, including the costs associated with required remedial and other increased compliance activity; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. some of these factors recently have had an adverse impact on our sales and operations and increased the company's cost of doing business and subjected the business to additional rules, policies and procedures that impacted the operation of the company. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, compliance with complex foreign 21 and u.s. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business both in the united states and in international jurisdictions. these regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. for example, on april 8, 2015, the company and the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) entered into an agreement through entry of an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to section 21c of the securities and exchange act of 1934, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order (the sec order ). the sec order settled charges under the fcpa with respect to incidents of improper travel and gifts involving flir's middle east operation. pursuant to the sec order, the company is obligated to cease and desist from committing any future violations of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. in certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. further, although we have implemented and continue to implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations. in addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers export licenses and other authorizations are required from united states government agencies under the itar, the export administration regulation ( ear ), the office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) regulations, the trading with the enemy act of 1917, the international emergency economic powers act ( ieepa ), the arms export control act of 1976 ( aeca ), and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products and related data and services. thermal and infrared products and technical data have been subject to the itar and ear, historically under united states munitions list ( usml ) category xii and commerce control list ( ccl ) category 6. recently, the united states government's export reform effort resulted in the transition of various company products from the usml to the ccl, shifting the licensing requirements and restrictions for products regulated by the department of commerce under the ear. this transition has increased the licensing requirements and restrictions on some products and reduced the requirements and restrictions on others. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses from the united states department of state or department of commerce required to conduct our business as presently or historically conducted. the united states export licensing environment has been affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the aftermath of 9/11, the rise of terrorism and the changing geopolitical environment, heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time), and the united states reliance on the tactical advantage of the night-time war fighter. some of these factors have affected the thermal imaging and infrared technology industry overall while others have impacted the company directly. in addition, the company's 2014 submission to the united states department of state office of defense trade controls compliance ( ddtc ) pursuant to itar 127.12(c), regarding the unauthorized export of technical data and defense services to dual and third country nationals in at least four facilities of the company, have led to heightened scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets and in some cases, has resulted in lengthened drafting and review periods for our license applications, including in countries where we have historically made significant sales. subsequent engagement with the ddtc as part of the company's 2014 and related submissions and other communications concerning the company's licensing posture overall, highlight 22 ddtc's focus on the manner in which the company handles exports of its products, technical data and services subject to the itar. in addition, concerns with respect to potential diversion of certain of the company's products to prohibited end users and countries subject to economic and other sanctions implemented by the united states government has caused the united states department of commerce bureau of industry and security to restrict recently the company's ability to sell 9hz thermal products without a license to customers in china not identified on a list maintained by the united states department of commerce. although we have taken actions and continue to take additional actions necessary to implement policies and procedures to promote an improved compliance culture and programs, there is no guarantee that our actions will be effective or that government agencies will not view our actions and programs with heightened scrutiny, including as a result of events outside the company's control. as a result, we may receive more restrictive provisos or limitations on new license requests, wholesale denials of our license requests, suspensions or terminations of our existing licenses, or delays in receiving new licenses resulting from requests for follow-up information, due diligence requests or additional limitations on our sale to third parties. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining necessary licenses required to facilitate our international business. failures to obtain or delays in obtaining licenses may prevent or limit our ability to market, sell, export, or transfer our products outside the united states and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company's products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. in recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by united states government agencies, global economic weakness, and the eurozone crisis. continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results are an outcome of: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to utilize fully annual capital budgets prior to expiration. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition 23 from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims. it also could disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenues or translate into profits many contracts are subject to cancellation or suspension on short notice at the discretion of the customer, and the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contract. we have historically experienced variances in the components of backlog related to delivery delays or cancellations resulting from customer-specific circumstances, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control, and we may experience more delays or cancellations in the future. accordingly, there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized. if our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in revenues and a decline in profitability, which could result in a deterioration of our financial position and liquidity. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our technology and intellectual property our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 24 our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions we face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers' proprietary or classified information, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. we are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality. our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. we are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own. in particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly. such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years. further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. these technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user's inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and may contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers. these risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation. while we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures and controls, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information or corruption of data. we require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. we use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts. these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to induce by fraud employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. these security systems cannot provide absolute security. to the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems. moreover, if a security breach of our information technology system affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability. although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. nonetheless, in the future, these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems. they also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 25 risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our corporate structure and organization our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we must successfully manage a complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to manage effectively the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be unable to integrate successfully recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made twelve acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and borrowings against our unsecured credit facility, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. 26 we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations. our ability to refinance indebtedness, including the notes, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. in addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. a refinancing of our indebtedness, including the notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions. we are effectively self-insured against many potential liabilities although we maintain insurance policies with respect to a broad range of risks, including automobile liability, general liability, workers' compensation and employee group health, these policies do not cover all possible claims and certain of the policies are subject to large deductibles. accordingly, we are effectively self-insured for a substantial number of actual and potential claims. in addition, if any of our insurance carriers defaulted on its obligations to provide insurance coverage by reason of its insolvency or for other reasons, our exposure to claims would increase and our profits would be adversely affected. our estimates for unpaid claims and expenses are based on known facts, historical trends and industry averages, utilizing the assistance of actuarial services. the determination of such estimated liabilities and their appropriateness are reviewed and updated at least quarterly. however, these liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury or damage, the determination of liability in proportion to other parties, the timeliness of reported claims, the effectiveness of our risk management and safety programs and the terms and conditions of our insurance policies. our accruals are based upon known facts, historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses, and we believe such accruals are adequate. however, unknown or changing trends, risks or circumstances, such as increases in claims, a weakening economy, increases in medical costs, changes in case law or legislation or changes in the nature of the work we perform, could render our current estimates and accruals inadequate. in such case, adjustments to our balance sheet may be required and these increased liabilities would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known. insurance carriers may be unwilling, in the future, to provide our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and/or collateral requirements to cover our obligations to them. increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit and/or cash, and an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity. if insurance premiums increase, and/or if insurance claims are higher than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including belgium, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. for example, in january 2016, the european commission announced a decision concluding that certain rules under belgian tax legislation are deemed to be incompatible with european union regulations on state aid. as a result of this decision, the european commission has directed the belgian government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of the company's international subsidiaries. the belgian government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the general count of the european union, and in july 2016 the company filed a separate appeal with the general court of the european union. the company recorded discrete tax expense of $39.6 million during 2016 related to this matter and on january 10, 2017, received tax assessments from the belgium government for a similar amount. the company has filed a complaint against the belgian tax assessments, and the result of this complaint, the appeal with the general court of the european union, new information received from the belgian government, or other future events may cause the income tax provision associated with the decision to be entirely or partially reversed. our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; 27 changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. new tax legislation, commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ), was enacted on december 22, 2017. the tax act, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the us corporate income tax rate to 21% beginning in 2018, (ii) provides for a five year period of 100% bonus depreciation followed by a phase-down of the bonus depreciation percentage, and (iii) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to the deductibility of interest expense, the adoption of a modified territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or toll-charge on undistributed earnings and profits of us-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. the long-term impact of the tax act on the general economy cannot be reliably predicted at this time and will require rule-making and interpretation in a number of areas. the tax act requires complex computations not previously required by u.s. tax law. as such, the application of certain accounting guidance is currently evolving. further, compliance with the tax act and the accounting for certain provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. as a result, we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the tax act in our financial statements. as additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities, we will continue our analysis on the application of the tax act and will revise our current estimates in future periods. the revisions to our current estimates could materially affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-united states operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1, "nature of business and significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our business we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have a material adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , approximately 29 percent , 26 percent and 25 percent , respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. a failure to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government spending on our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the united states government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the united states government agencies. if annual appropriations bills are not timely enacted for fiscal year 2020 or beyond, the united states government may continue to operate under a continuing resolution. this could restrict new contract or program starts, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets. we may also face another united states government shutdown of unknown duration. if a prolonged government shutdown of the department of defense were to occur, it could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the united states government's ability effectively to progress programs and to make timely payments, limit our ability to obtain necessary export licenses to ship internationally, and limit our ability to perform on our united states government contracts and successfully compete for new work. consequently, significant delays or reductions in appropriations; long-term funding under a continuing resolution; an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown; and/or future budget and program decisions, among other items, may negatively impact our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine and non-routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. in addition, violations of these regulations or other unrelated laws and statutes can lead to debarment and other penalties. if we fail to comply with procurement rules and regulations and other laws and statutes, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. an adverse action by the united states government could also result in lost sales to non-governmental customers who might disqualify us as a result of such adverse action. the impairment or loss of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business. 19 operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance our long-term competitiveness. we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. our intangible assets, including goodwill, represent a significant portion of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits concerning intellectual property, torts, contracts, shareholder litigation, administrative and regulatory proceedings and other matters, as well as governmental inquiries and investigations, the outcomes of which may be significant to our results of operations and may limit our ability to engage in our business activities. in recognition of these considerations, we have and may in the future enter into material settlements to avoid ongoing costs and efforts in defending or pursuing a matter. should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. while we have insurance related to our business operations, it may not apply to or fully cover liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits. we record accruals for liabilities where we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable. however, our actual costs may differ materially from these estimates. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 , international sales accounted for 47 percent , 47 percent and 46 percent , respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. certain of these products, particularly our thermal and infrared products, are subject to substantial government regulation and licensing and end use restrictions throughout the world. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products; 20 restrictions and prohibitions on the export of technology and products, including any applicable changes in regulation prohibiting the sale of certain of our products to certain end users without a license; international trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and laws applicable to global trade and united states exports and costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations, including the costs associated with required remedial and other increased compliance activity; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and instability in economic or political conditions, inflation, recession, actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, and potential impact due to the upcoming exit of the united kingdom (the "u.k.") from the european union (the "eu"), colloquially referred to as "brexit". some of these factors recently have had an adverse impact on our sales and operations and increased our cost of doing business and subjected the business to additional rules, policies and procedures that impacted the operation of the company. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, compliance with complex foreign and united states laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business both in the united states and in international jurisdictions. these regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. for example, on april 8, 2015, the company and the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) entered into an agreement through entry of an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to section 21c of the securities and exchange act of 1934, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order (the sec order ). the sec order settled charges under the fcpa with respect to incidents of improper travel and gifts involving flir's middle east operation. pursuant to the sec order, we are obligated to cease and desist from committing any future violations of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended. violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. in certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. further, although we have implemented and continue to implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations. on april 24, 2018, we entered into a consent agreement with the united states department of state's directorate of defense trade controls ( ddtc ) to resolve allegations regarding the unauthorized export of technical data and defense services to dual and third country nationals in certain of our facilities, the failure to properly use and manage export licenses and export authorizations, and failures to report certain payments under 22 cfr part 130 in potential violation of itar. the consent agreement has a four-year term and provides for: (i) a civil penalty of $30 million with $15 million of this amount suspended on the condition that the funds have or will be used for department-approved consent agreement remedial compliance measures, (ii) the appointment of an external special compliance official to oversee compliance with the consent agreement and the itar; (iii) two external audits of our itar compliance program; and (iv) continued implementation of ongoing remedial compliance measures and additional remedial compliance measures related to automated systems and itar compliance policies, procedures, and training. during the three-month period ended march 31, 2018, we recorded a $15 million charge for the portion of the penalty that is not subject to suspension. as of december 31, 2018 , the remaining amounts payable of $3.5 million and $10.5 million have been recorded in other current liabilities and pension and other long-term liabilities, respectively. we expect recent and future investments in remedial compliance measures will be sufficient to cover the $15 million suspension amount. 21 as part of the consent agreement, ddtc acknowledged that we voluntarily disclosed certain of the alleged arms export control act and itar violations (which were resolved pursuant to the consent agreement), cooperated in ddtc's review, and instituted a number of compliance program improvements. in addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. we face risks from brexit brexit, which is scheduled to take place on march 29, 2019, has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the u.k. and the eu. a draft withdrawal agreement was published in november 2018, but we are still uncertain about the final agreements they will reach on topics such as financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, immigration laws, and employment laws. we have significant operations and a substantial workforce in europe, a portion of which reside in the u.k. and therefore enjoy certain benefits based on the u.k.'s membership in the eu. the lack of clarity about brexit and the future u.k. laws and regulations creates uncertainty for us, as the outcome of these negotiations may affect our business and operations. additionally, there also is a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu. the uncertainty surrounding brexit not only potentially affects our business in the u.k. and the eu, but may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing the european euro or british pound sterling could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency, such as our multicurrency credit facility. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers export licenses and other authorizations may be required from united states government agencies under the itar, the ear, the office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) regulations, the trading with the enemy act of 1917, the international emergency economic powers act ( ieepa ), the arms export control act of 1976 ( aeca ), and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products and related data and services. thermal and infrared products and technical data have been subject to the itar and ear, historically under united states munitions list ("usml") category xii and commerce control list ("ccl") category 6. the united states government's export reform effort resulted in the transition of various company products from the usml to the ccl, shifting the licensing requirements and restrictions for products regulated by the department of commerce under the ear. this transition has increased the licensing requirements and restrictions on some products and reduced the requirements and restrictions on others. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses from the united states department of state or department of commerce required to conduct our business as presently or historically conducted. the united states export licensing environment has been affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the aftermath of 9/11, the rise of terrorism and the changing geopolitical environment, heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time), and the united states reliance on the tactical advantage of the night-time war fighter. some of these factors have affected the thermal imaging and infrared technology industry overall while others have impacted us directly. in addition, the consent agreement and related submissions and other communications concerning our licensing posture overall have led to heightened scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets and, in some cases, highlight ddtc's focus on the manner in 22 which we handle exports of our products, technical data and services subject to the itar. in addition, concerns with respect to potential diversion of certain of our products to prohibited end users and countries subject to economic and other sanctions implemented by the united states government has caused the united states department of commerce bureau of industry and security to restrict our ability to sell 9hz thermal products without a license to customers in china not identified on a list maintained by the united states department of commerce. although we have taken actions and continue to take additional actions necessary to implement policies and procedures to promote an improved compliance culture and programs, there is no guarantee that our actions will be effective or that government agencies will not view our actions and programs with heightened scrutiny, including as a result of events outside of our control. as a result, we may receive more restrictive provisos or limitations on new license requests, wholesale denials of our license requests, suspensions or terminations of our existing licenses, or delays in receiving new licenses resulting from requests for follow-up information, due diligence requests or additional limitations on our sale to third parties. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining necessary licenses required to facilitate our international business. failures to obtain or delays in obtaining licenses may prevent or limit our ability to market, sell, export, or transfer our products outside the united states and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for our products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. in recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by united states government agencies, global economic weakness, and the eurozone crisis. continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, there is uncertainty around the implementation of brexit and its impact on us and global economic conditions generally. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results are an outcome of: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to utilize fully annual capital budgets prior to expiration. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the diverse markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, 23 research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims. it also could disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenues or translate into profits many contracts are subject to cancellation or suspension on short notice at the discretion of the customer, and the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contract. we have historically experienced variances in the components of backlog related to delivery delays or cancellations resulting from customer-specific circumstances, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control, and we may experience more delays or cancellations in the future. accordingly, there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized. if our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in revenues and a decline in profitability, which could result in a deterioration of our financial position and liquidity. significant tariffs, restrictions on imports or other trade barriers between the united states and various countries, most significantly china, may impact our revenue and results of operations in july 2018, the office of the u.s. trade representative announced a list of chinese imports that currently face tariffs of 10 percent. these tariffs may increase to 25 percent in march 2019 if the united states and china cannot reach an agreement on various related matters. these tariffs currently affect some of the components of our products we import from china, and we may raise our prices on those products due to the tariffs or share the cost of such tariffs with our customers, which could harm our operating performance or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers. it is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on our other imports, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results. in addition, we may seek to shift some of our manufacturing supply chain to other countries, which could result in disruption to our operations. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our technology and intellectual property our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the 24 markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions we face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers' proprietary or classified information, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. we are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality. our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. we are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own. in particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly. such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years. further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. these technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user's inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and may contain open source and third party software which may unbeknownst to us contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers. these risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation. while we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures, controls, and risk transfer mechanisms, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information, corruption of data, or financial loss. we require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. we use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts. these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to induce by fraud employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. these security systems cannot provide absolute security. to the extent we were to experience a breach of our systems and were unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems. moreover, if a security breach of our information technology system affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, 25 employees and other third parties, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability. although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. nonetheless, in the future, these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems. they also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our corporate structure and organization our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we must successfully manage a complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to manage effectively the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may be unable to integrate successfully recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made ten acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and borrowings against our unsecured credit facility, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes, and changes in the rate at which we can obtain indebtedness, any of which may limit our operational and financial flexibility 26 our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. our indebtedness may use libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. libor is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor, it could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations our ability to refinance indebtedness, including the notes, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. in addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. a refinancing of our indebtedness, including the notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions. we are effectively self-insured against many potential liabilities although we maintain insurance policies with respect to a broad range of risks, including automobile liability, general liability, workers' compensation and employee group health, these policies do not cover all possible claims and certain of the policies are subject to large deductibles. accordingly, we are effectively self-insured for a substantial number of actual and potential claims. in addition, if any of our insurance carriers defaulted on its obligations to provide insurance coverage by reason of its insolvency or for other reasons, our exposure to claims would increase and our profits would be adversely affected. our estimates for unpaid claims and expenses are based on known facts, historical trends and industry averages, utilizing the assistance of actuarial services. the determination of such estimated liabilities and their appropriateness are reviewed and updated at least quarterly. however, these liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury or damage, the determination of liability in proportion to other parties, the timeliness of reported claims, the effectiveness of our risk management and safety programs and the terms and conditions of our insurance policies. our accruals are based upon known facts, historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses, and we believe such accruals are adequate. however, unknown or changing trends, risks or circumstances, such as increases in claims, a weakening economy, increases in medical costs, changes in case law or legislation or changes in the nature of the work we perform, could render our current estimates and accruals inadequate. in such case, adjustments to our balance sheet may be required and these increased liabilities would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known. insurance carriers may be unwilling, in the future, to provide our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and/or collateral requirements to cover our obligations to them. increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit and/or cash, and an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity. if insurance premiums increase, and/or if insurance claims are higher than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including belgium, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. for example, in 2016, in accordance with fasb asc topic 740, "income taxes," we recorded discrete tax charges totaling $39.6 million related to the january 11, 2016 announcement from the european commission of a decision concluding that certain rules under belgian tax legislation were deemed to be 27 incompatible with european union regulations on state aid. as a result of this decision, the european commission directed the belgian government to recover past taxes from certain entities, reflective of disallowed state aid, which impacts one of our international subsidiaries. the belgian government announced they have appealed this decision and filed action for an annulment in the general court of the european union, and in july 2016 we filed a separate appeal with the general court of the european union. on january 10, 2017, we received tax assessments from the belgian government approximating the discrete tax charge recorded during 2016. we filed a complaint against the belgian tax assessments, and on october 23, 2018 the belgian government canceled $33.1 million of the tax assessments and accrued interest. as a result, we reversed a similar amount of previously accrued income tax plus interest associated with the assessments during the three-month period ending december 31, 2018. in addition, the euro equivalent of $35.7 million held in a restricted cash account as of september 30, 2018 became unrestricted during the three-month period ending december 31, 2018. while the company believes the matter has been effectively settled, an adverse opinion from the european commission regarding the cancellation of the tax assessments could be cause for accrual of tax in a future period. our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. for example, during the three-month period ending december 31, 2018, the swedish tax authority ( sta ) issued a reassessment of tax for the year ending december 31, 2012 to one of the company's non-operating subsidiaries in sweden. the reassessment concerns the use of tax credits applied against capital gains pursuant to european union council directive 2009/133/ec, commonly referred to as the eu merger directive, and assesses taxes and penalties totaling approximately $334.5 million (swedish kroner 3.0 billion ). we believe the sta's assertions in the reassessment are not in accordance with swedish tax regulations and plan to defend our positions with the sta and through the swedish court system, as necessary. consequently, no adjustment to our unrecognized tax benefits has been recorded in relation to this matter. we believe that our recorded tax liabilities are adequate in the aggregate for its income tax exposures. new tax legislation, commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ), was enacted on december 22, 2017. the tax act, among other things, (i) permanently reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 21 percent beginning in 2018, (ii) provides for a five year period of 100 percent bonus depreciation followed by a phase-down of the bonus depreciation percentage, and (iii) provides for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to the deductibility of interest expense, the adoption of a modified territorial tax system, assessing a repatriation tax or toll-charge on undistributed earnings and profits of u.s.-owned foreign corporations, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. the long-term impact of the tax act on the general economy cannot be reliably predicted at this time and continues to require rule-making and interpretation in a number of areas. the tax act requires complex computations not previously required by u.s. tax law. as such, the application of certain accounting guidance is currently evolving. further, compliance with the tax act and the accounting for certain provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. as additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities, we will continue our analysis on the application of the tax act and may need to revise our current estimates in future periods. the revisions to our current estimates could materially affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. 28 state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-united states operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1, "nature of business and significant accounting policies," to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our business we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have a material adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , approximately 32 percent , 29 percent and 26 percent , respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from sales to the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. a failure to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government spending on our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. substantial uncertainty exists in the spending levels and priorities of the united states government, particularly with respect to military expenditures. continued and further reductions in military spending could have a material adverse effect on our results from operations. considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the united states government agencies. any failure by the united states government to timely enact annual appropriations bills could restrict new contract or program starts, presenting resource allocation challenges and placing limitations on some planned program budgets. we may also face another united states government shutdown of unknown duration. if a prolonged government shutdown of the department of defense were to occur, it could result in program cancellations, disruptions and/or stop work orders and could limit the united states government's ability effectively to progress programs and to make timely payments, limit our ability to obtain necessary export licenses to ship internationally, and limit our ability to perform on our united states government contracts and successfully compete for new work. consequently, significant delays or reductions in appropriations; long-term funding under a continuing resolution; an extended debt ceiling breach or government shutdown; and/or future budget and program decisions, among other items, may negatively impact our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. as a united states government supplier, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations as a government contractor, we must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to routine and non-routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. u.s. government agencies, including the defense contract audit agency, the defense contract management agency and others, routinely audit and review a contractor's performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. they also review the adequacy of the contractor's compliance with government standards for its business systems. adverse findings in these investigations, audits, or reviews can lead to criminal, civil or administrative proceedings, and the company could face disallowance of previously billed costs, penalties, fines, compensatory damages and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. due to the company's reliance on government contracts, adverse findings could also have a material impact on the company's business, including its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 19 in addition, violations of these regulations or other unrelated laws and statutes can lead to debarment and other penalties as well as have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. if we fail to comply with procurement rules and regulations and other laws and statutes, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from united states government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. an adverse action by the united states government could also result in lost sales to non-governmental customers who might disqualify us as a result of such adverse action. the impairment or loss of our government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business. operating margins may be negatively impacted by reduction in sales or by a change in the mix of products sold our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance our long-term competitiveness. we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials at levels we believe are necessary to meet anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our fixed costs, including facilities and information technology costs, compliance and public company costs, and depreciation and amortization related to previous acquisitions and capital expenditures, are significant and are difficult to reduce in the short term. our operating margins vary by product and substantial changes in the mix of products sold could also have a negative impact on our operating margins. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. our intangible assets, including goodwill, represent a significant portion of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, the company recognized an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.2 million associated with intangible assets that were determined not to be recoverable due to a change in their expected future economic benefit. there can be no assurance that we will not experience other such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. unfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and could cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. from time to time, we are involved in lawsuits concerning intellectual property, torts, contracts, shareholder litigation, administrative and regulatory proceedings and other matters, as well as governmental inquiries and investigations, the outcomes of which may be significant to our results of operations and may limit our ability to engage in our business activities. in recognition of these considerations, we have and may in the future enter into material settlements to avoid ongoing costs and efforts in defending or pursuing a matter. should we fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against us in the same reporting period, we may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. while we have insurance related to our business operations, it may not apply to or fully cover liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits. we record accruals for liabilities where we believe a loss to be probable and reasonably estimable. however, our actual costs may differ materially from these estimated liabilities. 20 we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , international sales accounted for 45 percent , 47 percent and 47 percent , respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. certain of these products, particularly our thermal and infrared products, are subject to substantial government regulation and licensing and end use restrictions throughout the world. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental licensing restrictions and controls impacting our technology and products; restrictions and prohibitions on the export of technology and products, including any applicable changes in regulation prohibiting the sale of certain of our products to certain end users without a license; international trade restrictions, such as imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers; difficulty in collecting receivables and governmental restrictions with respect to currency; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restrictions on repatriation of prior earnings; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; risks, costs, impacts and obligations associated with the united states foreign corrupt practices act ("fcpa"), and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable to us, and laws applicable to global trade and united states exports and costs and penalties from violations of such laws and related regulations, including the costs associated with required remedial and other increased compliance activity; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; instability in economic or political conditions, inflation, recession, actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, and potential impact due to the exit of the united kingdom (the "u.k.") from the european union (the "eu"), colloquially referred to as "brexit"; and complications due to natural, nuclear or other disasters, such as outbreak of coronavirus. some of these factors recently have had an adverse impact on our sales and operations and increased our cost of doing business and subjected the business to additional rules, policies and procedures that impacted the operation of the company. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. for example, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china in late 2019. while we continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation related to the coronavirus, the chinese government's actions, particularly from quarantining individuals in and around major commercial hubs, such as wuhan, and restricting the opening of factories and operations, will likely have an impact, possibly material, on our supply chain and operations in china and availability of certain products produced in china in the short-term. the extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements for the export and sale of our products and operations worldwide that could adversely affect our business compliance with complex foreign and united states laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business both in the united states and in international jurisdictions. these regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the fcpa and the u.k. bribery act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy requirements, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. for example, on april 8, 2015, the company and the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) entered into an agreement through entry of an order instituting cease-and-desist proceedings pursuant to section 21c of the securities and exchange act of 1934, making findings, and imposing a cease-and-desist order (the sec order ). the sec order settled charges under the fcpa with respect to incidents of improper travel and gifts involving flir's middle east operation. pursuant to the sec order, we are obligated to cease and desist from committing any future violations of the securities exchange act of 21 1934, as amended. violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our reputation, business and results of operations. in certain foreign jurisdictions, there is a higher risk of fraud or corruption and greater difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls and compliance programs. further, although we have implemented and continue to implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies or applicable laws and regulations. on april 24, 2018, we entered into a consent agreement with the united states department of state's directorate of defense trade controls ( ddtc ) to resolve allegations regarding the unauthorized export of technical data and defense services to dual and third country nationals in certain of our facilities, the failure to properly use and manage export licenses and export authorizations, and failures to report certain payments under 22 cfr part 130 in potential violation of itar. the consent agreement has a four-year term and provides for: (i) a civil penalty of $30 million with $15 million of this amount suspended on the condition that the funds have or will be used for department-approved consent agreement remedial compliance measures, (ii) the appointment of an external special compliance official to oversee compliance with the consent agreement and the itar; (iii) two external audits of our itar compliance program; and (iv) continued implementation of ongoing remedial compliance measures and additional remedial compliance measures related to automated systems and itar compliance policies, procedures, and training. adverse findings in the audits of our itar compliance program could materially affect our competitive position and cause incurrence of additional expenses in connection with implementation of remedial measures and result in a substantial adjustment to our revenue and net income. during the three-month period ended march 31, 2018, we recorded a $15.0 million charge for the portion of the penalty that is not subject to suspension. as of december 31, 2019 , the remaining amounts payable of $3.5 million and $7.0 million have been recorded in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively. we expect recent and future investments in remedial compliance measures will be sufficient to cover the $15.0 million suspension amount. as part of the consent agreement, ddtc acknowledged that we voluntarily disclosed certain of the alleged arms export control act and itar violations (which were resolved pursuant to the consent agreement), cooperated in ddtc's review, and instituted a number of compliance program improvements. in addition, our international contracts may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or other financial obligations, known as offset obligations, and may provide for penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. we may not be successful in obtaining and maintaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments and customers export licenses and other authorizations may be required from united states government agencies under the itar, the ear, the office of foreign assets control ( ofac ) regulations, the trading with the enemy act of 1917, the international emergency economic powers act ( ieepa ), the arms export control act of 1976 ( aeca ), and other similar laws and regulations for the sale, use and export of many of our products and related data and services. thermal and infrared products and technical data have been subject to the itar and ear, historically under united states munitions list ("usml") category xii and commerce control list ("ccl") category 6. the united states government's export reform effort resulted in the transition of various company products from the usml to the ccl, shifting the licensing requirements and restrictions for products regulated by the department of commerce under the ear. this transition has increased the licensing requirements and restrictions on some products and reduced the requirements and restrictions on others. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses from the united states department of state or department of commerce required to conduct our business as presently or historically conducted. the united states export licensing environment has been affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the aftermath of 9/11, the rise of terrorism and the changing geopolitical environment, heightened tensions with other countries (which shift and evolve over time), and the united states reliance on the tactical advantage of the night-time war fighter. some of these factors have affected the thermal imaging and infrared technology industry overall while others have impacted us directly. in addition, the consent agreement and related submissions and other communications concerning our licensing posture overall have led to 22 heightened scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets and, in some cases, highlight ddtc's focus on the manner in which we handle exports of our products, technical data and services subject to the itar. in addition, concerns with respect to potential diversion of certain of our products to prohibited end users and countries subject to economic and other sanctions implemented by the united states government has caused the united states department of commerce bureau of industry and security to restrict our ability to sell 9hz thermal products without a license to customers in china not identified on a list maintained by the united states department of commerce. although we have taken actions and continue to take additional actions necessary to implement policies and procedures to promote an improved compliance culture and programs, during the normal course of our business, we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience violations of itar and ear, none of which has been material to the company to date. material violations of these legal requirements can be punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts, seizure and forfeiture of unlawful attempted exports, and/or denial of export privileges, as well as other remedial measures. we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us, our personnel and our agents to comply with applicable u.s. and international laws and regulations. however, there can be no guarantee that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us, our employees and our agents from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and violations, allegations or investigations of such violations could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. there is also no guarantee that government agencies will not view our actions and programs with heightened scrutiny, including as a result of events outside of our control. as a result, we may receive more restrictive provisos or limitations on new license requests, wholesale denials of our license requests, suspensions or terminations of our existing licenses, or delays in receiving new licenses resulting from requests for follow-up information, due diligence requests or additional limitations on our sale to third parties. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining necessary licenses required to facilitate our international business. failures to obtain or delays in obtaining licenses may prevent or limit our ability to market, sell, export, or transfer our products outside the united states and has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and our operating results. we face risks from brexit brexit has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the u.k. and the eu. the u.k. formally exited the eu on january 31, 2020 and has entered a transition period to negotiate the future relation terms with the eu. we have significant operations and a substantial workforce in europe, a portion of which reside in the u.k. and therefore enjoyed certain benefits based on the u.k.'s membership in the eu. the lack of clarity about brexit and the future u.k. laws and regulations creates uncertainty for us, as the outcome of these negotiations may affect our business and operations. for example, the imposition of tariffs following the brexit may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. additionally, there also is a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu. the uncertainty surrounding brexit not only potentially affects our business in the u.k. and the eu, but may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. additionally, any development that has the effect of devaluing the european euro or british pound sterling could meaningfully reduce the value of our assets and reduce the usefulness of liquidity alternatives denominated in that currency, such as our multicurrency credit facility. while we have adopted certain operational and financial measures to reduce the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such measures will be adequate to allow us to operate without disruption or adverse impact to our business and financial results in the affected regions. the long-term effects of brexit will depend on the agreements or arrangements with the eu for the u.k. to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. our earnings and profitability depend, in part, on subcontractor and supplier performance and financial viability as well as raw material and component availability and pricing we rely on other parties to provide raw materials, and components and subsystems for our products and to produce certain products or parts, provide information about the parts or products they supply to us, and perform some of the services we provide to our customers, and to do so in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors and suppliers, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreement with our subcontractors and suppliers, could have various impacts on the company, including on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. 23 our ability to perform our obligations on time could be adversely affected if one or more of our subcontractors or suppliers were unable to provide the agreed-upon products, materials or information, or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely, compliant and cost-effective manner or otherwise to meet the requirements of the contract. changes in political or economic conditions, including changes in defense budgets or credit availability or sanctions, or other changes impacting a subcontractor or supplier (including changes in ownership or operations), as well as their ability to retain talent and other resources, and requirements or changes in requirements imposed on them by other customers, could adversely affect the financial stability of our subcontractors and suppliers and/or their ability to perform. the inability of our suppliers to perform, or their inability to perform adequately, could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay or the need for us to provide other resources to support our existing suppliers. this risk may increase as the demands grow for our subcontractors and suppliers to meet extensive government-related cyber and other requirements. in connection with our u.s. government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the customer. we also are facing increased and changing regulatory requirements, both domestically and internationally, many of which apply to our subcontractors and suppliers. in some cases, there may be only one supplier, or one domestic supplier, for certain components. for example, a single domestic source currently supplies us, as well as the u.s. domestic solid propellant industry, with a principal raw material used in the production of solid rocket motors. if a supplier cannot appropriately meet our needs, experiences disruptions to production or is otherwise unavailable or not fully available, we may be unable to find a suitable alternative. our procurement practices are intended to reduce the likelihood of our procurement of counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials. we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms, including regarding the parts or materials we procure from them; in some circumstances, we rely on certifications provided by our subcontractors and suppliers regarding their compliance. we also rely on our subcontractors and suppliers effectively to mitigate the risk of cyber and security threats or other disruptions with respect to the products, components and services they deliver to us and the information entrusted to them by us or our customers and to comply with applicable contractual terms and laws and regulations, including cybersecurity requirements. if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform or we are unable to procure, or experience significant delays in deliveries of, needed products, materials or services; or if they do not comply with all applicable laws, regulations, requirements and contract terms, including if what we receive is counterfeit or otherwise improper, our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for our products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers' and suppliers' access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. in recent years, our performance has been negatively impacted by reduced spending by united states government agencies, global economic weakness, and the eurozone crisis. continuation of the conditions that led to reduced spending and potential further reductions in spending globally by either consumers or government agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 24 our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our products and solutions in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular fiscal quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results are an outcome of: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to utilize fully annual capital budgets prior to expiration. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the diverse markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new market entrants, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial product liability, damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims. it also could disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. as we expand our presence into new markets, we may face increased exposure to product liability claims. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it will be sufficient or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenues or translate into profits many contracts are subject to cancellation or suspension on short notice at the discretion of the customer, and the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contract. we have historically experienced variances in the components of backlog related to delivery delays or cancellations resulting from customer-specific circumstances, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control, and we may experience more delays or cancellations in the future. accordingly, there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized. if our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in revenues and a decline in profitability, which could result in a deterioration of our financial position and liquidity. significant tariffs, restrictions on imports or other trade barriers between the united states and various countries, most significantly china, may impact our revenue and results of operations general trade tensions between the u.s. and china began escalating in 2018, with multiple rounds of u.s. tariffs on chinese-made goods taking effect. these tariffs currently affect some of the components of our products we import from china, and we may 25 raise our prices on those products due to the tariffs or share the cost of such tariffs with our customers, which could harm our operating performance or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers. while we continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of the effective and proposed tariffs as well as other recent changes in foreign trade policy on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability and are considering strategies to mitigate such impact, including reviewing sourcing options and working with our vendors and merchants, it is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on our other imports, or that our business will be impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could materially harm our revenue or operating results. in addition, we may seek to shift some of our manufacturing supply chain to other countries, which could result in disruption to our operations. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our technology and intellectual property our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold worldwide patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. any failure by us to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the markets we serve, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. during the normal course of business, we engage in litigation related to our patents and other intellectual property and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, we may assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, leading to a potential reduction in client base. our business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions we face certain security threats and technology disruptions, including threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to our or our customers' proprietary or classified information, including intellectual property and technology, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, threats of terrorism events, and failures of our technology tools and systems. we are subject to laws and rules issued by various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining infrastructure and physical security and information confidentiality. our information technology networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to successfully perform day-to-day operations. we are also involved with information technology systems for certain customers and other third parties, for which we face similar security threats as for our own. in particular, cybersecurity threats-which include, but are not limited to, computer viruses, spyware and malware, attempts to access information, denial of service attacks and other electronic security breaches-are persistent and evolve quickly. such threats have increased in frequency, scope and potential impact in recent years. further, a variety of technological tools and systems, including both company-owned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties, support our critical functions. these technologies, as well as our products, are subject to failure and the user's inability to have such technologies properly supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies and may contain open source and third party software which 26 unbeknownst to us may contain defects or viruses that pose unintended risks to our customers. these risks if not effectively mitigated or controlled could materially harm our business or reputation. while we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures, controls, and risk transfer mechanisms designed to protect customer information and prevent data breaches, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential information, corruption of data, or financial loss. we require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. we use encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or accounts. these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularities. for example, third parties may attempt to induce by fraud employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. these security systems cannot provide absolute security. a material breach of our systems where we were unable to protect sensitive data could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise impact the use of our information technology systems. moreover, a security breach of our information technology system that affects our computer systems or results in the release of personally identifiable or other sensitive information of customers, business partners, employees and other third parties, could materially damage our reputation and brand, result in a decrease of the use of our products and services, and expose us to a risk of loss, litigation and potential liability. although we have in the past and continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and other security threats and technology disruptions, to date none has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. nonetheless, in the future, these types of events could disrupt our operations and customer and other third party information technology systems. they also could require significant management attention and resources, negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public and challenge our eligibility for future work on sensitive or classified systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. risks, uncertainties and other factors related to our corporate structure and organization our business strategy includes successfully managing acquisitions, investments and divestiture activities that complement our existing business. we may be unable to integrate successfully recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations our ongoing business model includes a certain level of ongoing acquisition, investment and divestiture activities. we must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divestitures, increased expenses associated with acquisitions or divestitures. furthermore, our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate from any acquisitions we make will depend in large part upon whether we are able to leverage the capabilities of the acquired companies to grow revenue across our combined organization, manage the acquired company's business, execute our strategy in an efficient and effective manner and realize anticipated cost synergies. in addition, private companies recently acquired which were previously not subject to section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ( sox ), may lack certain internal controls, which could ultimately affect our ability to ensure compliance with the requirements of sox. 27 we have made twelve acquisitions of various sizes in the past five years. we have also made one divestiture in fiscal year 2018. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions or divestitures in the future. such acquisitions or divestitures may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions and divestitures are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or divestitures. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders' ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions or divestitures, or that any such acquisition or investment, or divestiture will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our strategic restructuring will consolidate our business units and further concentrate our product mix which could increase risks related to the financial conditions of a more concentrated customer base and may not result in all of the intended benefits we have taken steps to implement a strategy-driven restructuring plan in order to simplify our product portfolio, improve operational efficiency, and drive long-term growth. restructuring efforts include consolidation of our business units, targeted workforce reductions, and facility optimization initiatives. these shifts could expose the company to a more concentrated customer base. the concentration of the company's customer base could increase its risks related to the financial conditions of its customers. in addition, changes in the market demand for the company's product mix could significantly affect our margins and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and future growth of the company. there is also a risk that our restructuring plan will not capture all of the intended benefits or may not result in the expected cost savings. further, the restructuring may yield unintended consequences such as attrition beyond our targeted workforce reduction. these risks may impact the company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we have indebtedness as a result of the issuance of our 3.125 percent senior unsecured notes (the notes ) and borrowings against our unsecured credit facility, and we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our unsecured credit facility and the indenture governing the notes, and changes in the rate at which we can obtain indebtedness, any of which may limit our operational and financial flexibility our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to meet our debt service obligations or comply with the required covenants could result in a default under the credit facility or indenture. in the event of any such default, under the credit facility, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. in the event of any such default under our indenture, either the trustee or the holders of at least 25 percent of the outstanding principal amount of the notes could declare the principal amount of all of the notes to be due and payable immediately. certain of our indebtedness is intrinsically linked to benchmark rates that are the subject of global benchmark rate reform. the phasing out of rates, such as libor, is expected to occur by 2021 and the market will transition to new benchmark rates. while we believe our exposure to market risk associated with the discontinuation of libor is limited because our notes carry a fixed-rate coupon and our unsecured credit facility agreement includes provisions for a successor rate, the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted or reasonably estimated. if libor is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor, it could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be 28 required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we must successfully manage a complex global organization as we have grown, the size and scope of our worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we currently design, manufacture and market numerous product lines in locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to manage effectively the increased complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, if at all, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations our ability to refinance indebtedness, including the notes, will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. in addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. a refinancing of our indebtedness, including the notes, could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon favorable terms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions. we may not be adequately insured against many potential liabilities although we maintain insurance policies with respect to a broad range of risks, including automobile liability, general liability, workers' compensation and employee group health, these policies do not cover all possible claims and certain of the policies are subject to large deductibles. accordingly, we are effectively self-insured for a substantial number of actual and potential claims. in addition, if any of our insurance carriers defaulted on its obligations to provide insurance coverage by reason of its insolvency or for other reasons, our exposure to claims would increase and our profits would be adversely affected. our estimates for unpaid claims and expenses are based on known facts, historical trends and industry averages, utilizing the assistance of actuarial services. the determination of such estimated liabilities and their appropriateness are reviewed and updated at least quarterly. however, these liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury or damage, the determination of liability in proportion to other parties, the timeliness of reported claims, the effectiveness of our risk management and safety programs and the terms and conditions of our insurance policies. our accruals are based upon known facts, historical trends and our reasonable estimate of future expenses, and we believe such accruals are adequate. however, unknown or changing trends, risks or circumstances, such as increases in claims, a weakening economy, increases in medical costs, changes in case law or legislation or changes in the nature of the work we perform, could render our current estimates and accruals inadequate. in such case, adjustments to our balance sheet may be required and these increased liabilities would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known. insurance carriers may be unwilling, in the future, to provide our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums and/or collateral requirements to cover our obligations to them. increased collateral requirements may be in the form of additional letters of credit and/or cash, and an increase in collateral requirements could significantly reduce our liquidity. if insurance premiums increase, and/or if insurance claims are higher than our estimates, our profitability could be adversely affected. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations we are subject to taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including sweden and belgium, where a number of our subsidiaries are organized. due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the enforcement environment, and changes in tax laws or their interpretations, in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions. our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of additional factors including: 29 the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; changes in foreign tax rates or agreed upon foreign taxable base; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. for example, during the three-month period ending december 31, 2018, the swedish tax authority ( sta ) issued a reassessment of tax for the year ending december 31, 2012 to one of the company's non-operating subsidiaries in sweden. the reassessment concerns the use of tax credits applied against capital gains pursuant to european union council directive 2009/133/ec, commonly referred to as the eu merger directive, and assesses taxes and penalties totaling approximately $321.3 million (swedish kroner 3.0 billion ). while we believe the sta's assertions in the reassessment are not in accordance with swedish tax regulations, if the sta is successful in its claim either in the short or long-term, the tax assessment could materially affect our results of operation, cash flow and financial position. as well, during 2019, the european commission announced the opening of a separate review to assess whether an excess profit tax ruling granted by belgium to one of our international subsidiaries is in breach of european union state aid rules. we believe we have paid all taxes assessed by belgium, yet an adverse opinion from the european commission regarding the applicability of state aid rules could be cause for material accrual of tax in a future period which could affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. new tax legislation, commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ), was enacted on december 22, 2017. the tax act requires complex computations not previously required by u.s. tax law and is subject to rule-making and interpretation in a number of areas. as such, the application of certain accounting guidance is currently evolving. further, compliance with the tax act and the accounting for certain provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced. as additional interpretative guidance is issued by the applicable authorities, we will continue our analysis on the application of the tax act and may need to revise our current estimates in future periods. the revisions to our current estimates could materially affect our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. state of oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our second restated articles of incorporation, as amended ( articles of incorporation") and fourth restated bylaws, as amended ( bylaws ), including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of the state of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. our bylaws designate a state court located within the state of oregon (or, if no state court located within the state of oregon has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of oregon) as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the state of oregon (or, if no state court located within the state of oregon has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the district of oregon) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any shareholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative 30 action or proceeding brought on behalf of the corporation, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of the corporation to the corporation or the corporation's shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against the corporation or any director or officer or other employee of the corporation arising pursuant to any provision of the obca, our articles of incorporation or our bylaws (as either may be amended or restated from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against the corporation, any director, officer or other employee of the corporation governed by the internal affairs doctrine. any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. this choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. section 27 of the exchange act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or the rules and regulations thereunder. as a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the exchange act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. in addition, section 22 of the securities act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or the rules and regulations thereunder. as a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the securities act or any other claim for which the federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-united states operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 , " nature of business and significant accounting policies ," to the consolidated financial statements inquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows. at december 31, 2002, no amounts were outstanding on any of the company credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. the company has assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies. assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom. the company investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long-term. the company does not engage in forward currency exchange contracts to reduce its economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. because the company markets, sells and licenses our products throughout the world, it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products. our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period-end exchange rates at december 31, 2002, was approximately $38.4 million. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $3.8 million at december 31, 2002. the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings.quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short-term and long-term debt obligations. the debt obligations are at variable rates. the company has not historically utilized interest rate swap or similar hedging arrangements to fix interest rates, but in march 2000, the company entered into interest rate swap agreements with one of its lender banks for a notional amount of $40.0 million. a change in interest rates on the debt obligations impacts the interest incurred and cash flows. a change in interest rates related to the swap agreements impacts interest incurred, cash flows and the fair value of the instrument. the sensitivity analysis related to the company debt obligation assumes a change of 10% in the variable interest rates from their levels of december 31, 2001 with all other variables held constant. a 10% increase in market interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2001. a 10% decrease in market interest rates would result in a decrease in interest expense of $0.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2001. the sensitivity analysis related to the company swap agreements assumes a change of 10% in the variable interest rates from their levels of december 31, 2001 with all other variables held constant. a 10% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in interest expense of $0.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2001 and a decrease in the fair value of the obligations of $0.2 million. a 10% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of $0.3 million for the year ended december 31, 2001 and an increase in the fair value of the obligation of $0.2 million. the company has assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies. assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom. the company investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long-term. accordingly, the company does not hedge these net investments. the company does not engage in forward currency exchange contracts to reduce its economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. because the company markets, sells and licenses our products throughout the world, it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows. at december 31, 2003, no amounts were outstanding on any of the company credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. the company convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0%. for fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. the fair value of the notes at december 31, 2003, was approximately $231 million compared to a carrying value of $204.4 million. the company has assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies. assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom. the company investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are generally considered long-term. the company does not engage in forward currency exchange contracts to reduce its economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. because the company markets, sells and licenses our products throughout the world, it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products. our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period-end exchange rates at december 31, 2003, was approximately $86.6 million. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $8.7 million at december 31, 2003. the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows. at december 31, 2004, no amounts were outstanding on any of the company credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. the company convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0%. for fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. the fair value of the notes at december 31, 2004, was approximately $343 million compared to a carrying value of $205.3 million. the company has assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies. assets and liabilities located outside the united states are

approximately $14.2 million at december 31, 2004. our net investment in foreign subsidiaries at december 31, 2003 was $86.6 million and the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates was $8.7 million. the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries. the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings.risk factors in addition to the factors discussed in the forward-looking statements section provided at the beginning of this annual report on form 10-k, the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. in addition, you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. if we were unable to adequately respond to any risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance. our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. due to these fluctuations, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. factors that may affect our future operating results include: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter, may cause variations in revenue and gross margins; a significant portion of our sales are made in the last month of each quarter, with sales frequently concentrated in the last week or days of the quarter; the timing and market acceptance of our or our competitors new products, product enhancements or technologies; our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of critical components; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; changes in our or our competitors pricing policies; our ability to collect on trade receivables; the timing and amount of any inventory write-downs; foreign currency fluctuations; the ability to secure export licenses for international sales orders; costs and risks associated with the acquisition and integration of other businesses, product lines or technologies; and general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally. 17 table of contents seasonal fluctuations in our operating results, particularly the increase in sales we generally experience every year in the fourth quarter, result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states and certain foreign governments; the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions, into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made numerous acquisitions of various sizes during our history. our most recent acquisitions include scientific materials corporation and brysen optical corporation during 2005 and indigo systems corporation in 2004. the indigo acquisition was large and significant effort was required to integrate indigo operations into ours. while we believe this integration has been successful, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in integrating future acquisitions. the integration of scientific materials and brysen optical into our operations is ongoing. these acquisitions are smaller in size than indigo, but there can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate them into our operations, nor can there be any assurance that the integration effort will not disrupt our operations or negatively affect our results of operations. this integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies is typically difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions or incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. it is possible that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and may in the near or long term pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, product lines or technologies. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. a reduction in government purchasing or our inability to act as a united states government contractor could significantly decrease revenue. a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to united states and foreign government agencies, and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales. aggregate direct and indirect sales to united states government agencies accounted for 33% and 40% of our revenue for the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. we have in the past and may in the future be adversely impacted by delays and uncertainties in the level and timing of government procurement activity and by governmental spending cuts and general budgetary constraints. we expect to continue seeking new government contracts for the design and long-term supply of thermal imaging devices. if we are not successful in winning such contracts, or do not perform our obligations on any such contracts we do secure, our future operating results may be adversely affected. our ability to do business with the united states government is conditioned upon our continuing eligibility to act as a federal contractor. a significant decline in our sales to united states or foreign governments or our disqualification from making such sales for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18 table of contents our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete. the thermal imaging industry is characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce cost and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2005, our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $194.1 million and represented 28% of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the total purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life, and review goodwill for impairment annually. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate, however there can be no assurances that such depreciation will not result in future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results from operations. we must successfully introduce new or enhanced products, enter into new markets and manage the costs associated with producing numerous product lines to be successful. our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our existing products and to develop new products using the latest technology that can satisfy customer requirements. for example, our near-term success will depend on the continued acceptance of our major product lines such as the star safire imaging product line and the thermacam p-series and e-series thermography product lines, sales of which we expect to generate a substantial amount of our revenue. we are also investing a significant percentage of our revenue on research and development with the objective of developing new products or enhancing existing products. we cannot be certain that our new products and product enhancements will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. in addition, the complexity associated with developing and maintaining multiple product lines may inhibit our ability to maintain or improve our profitability and may require significant management time and effort to effectively manage. our failure to complete the enhancement of these products, the failure of our current or future products to gain or maintain market acceptance or our failure to successfully manage our cost of production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. competition in the markets for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively would adversely affect our business. competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product features, performance, reliability and price. additionally, our products compete indirectly with numerous other products, such as image intensifiers and low-light cameras, for limited governmental and military funds. finally, many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development and 19 table of contents marketing resources than we do. all of these factors as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors requires us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand, increased costs and loss of revenue. we currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products. we have increased our internal sources of supply for certain critical components, in particular cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, optics and optical coatings, and laser components. we rely on numerous sole or limited source third party suppliers for various key components including laser designators and rangefinders, certain machined parts, optics, motors and electronic components. many of these suppliers are small and we are often one of their most important customers. our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that we are unable to source certain of these components on a timely basis or if such components are defective or they do not otherwise meet our performance standards. based on past experience, we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components. if critical components provided by any significant supplier become unavailable, our manufacturing operations would be disrupted. unless we have sufficient lead-time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components, we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices. any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad, and the united states congress may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments. export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. recently, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our market has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough if our sales decline. our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales, and these expenses are largely fixed, particularly in the short term. in addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. as a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical and sales personnel. our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and sales personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key senior managerial, technical and sales personnel or our 20 table of contents ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we also cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we have indebtedness as a result of the sale of our convertible notes. in june 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0% senior convertible notes due 2023 in a private offering pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933. as a result of this indebtedness, our principal and interest payment obligations have increased since then. our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. we face risks from international sales and currency fluctuations. we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, international sales accounted for 44% and 42%, respectively, of our total revenue. our international sales are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; political and economic instability; and general economic conditions. historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated or costs incurred have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims. we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. while we have not yet had to recall a product, if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, product defects could result in substantial product liability. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms. 21 table of contents our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business. our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. most of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors. likewise, we cannot be certain that measures taken to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily represent a barrier to entry into the thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future. defending intellectual property lawsuits and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities. an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if licenses were not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business could be harmed. we would be harmed if we were unable to use one of our facilities. we manufacture our products at facilities located in the portland, boston, stockholm and santa barbara areas. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, an earthquake, a prolonged power outage, fire or other natural disaster, would prevent us from supplying products to our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders. other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our shareholder rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. 22 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows. at december 31, 2005, no amounts were outstanding on any of our credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0%. for fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. the fair value of the notes at december 31, 2005, was approximately $246.8 million compared to a carrying value of $206.2 million. we have assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies. assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom. our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are considered long-term. we do not currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts or similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. because we market, sell and license our products throughout the world, we could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products. our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period-end exchange rates at december 31, 2005, was approximately $131.8 million. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $13.2 million at december 31, 2005. the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries. the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings. 34 table of contentsrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. in addition, you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. if we were unable to adequately respond to any risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance. our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. due to these fluctuations, we believe that 19 table of contents quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance. factors that may affect our future operating results include: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter; a significant portion of our sales are made in the last month of each quarter, with sales frequently concentrated in the last week or days of the quarter; the timing and market acceptance of our or our competitors new products, product enhancements or technologies; our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of critical components; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; changes in our or our competitors pricing policies; our ability to collect on trade receivables; the timing and amount of any inventory write-downs; foreign currency fluctuations; the ability to secure export licenses for international sales orders; costs and risks associated with the acquisition and integration of other businesses, product lines or technologies; and general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results, particularly the increase in sales we generally experience every year in the fourth quarter, result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions, into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations. we have made numerous acquisitions of various sizes during our history. our most recent acquisitions include scientific materials corporation and brysen optical corporation during 2005 and indigo systems corporation in 2004. the indigo acquisition was large and significant effort was required to integrate indigo operations into ours. while we believe this integration has been successful, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in integrating future acquisitions. this integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies is typically difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions or incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. it is possible that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our 20 table of contents financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and may in the near or long term pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses, product lines or technologies. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete. the thermal imaging industry is characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce cost and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2006, our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $200.7 million and represented 25% of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the total purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life, and review goodwill for impairment annually. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however there can be no assurances that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results from operations. we must successfully introduce new or enhanced products, enter into new markets and manage the costs associated with producing numerous product lines to be successful. our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our existing products and to develop new products using the latest technology that can satisfy customer requirements. we entered several new markets in 2006, including the automotive, recreational marine and low cost thermography markets, and expect these and other new markets to generate significant revenue in the future. the long term success of these products cannot be assured. we are also investing a significant percentage of our resources on research and development with the objective of developing new products or enhancing existing products. we cannot be certain that our new products and product enhancements will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. in addition, the complexity associated with developing and maintaining multiple product lines may inhibit our ability to maintain or improve our profitability and may require significant management time and effort to effectively manage. our failure to complete the enhancement of these products, the failure of our current or future products to gain or maintain market acceptance or our failure to successfully manage our cost of production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. competition in the markets for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively would adversely affect our business. competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging,

rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products. we have increased our internal sources of supply for certain critical components, in particular cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, optics and optical coatings, and laser components. we rely on numerous sole or limited source third party suppliers for various key components

resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough if our sales decline. our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales, and these expenses are largely fixed, particularly in the short term. in addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. as a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. 22 table of contents our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical and sales personnel. our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and sales personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. all key personnel, excluding those located in california, have signed non-competition agreements which limit their ability to join companies that directly or indirectly compete with us. we cannot, however, assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we have indebtedness as a result of borrowings under our credit facilities and the sale of our convertible notes. we have a $300 million credit agreement which was signed on october 6, 2006 under which we had $45.5 million outstanding as of december 31, 2006. additionally, in june 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0% senior convertible notes due 2023 in a private offering pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933. as a result of this indebtedness, our principal and interest payment obligations have increased. our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. we face risks from international sales and currency fluctuations. we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2006 and 2005, international sales accounted for 45% and 44%, respectively, of our total revenue. our international sales are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; political and economic instability; and general economic conditions. historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated or costs incurred have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in us dollars. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims. we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. while we have not 23 table of contents yet had to recall a product, if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, product defects could result in substantial product liability. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms. our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business. our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional

thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future. defending intellectual property lawsuits and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if licenses were not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business could be harmed. we would be harmed if we were unable to use one of our facilities. we manufacture our products at various facilities as described in item 2. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, an earthquake, a prolonged power outage, fire or

favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest 43 table of contents incurred and cash flows. at december 31, 2006, we had $45.5 million outstanding on our credit agreement. it is our intent to repay the $45.5 million outstanding in full by the end of the third quarter of 2007. we have determined that any change in interest rates during the first six months of 2007 will not materially impact our financial statements. our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0 percent. for fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. the fair value of the notes at december 31, 2006, was approximately $322.0 million compared to a carrying value of $207.0 million. we have assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are denominated in foreign currencies. assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom. our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are considered long-term. we do not currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts or similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. because we market, sell and license our products throughout the world, we could be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products. our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period-end exchange rates at december 31, 2006, was approximately $211.6 million. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $21.2 million at december 31, 2006. the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries. the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings.risk fac tors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. in addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our thermal imaging systems in a variety of commercial, industrial, and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally; the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given quarter, as a significant portion of our sales are frequently concentrated in the last week or days of a quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results, particularly the increase in sales we generally experience every year in the fourth quarter, result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. 11 table of contents we depend on the us government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts with us government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 39%, 32% and 33%, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from contracts with the us government and its agencies. recently, a higher percentage of our contracts are larger indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (idiq) contracts. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall us government budget and appropriation process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the us government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. as a us government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by us government agencies. if we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete and our ability to introduce new or enhanced products, and enter into new markets the thermal imaging industry is characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. we must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization as the revenue of the company has increased, the size and scope of the company worldwide operations has also increased substantially. worldwide operations have grown to accommodate the design, manufacture and marketing of numerous product lines across each of our three divisions, in a vertically integrated manufacturing environment. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business. our failure to successfully manage the global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we manufacture our products at various facilities as described in item 2. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, an earthquake, a prolonged power outage, fire or other natural disaster, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, international sales accounted for 39%, 45% and 44% respectively, of our total revenue. our international sales are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; 12 table of contents trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; political and economic instability; and general economic conditions. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. operating margins may be negatively impacted by a downturn in sales our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales, and these expenses are largely fixed, particularly in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would be maintained in the event of a sales downturn, in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. in addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. as a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. competition in the markets for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. in addition, many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future, and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand, increased costs and loss of revenue we currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products. we have increased our internal sources of supply for certain critical components, in particular, cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, optics and optical coatings, and laser components, but we rely on numerous sole or limited source third-party suppliers for other key components including laser designators and rangefinders, certain machined parts, optics, motors and electronic components. many of these suppliers are small and we are often one of their most important customers. our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that we are unable to source certain of these components on a timely basis or if such components are defective or they do not otherwise meet our performance standards. 13 table of contents based on past experience, we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components. if critical components provided by any significant supplier become unavailable, our manufacturing operations could be disrupted. unless we have sufficient lead-time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components, we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices. any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. as permitted by applicable law, our key personnel have signed non-competition agreements which limit their ability to join or establish companies that directly or indirectly compete with us. we cannot, however, assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made several acquisitions of various sizes during our history, including six in the past five years. our most recent acquisitions include cedip infrared systems in 2008 and extech instruments corporation in 2007. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies is typically difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is possible that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may range in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2007, our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $229.0 million and represented 22% of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life, and review goodwill for impairment annually. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurances that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14 table of contents we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated or costs are incurred have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in us dollars. with respect to international sales denominated in us dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could make our products less price competitive. our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold us patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future or that we will not assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad, and the us government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments export licenses are required from us government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. recently, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses (including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims), disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a 15 table of contents material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms. we have indebtedness as a result of borrowings under our credit facility and the sale of our convertible notes and are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our credit facility which may limit our operational and financial flexibility we have entered into a $300 million credit agreement which on october 6, 2006 under which we had $19.0 million outstanding as of december 31, 2007. the credit agreement contains five financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth, a maximum level of capital expenditures and, commencing december 31, 2009, a minimum liquidity of cash and availability under the credit agreement. additionally, in june 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0% senior convertible notes due in 2023 in a private offering pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended. our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement. in the event of any such default, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. if we are unable to repay any of this debt when due, the lenders under our credit facility could foreclose on our assets pledged to them as security. if the indebtedness under our credit facility were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full. changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or the repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the us internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. 16 table of contents oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our shareholder rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows. at december 31, 2007, we had $19.0 million outstanding under our credit agreement. it is currently our intention to repay the $19.0 million outstanding in full by the end of the first quarter of 2008. we have determined that any change in interest rates during the first three months of 2008 will not materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0 percent. for fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. the fair value of the notes at december 31, 2007, was approximately $603.0 million compared to a carrying value of $207.9 million. we have assets, liabilities, and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are denominated in foreign currencies. assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom. our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are considered long-term. we do not currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts or similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates. because we market, sell and license our products throughout the world, we could be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products. our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, translated into us dollars using the period-end exchange rates at december 31, was approximately $290.7 million and $211.6 million at december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately $29.1 million and $21.2 million at december 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries. the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore, foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings.risk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. in addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. general economic conditions and the current global financial crisis may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending, which have recently deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed, or be subject to further deterioration. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company products include uncertainty about current global economic conditions leading to reduced 11 table of contents levels of investment, changes in government spending priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers and suppliers access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. the recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in reduced liquidity and a tightening of credit markets. as a result of these conditions, the company could experience several potential adverse effects, including the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the company products, the insolvency of customers resulting in reduced sales and bad debts, and the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product development and production delays. we invest our cash and cash equivalents in instruments that may be exposed to credit market distress, including the failure of financial institutions and market illiquidity. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our thermal imaging systems in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: general economic conditions, both domestically and internationally; the timing, number and

contracts or subcontracts with united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 41 percent, 39 percent and 32 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from contracts with the united states government and its agencies. recently, a higher percentage of our contracts have been larger indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity ( idiq ) contracts. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriation process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. as a united states government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. if we fail to comply with these 12 table of

product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and

be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. we must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization as the company has grown, the size and scope of the company worldwide operations have also increased substantially. worldwide operations have grown to accommodate the design, manufacture and marketing of numerous product lines across each of our three divisions in a vertically integrated manufacturing environment. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business. our failure to successfully manage the global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we manufacture our products at various facilities as described in item 2. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, international sales accounted for 38 percent, 39 percent and 45 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products in europe. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 13 table of contents operating margins may be negatively impacted by a downturn in sales our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed, particularly in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. in addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. as a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. competition in the markets for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. dependence on sole source and

or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we 15 table of contents rely on a combination of patent, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future or that we will not assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. recently, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms. we have indebtedness as a result of the sale of our convertible notes and are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our credit facility which may limit our operational and financial flexibility in june 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0 percent senior convertible notes due in 2023 in a private offering pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended, of which as of december 31, 2008, approximately $191.4 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes were outstanding. on february 5, 2009, we commenced an exchange offer for any and all of the outstanding convertible notes. the offer was made pursuant to an offer to exchange and related documents, each dated february 5, 2009, and the completion of the 16 table of contents offer is subject to conditions described in the offer documents. holders who elect to exchange their notes in this offer and whose notes are accepted for exchange by us will receive 90.1224 shares of our common stock and a cash payment of $20 per $1,000 principal amount of notes. the offer is scheduled to expire on march 9, 2009 unless extended by us. we are making this offer to reduce the amount of our outstanding debt and interest expense. additionally, we have a $300 million revolving credit agreement. the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth, a maximum level of capital expenditures and, commencing december 31, 2009, a minimum level of liquidity comprised of cash and undrawn/unutilized availability under the credit agreement. the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the company. as of december 31, 2008, there were no amounts borrowed and outstanding under the credit agreement. the credit agreement expires on october 6, 2011. our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement. in the event of any such default, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. if we are unable to repay any of this debt when due, the lenders under our credit facility could foreclose on our assets pledged to them as security. changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. oregon law, our charter documents and our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions 17 table of contents of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of oregon law and our shareholder rights plan, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates under the credit agreements impacts the interest that we incur and our cash flows. at december 31, 2008, no amounts were outstanding under our credit agreement; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0 percent. for fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. the fair value of the notes at december 31, 2008, was approximately $507.4 million compared to a carrying value of $190.3 million. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the fair value would be approximately $50.7 million. we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. in addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending and the recent worldwide recession has negatively impacted demand in many of our markets. these markets may remain weak, or be subject to further deterioration. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company products include continued uncertainty about current global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers and suppliers access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our thermal imaging systems in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter; the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results, particularly the increase in sales we generally experience in the fourth quarter, result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. 12 we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts with united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 43 percent, 41 percent and 39 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from contracts with the united states government and its agencies. recently, a higher percentage of our contracts have been larger indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity ( idiq ) contracts. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriation process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. as a united states government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. if we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete, including the thermal imaging industry, are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. we must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization as the company has grown, the size and scope of the company worldwide operations have also increased substantially. worldwide operations have grown to accommodate the design, manufacture and marketing of numerous product lines across all of our divisions in a vertically integrated manufacturing environment. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased complexity of the business. in december 2009, we announced a reorganization whereby we would consolidate the thermography division and the commercial systems division into one division, called commercial systems, effective january 1, 2010. our failure to successfully manage the global operations and integration of the two divisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we manufacture our products at various facilities as described in item 2. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2009, 2008 and 13 2007, international sales accounted for 41 percent, 38 percent and 39 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. operating margins may be negatively impacted by a downturn in sales our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. in addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. as a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14 dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand, increased costs and loss of revenue we currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products. we have increased our internal sources of supply for certain critical components, in particular, cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, optics and optical coatings, and laser components, but we rely on sole or limited source third-party suppliers for other key components including laser rangefinders, certain machined parts, optics, motors and electronic components. many of these suppliers are small and we are often one of their most important customers. our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that we are unable to source certain of these components on a timely basis or if such components are defective or they do not otherwise meet our performance standards. based on past experience, we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components. if critical components provided by any significant supplier become unavailable, our manufacturing operations could be disrupted. unless we have sufficient lead-time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components, we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices. any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made several acquisitions of various sizes during our history, including eleven in the past seven years. our most recent acquisitions include salvador, omnitech, and directed perception in 2009. the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15 we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2009, our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $321.5 million and represented 22 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are exposed to worldwide financial markets financial markets are volatile. changes in the availability of credit and the perceived and actual market risk of financial instruments can have numerous potential adverse effects, including the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products, the insolvency of customers resulting in reduced sales and bad debts, and the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product development and production delays. we invest our cash and cash equivalents in instruments that may be exposed to credit and market risk, including default, the failure of financial institutions and market illiquidity. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. 16 litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. recently, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms. we have indebtedness as a result of the sale of our convertible notes and are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our credit facility which may limit our operational and financial flexibility in june 2003, we issued $210 million of 3.0 percent senior convertible notes due in 2023 in a private offering pursuant to rule 144a under the securities act of 1933, as amended, of which as of december 31, 2009, approximately $58.8 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes were outstanding. additionally, we have a $300 million revolving credit agreement. the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios, in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth, a maximum level of capital expenditures and, commencing december 31, 2009, a minimum level of liquidity comprised of cash and undrawn/unutilized availability under the credit agreement. the credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all assets of the company. as of december 31, 2009, there were no amounts borrowed and outstanding under the credit agreement. the credit agreement expires on october 6, 2011. our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement. in the event of any such default, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the 17 facility to be due and immediately payable. if we are unable to repay any of this debt when due, the lenders under our credit facility could foreclose on our assets pledged to them as security. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates under the credit agreements impacts the interest that we incur and our cash flows. at december 31, 2009, no amounts were outstanding under our credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 3.0 percent. for fixed rate debt, interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows. the fair value of the notes at december 31, 2009, was approximately $173.4 million compared to a carrying value of $58.0 million. the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the fair value would be approximately $17.3 million. we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements inrisk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. in addition, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant. if we are unable to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. additionally, we cannot be certain or give any assurance that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective. general economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of capital investment and consumer spending. economic factors that could adversely influence demand for the company products include uncertainty about global economic conditions leading to reduced levels of investment, changes in government spending levels and/or priorities, the size and availability of government budgets, customers and suppliers access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting government, industrial or consumer spending behavior. our primary markets are volatile and unpredictable our business depends on the demand for our thermal imaging systems in a variety of commercial, industrial and government markets. in the past, the demand for our products in these markets has fluctuated due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including: the timing, number and size of orders from, and shipments to, our customers, as well as the relative mix of those orders; variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter; 22 table of contents the size and timing of new contract awards; the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products; and the timing of orders and shipments within a given fiscal quarter. seasonal fluctuations in our operating results result from: the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments; the desire of customers to take delivery of equipment prior to fiscal year ends due to funding considerations; and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration. we depend on the united states government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business we derive significant revenue from contracts or subcontracts funded by united states government agencies. a significant reduction in the purchase of our products by these agencies or contractors for these agencies would have an adverse effect on our business. for the fiscal years ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 34 percent, 43 percent and 41 percent, respectively, of our revenues were derived directly or indirectly from contracts with the united states government and its agencies. the funding of contracts awarded to us depends on the overall united states government budget and appropriations process, which is beyond our control. in addition, at its discretion, the united states government may change its spending priorities and/or terminate, reduce or modify contracts. as a united states government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements and are subject to routine audits and investigations by united states government agencies. if we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, the results could include: reductions in the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the assessment of penalties and fines; and/or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time or permanently. our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete, our ability to introduce new or enhanced products and enter into new markets the markets in which we compete, including the thermal imaging industry, are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications. our ability to develop new products and technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements, reduce costs and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position in existing and new markets will be an important factor in our future results from operations. we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability, reduce costs, and develop and introduce new products and enhancements. if we fail to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. in addition, we cannot be certain that our new products and technologies will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products. we must successfully manage an increasingly complex global organization as the company has grown, the size and scope of the company worldwide operations have also increased substantially. we now design, manufacture and market numerous product lines across our segments in numerous locations worldwide. significant management time and effort is required to effectively manage the increased 23 table of contents complexity of the business and our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, we manufacture our products at various facilities. our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of, for example, a prolonged power outage, earthquake, fire or other natural disaster, or labor or political unrest, could prevent us from supplying products to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from international sales and business activities we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a significant portion of our revenue. for the years ended december 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, international sales accounted for 47 percent, 41 percent and 38 percent, respectively, of our total revenue. we also manufacture certain products and subassemblies in europe and we have several contract manufacturing agreements with third parties in europe and in asia. our international business activities are subject to a number of risks, including: the imposition of and changes to governmental controls; restrictions on the export of critical technology; trade restrictions; difficulty in collecting receivables; inadequate protection of intellectual property; labor union activities; changes in tariffs and taxes; restriction on the importation and exportation of goods and services; compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and political and economic instability. no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and, consequently, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. operating margins may be negatively impacted by a downturn in sales our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future sales and these expenses are largely fixed in the short term. some expenses, such as those related to research and development activities, would likely be maintained in the event of a sales downturn in order to maintain and enhance the long-term competitiveness of the company. in addition, to enable us to promptly fill orders, we maintain inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials. as a result, we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales. accordingly, we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales. any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods, components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs. 24 table of contents competition in our markets is intense and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business competition in the markets for our products is intense. the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging, develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low prices to the market are important competitive factors. we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product performance, price, customer service and training, product reputation, and effective marketing and sales efforts. many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. all of these factors, as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors, require us to continue to invest in, and focus on, research and development and new product innovation. no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand, increased costs and loss of revenue we currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products. we have increased our internal sources of supply for certain critical components, in particular, cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, coolers, optics and optical coatings, and laser components, but we rely on sole or limited source third-party suppliers for other key components including laser rangefinders, gyros, inertial measurement units, certain machined parts, optics, motors and electronic components. many of these suppliers are small and we are often one of their most important customers. our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that we are unable to source certain of these components on a timely basis or if such components are defective or they do not otherwise meet our performance standards. based on past experience, we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components. if critical components provided by any significant supplier become unavailable, our manufacturing operations could be disrupted. unless we have sufficient lead-time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components, we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices. any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical, sales and other personnel our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and other personnel. significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives, technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract, integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future. we cannot assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us. if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our operations, thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations we have made thirteen acquisitions of various sizes in the past eight years. our most recent acquisitions include raymarine and icx in 2010 and salvador, omnitech and directed perception in 2009. raymarine and icx are among the largest acquisitions we have completed and the integration of businesses, personnel, product lines and technologies can be difficult, time consuming and subject to significant risks. for example, we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire, incur unanticipated costs, lose major sources of revenue, fail 25 table of contents to integrate critical technologies, suffer business disruptions, fail to capture anticipated synergies, fail to establish satisfactory internal controls, or incur unanticipated liabilities. any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and decrease our revenue. we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and it is likely that we will make additional acquisitions in the future. such acquisitions may vary in size and complexity. any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above. furthermore, we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions. additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our financial risk, and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership. no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions, or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets. as of december 31, 2010, our intangible assets, including goodwill, totaled $659.4 million and represented 36 percent of our total assets. most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired. we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life and review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted by events. to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets, but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future. in addition, certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products, changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns. we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate; however, there can be no assurance that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks from currency fluctuations historically, currency fluctuations have affected our operating results. changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales or costs incurred are denominated have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, fluctuations in our operating results. we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating, where possible, our international sales in united states dollars, by balancing expenses and revenues in various currencies and by undertaking limited hedging of forecasted currency exposures. with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive. our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others. to accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents, making them more difficult to protect. although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products, and we are actively pursuing additional patents, we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology, products and trade names. furthermore, we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors or that measures taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure. any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 26 table of contents moreover, because intellectual property does not necessarily prevent our competitors from entering the thermal imaging industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that our competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours. litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry. we have been the subject of patent and other intellectual property litigation in the past and cannot be sure that we will not be subject to such litigation in the future. similarly, there exists the possibility we will assert claims in litigation to protect our intellectual property. lawsuits defending or prosecuting intellectual property claims and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel. an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding in which we are a party could subject us to significant liabilities, result in the loss of intellectual property rights we claim or impact our competitive position. additionally, an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties. if such licenses are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad and the united states government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act, the trading with the enemy act of 1917 and the arms export control act of 1976 for export of many of our products. we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses. in the aftermath of 9/11, heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our markets has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications. failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely on information systems, electronic communication systems, internal and external data and application software in our operations. systems failures, security breaches and other disruptions, whether internal or external, could have an adverse affect on our business and results of operations the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware, software and communication systems. even the most well protected information systems are vulnerable to systems failures. such failures could be caused by internal or external events such as incursions by intruders or hackers, computer viruses, power shortages or cyber terrorists. the unavailability of the information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous effects, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and increased overhead costs and the loss or compromise of important information or data, causing our business and results of operations to be adversely affected. our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. if any of our products are defective, we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. such an event could result in significant expenses including expenses arising from product liability and warranty claims, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms. 27 table of contents we are subject to certain restrictive covenants under our credit facility which may limit our operational and financial flexibility on february 8, 2011, we replaced our $300 million secured revolving credit agreement with a new $200 million unsecured revolving credit agreement. both agreements contain financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. as of december 31, 2010, there were no amounts borrowed and outstanding under the $300 million credit agreement. the $200 million credit agreement expires on february 8, 2016. our ability to meet our debt service obligations and comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. our inability to comply with the required financial covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement. in the event of any such default, the lenders under our credit facility could elect to declare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees under the facility to be due and immediately payable. changes in our effective income tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including: the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes; changes in available tax credits; changes in share-based compensation expense; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and/or the repatriation of earnings from outside the united states for which we have not previously provided for united states taxes. any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact net income for future periods. in addition, the united states internal revenue service ( irs ) and other tax authorities regularly examine our income tax returns. our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if any assessments resulting from the examination of our income tax returns by the irs or other taxing authorities are not resolved in our favor. oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us. an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders, including an increase in the value of our common stock. some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders, as well as provisions of oregon law, may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements. the credit agreements are at variable rates. a change in interest rates under the credit agreements impacts the interest that we incur and our cash flows. at december 31, 2010, no amounts were outstanding under our credit agreements; consequently, no sensitivity analysis is presented. we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. similarly, certain revenues from products sold in countries outside the united states and costs associated with non-us operations are denominated in foreign currencies. for more information on our foreign currency translation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in
