quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information concerning market risk is contained on pages b-43 through b-45 of ti's proxy statement for the 2001 annual meeting of stockholders and is incorporated by reference to such proxy statement.risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment 9 community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance. semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue. the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations, and on the market price of our securities. the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key end-equipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix. in addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment. we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles. moreover, expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. as a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products. there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers, nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. with regard to our own intellectual property, we actively enforce and protect our rights. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology. we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements. the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses. there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful. future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. additionally, 10 consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements. a decline in demand in certain end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. our customer base includes companies in a wide range of end-user markets, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications- and computer-related industries and from sales to industrial customers. within these end-user markets, a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone, personal computer and communications infrastructure markets. decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition. our global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal, political, economic or other changes. we have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide, and about 90 percent of our revenue comes from sales to locations outside the united states. operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate. any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. additionally, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers (including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments) may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, critical manufacturing equipment, manufacturing processes and third-party manufacturing services. our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits. we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. a limited number of third parties perform these functions, and we do not have long-term contracts with all of them. reliance on these third parties involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, the third parties' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective and appropriate 11 manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. our operations could be affected by changes in environmental, safety and health laws and regulations. we are subject to environmental, safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business, particularly those in which we manufacture our products. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business, particularly if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments. if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill. a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from, among other things, unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit, may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill. most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls or product liability. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such 12 insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described under item 1a, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations, or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity, or the disposition of assets. our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions could affect our business plans and results of operations. in september 2011, we acquired national semiconductor corporation. such a transaction can involve significant integration challenges and there can be no assurance that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to the acquisition. if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the acquired operations, product lines and technology, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition, which could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information contained under the caption quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in our 2011 annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in

revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements. a decline in demand in certain end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. our customer base includes companies

united states; in particular, shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue. operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. additionally, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 11 our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our

or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls or product liability. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described under item 1a, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations, or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity, or the disposition of assets. 13 our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. from time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. for example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition. further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems. we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism. compromise of our information technology networks could result in unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information, cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, or result in release of employee personal data, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information contained under the caption

misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology. we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements. the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses. there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful. future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. additionally, 10 consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements. a decline in demand in certain markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. our customer base includes companies in a wide range of markets, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the personal electronics market, particularly the mobile phone sector, and from sales to industrial customers. decline in one of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition. our global operations subject us to complex laws, regulations and policies and risks associated with international political, economic or other conditions. we have facilities in 35 countries worldwide. about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; in particular, shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue. our global operations subject us to complex u.s. and foreign laws, regulations and policies relating to, for example, trade and export controls, anti-bribery, antitrust and privacy. violations of or changes in these laws, regulations and policies could result in fines, penalties, and sanctions that could adversely affect our results of operations. operating internationally also exposes us to political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. additionally, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide. the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers (including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments) may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance. in 2013, about 55 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and for some distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. 11 incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, critical manufacturing equipment, manufacturing processes and third-party manufacturing services. our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of some of our customers and suppliers, require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits. we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. a limited number of third parties perform these functions, and we do not have long-term contracts with all of them. reliance on these third parties involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, the third parties' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. our operations could be affected by changes in environmental, safety and health laws and regulations. we are subject to environmental, safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business, particularly those in which we manufacture our products. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business, particularly if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of 12 operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments. if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill. a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from, among other things, unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit, may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill. most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls or product liability. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described under item 1a, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations, or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity, or the disposition of assets. our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. from time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. for example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition. further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. 13 our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems. breaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism could compromise our information technology networks and result in unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information, cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, result in release of employee personal data, or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information contained under the caption quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in our 2013 annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance. semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue. the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations, and on the market price of our securities. our results of operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key end-equipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix. in addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. the markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment. we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. moreover, expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured, so we may not be able to successfully develop and market these new products. we do not expect that all of our r&amp;d projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale, or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed. further, the products we do 8 develop and market might not be well-received by customers, and we might not realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. for example, the china market is highly competitive, and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share. additionally, we may face increased competition as a result of china's adoption of policies designed to promote its domestic semiconductor industry. certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. with regard to our own intellectual property, we actively enforce and protect our rights. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology. we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements. the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses. there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful. future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. additionally, consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements. a decline in demand in certain markets or sectors could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. our customer base includes companies in a wide range of markets and sectors within those markets, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the personal electronics and communications equipment markets. decline in one or more sectors within these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition. our global operations subject us to risks associated with international political, economic or other conditions. we have facilities in 35 countries. about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; in particular, shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue. operating internationally exposes us to political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. additionally, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 9 our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as health epidemics, severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide. the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers (including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments) may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance. in 2014, about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, critical manufacturing equipment, manufacturing processes and third-party manufacturing services. our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of some of our customers and suppliers, require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. our inability

results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in 35 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. we have not made a provision for u.s. income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings, we might incur incremental u.s. income tax, which could affect our results of operations. our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. we are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, environmental, safety and health; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. some of these complex laws, rules and regulations for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings

carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls, product liability claims, or legal proceedings. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the

undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. for example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully

information technology systems or those of our customers or suppliers could be caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism. these breaches could compromise our information technology networks or those of our customers or suppliers and could result in unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information, cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, result in release of employee personal data, or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. foreign exchange risk the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. our non-u.s. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars or other currencies. exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently on our effective tax rate. our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-u.s. dollar currencies. because most of the aggregate non-u.s. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2014 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-u.s. currency exchange rates would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million. we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-u.s. dollar net balance sheet exposures. for example, at year-end 2014, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $504 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $183 million to sell japanese yen, $163 million to sell euros and $29 million to sell british pound sterling). similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2013. interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. 25 as of december 31, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $12 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $128 million. because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. equity risk long-term investments at year-end 2014 include the following: investments in mutual funds includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. investments in venture capital funds includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method). equity investments includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost. impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in net income. investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. see note 9 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 26risk factors you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti, a company with broad international operations. like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 7 our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. we have facilities in more than 30 countries. about 85% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; shipments of products into china represent a large portion of our revenue. certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, increasing protectionism that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. this protectionism impacts our ability to deliver products and product support into china, could cause chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. we are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. in addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business. the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. for example, we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. these actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively. certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, or trade restrictions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer's inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 8 our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems. breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. these events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. from time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in item 2. properties, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner. we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. in some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed. we face supply chain and manufacturing risks. we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or health epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. in particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 9 our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. we do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property. our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a ti part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. we are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. some of these complex laws, rules and regulations for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. if our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development's base erosion and profit shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. 10 our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance. in 2019, about 65% of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. disputes with significant distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business. our margins vary. our profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. in addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. there can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. we, directly or indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. we also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. these assertions, whether or not of any merit, expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. however, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties' use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties' sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as u.s. laws. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. 11 our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws. material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk the u.s. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. our non-u.s. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars or other currencies. exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate. our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-u.s. dollar currencies. because most of the aggregate non-u.s. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2019 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-u.s. currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million. we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-u.s. dollar net balance sheet exposures. as of december 31, 2019, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $458 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $136 million to sell japanese yen, $106 million to sell indian rupees and $74 million to sell british pounds). similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2018. interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. as of december 31, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $8 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $532 million. because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. equity risk long-term investments at year-end 2019 include the following: investments in mutual funds includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. investments in venture capital funds includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities). equity investments includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10% increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. see note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 22quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information concerning market risk is contained on pages 49 and 50 of ti 2002 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated by reference to such annual report.risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual f inancial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance. semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue. the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations, and on the market price of our securities. the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key end-equipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix. in addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment. we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles. moreover, expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. as a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products. there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers, nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against dam ages resulting from infringement claims. 9 with regard to our own intellectual property, we actively enforce and protect our rights. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology. we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements. the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses. there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful. future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. additionally, consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreemen ts. a decline in demand in certain end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. our customer base includes companies in a wide range of end-user markets, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications- and computer-related industries and from sales to industrial customers. within these end-user markets, a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone, personal computer and communications infrastructure markets. decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition. our global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal, political, economic or other changes. we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide, and about 90 percent of our revenue comes from sales to locations outside the united states. operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate. any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. additionally, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers (including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments) may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 10 our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, critical manufacturing equipment, manufacturing processes and third-party manufacturing services. our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits. we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. a limited number of third parties perform these functions, and we do not have long-term contracts with all of them. reliance on these third parties involves risks, includin g possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, the third parties' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. our operations could be affected by changes in environmental, safety and health laws and regulations we are subject to environmental, safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business, particularly those in which we manufacture our products. if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business, particularly if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or ind irect use of energy, or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment, in connection with the manufacture of our products. there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available, or be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, a multi-year revolving credit agreement, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments. if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. material impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations charges associated with impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill. a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from, among other things, unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit, may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill. 11 our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls or product liability. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. costs or payments we may make in co nnection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information contained under the caption quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in our 2010 annual

risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community, and other factors beyond our control. cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance. our semiconductor business is our largest business segment and the principal source of our revenue. the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in demand. these changes could adversely affect our results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. in particular, our strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors. the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key end-equipment markets such as communications, entertainment electronics and computing grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix. in addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own most of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed. in general, these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment. we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles. moreover, expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. as a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products, that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products. 9 we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect that the level of this competition will increase in the future from large, established semiconductor and related product companies, as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets that we also serve. certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those of our products that currently offer technological and/or price advantages over competitive products. competition results in price and product development pressures, which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match price declines or technological, product, applications support, software or manufacturing advances of our competitors. our performance depends in part upon our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. we may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others. to the extent that we rely on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain all of the licenses we desire in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all. the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims. we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology. we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various license agreements. some agreements expired in 2005 and either have been or are currently being renegotiated. others will come up for renegotiation in future years. future royalty revenue depends on the strength of our portfolio and enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. additionally, the consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements. a decline in demand in certain end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computer-related industries. within these industries, a large portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the cell-phone, personal computer and communications infrastructure markets. decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition. our global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal, political, economic or other changes. we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide, and in 2005 more than 80 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states. operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as the general political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks, of the various countries in which we operate, which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations. also, as discussed in more detail on pages 59 and 60 of our 2005 annual report to stockholders, we use forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our non-u.s. dollar net balance sheet exposures. nevertheless, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we, our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural 10 disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or our customers or suppliers , may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customers demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, critical manufacturing equipment and third-party manufacturing services. our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits. we depend on a limited number of third parties to perform these functions. we do not have long-term contracts with all of these third parties. reliance on these third parties involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand. our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxation. we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls or product liability. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer. we do maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. 11 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information concerning

that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of liquid short-term investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines, which support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments. 12 our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls or product liability. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we do maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and

market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance. semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue. the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations, and on the market price of our securities. the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if these markets or key end-equipment markets such as communications, consumer electronics, computing, automotive and industrial grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our shipment volume, reductions in, or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix. in addition, the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed. in general, these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment. we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that, in turn, may result in shortened product life cycles. moreover, expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured. as a result, there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products. there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers, nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products. 9 we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets. certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. with regard to our own intellectual property, we actively enforce and protect our rights. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology. we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements. the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses. there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful. future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. additionally, consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements. a decline in demand in certain end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations. our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries, but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications- and computer-related industries. within these industries, a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone, personal computer and communications infrastructure markets. decline in one or several of these end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition. our global manufacturing, design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal, political, economic or other changes. we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide, and in 2008 more than 85 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states. operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies, as well as political and economic conditions, security risks, health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate. any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results. also, as discussed in more detail on page 47 of our 2008 annual report to stockholders, we use forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the adverse earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-u.s. dollar net balance sheet exposures. nevertheless, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate. we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations. in addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 10 the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide, the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers (including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments) may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, critical manufacturing equipment, manufacturing processes and third-party manufacturing services. our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. additionally, the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits. we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. a limited number of third parties perform these functions, and we do not have long-term contracts with all of them. reliance on these third parties involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, the third parties inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us. our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxation. we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries, or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in our business, and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. similarly, such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments. if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. 11 our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims, product recalls or product liability. we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications. in the event of a warranty claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. the information concerning market risk contained on pages 47 and 48 of ti 2008 annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. for example, the china market is highly competitive, and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share. additionally, we may face increased competition as a result of china's adoption of policies designed to promote its domestic semiconductor industry. certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. additionally, traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality, designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products. we require significant investments to develop new technologies and products that meet changing customer demands, and we might not realize a return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed. changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or grows at a significantly slower pace than management expects, our results of operations may be adversely affected. additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 9 our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer's inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume; obsolescence of our inventory; and shifts in our product mix. in addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance. semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations, and on the market price of our securities. our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. we have facilities in more than 30 countries. about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; in particular, shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue. we are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. any of these could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results. additionally, in periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business, the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition. we face supply chain and manufacturing risks. we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected if our suppliers' operations were disrupted as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources, and utilities. additionally, a breach of our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information. if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. in particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demands that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 10 our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. we do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective, and appropriate manner and the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us. our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems. breaches of our information technology systems could be caused by computer viruses, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism. these breaches could compromise our information technology networks and could result in unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information, cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations, result in release of employee personal data, or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunction from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology. moreover, the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as u.s. laws. we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements. the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees, and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses. there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful. future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts, and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees. additionally, consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue. royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable, in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements. our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. we are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. some of these complex laws, rules and regulations for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. 11 our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims , product recalls, product liability claims, or legal proceedings. we could be subject to claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs or communications that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part. in such instances, we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty, epidemic failure and delivery claims, product recalls or other legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our reputation. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. if our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits; changes in applicable tax rates; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. we have not made a provision for u.s. income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings, we might incur incremental u.s. income tax, which could affect our results of operations. our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance. in 2015, about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described under item 1a, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. 12 our results of operations an d liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing, management and staff personnel. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require. our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. from time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. for example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition. further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill. a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from, among other things, unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit, may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill. most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti, a company with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. for example, we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. these actions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. additionally, traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality, designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products. we make significant investments in research and development to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands, and we might not realize a return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed. changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or grows at a significantly slower pace than management expects, our results of operations may be adversely affected. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand. additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including 9 curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, may adversely affect our results of operations and fi nancial condition. our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer's inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. we have facilities in more than 30 countries. about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; in particular, shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue. we are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate, including the united states. additionally, certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, increasing protectionism that may impact global trade. this could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results. in addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business. the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition. our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems. breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could be caused by computer viruses, system failures, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism or terrorism. these events could compromise our information technology networks; result in lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of employee personal data; or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. we face supply chain and manufacturing risks. we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources, and utilities. additionally, a breach of our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information. if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. in particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 10 our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our p roducts, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. we do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. reliance on these suppliers in volves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective, and appropriate manner and the possibility of supplie rs' imposition of increased costs on us. our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. we are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; and intellectual property ownership and infringement. compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. some of these complex laws, rules and regulations for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. we could be subject to claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs or communications that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our reputation. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. if our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. a number of factors could cause our taxes to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. we have not made a provision for u.s. income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states. if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings, we might incur incremental u.s. income tax, which could affect our results of operations. 11 our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our in ventory. we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance. in 2016, about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. disputes with or the loss of a significant number of distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our current business. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume; obsolescence of our inventory; shifts in our product mix; and changes in tariffs. in addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio. there can be no assurance that, as our business expands into new areas, we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. we may, directly or indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. these assertions, whether or not of any merit, could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. however, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology, including, for example, third parties' use of our patented technology in their products without the right to do so or third parties' sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. moreover, the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as u.s. laws. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including the other risk factors described under item 1a, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. 12 increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel. skilled and experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws. our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. from time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. for example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition. further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. foreign exchange risk the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. our non-u.s. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars or other currencies. exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently on our effective tax rate. 23 our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-u.s. dollar currencies. because most of the aggregate non-u.s. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2016 balances and currency exchang e rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-u.s. currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of about $1 million. we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-u.s. dollar net balance sheet exposures. for example, at year-end 2016, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $494 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $158 million to sell japanese yen and $123 million to sell euros). similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2015. interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. as of december 31, 2016, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $7 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $104 million. because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. equity risk long-term investments at year-end 2016 include the following: investments in mutual funds includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. investments in venture capital funds includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method). equity investments includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost. impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in net income. investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. see note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 24risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti, a company with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. for example, we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. these actions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. additionally, traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality, designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer's inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 9 our global operations subject us to risks associate d with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. we have facilities in more than 30 countries. about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; in particular, shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue. we are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate, including the united states. additionally, certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, increasing protectionism that may impact global trade. this could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results. in addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business. the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches or disruptions of information technology systems. breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. these events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation or penalties, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. cybersecurity threats are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition. rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner. we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products and develop new ones to meet changing customer demands. in some cases, we might not realize a return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed. we face supply chain and manufacturing risks. we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. additionally, a breach of our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information. if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. in particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 10 our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assem bly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. we do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. relian ce on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective, and appropriate manner and th e possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us. our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. we are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. some of these complex laws, rules and regulations for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. we could be subject to claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and our reputation. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. if our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development's base erosion and profit shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax liability will change. our initial estimates of the financial impact of the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act, enacted in december 2017, may change as we refine our analysis and as additional guidance becomes available. if in the future we repatriate any of the earnings represented by non-cash, operating assets such as inventory and fixed assets, we might incur incremental non-u.s. taxes, which could affect our results of operations. 11 our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance. in 2017, about 65 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. disputes with or the loss of a significant number of distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our current business. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume; obsolescence of our inventory; shifts in our product mix; changes in tariffs; changes in our manufacturing processes; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. in addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. there can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. we may, directly or indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. we may also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. these assertions, whether or not of any merit, could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. however, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties' use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties' sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as u.s. laws. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. 12 our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel. skilled and experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws. our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. from time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. for example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition. further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations . quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. foreign exchange risk the u.s. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting. our non-u.s. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars or other currencies. exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently on our effective tax rate. our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-u.s. dollar currencies. because most of the aggregate non-u.s. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2017 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-u.s. currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of about $6 million. we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-u.s. dollar net balance sheet exposures. for example, at year-end 2017, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $365 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $140 million to sell japanese yen, $59 million to sell british pound sterling and $49 million to sell euros). similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2016. interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. as of december 31, 2017, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by $8 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $141 million. because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. equity risk long-term investments at year-end 2017 include the following: investments in mutual funds includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. investments in venture capital funds includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity or cost method). equity investments includes non- marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. non-marketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost. impairments deemed to be other-than-temporary are expensed in net income. investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. see note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 24risk factors. you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission (sec) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti, a company with broad international operations. like other companies, we are susceptible to any potential downturn associated with increasing protectionism, trade tensions and macroeconomic weakness , including any potential downturn associated with the pending withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union. these may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do n ot meet our and/or the investment community's expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community's expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. for example, we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. these actions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies. certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. additionally, traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality, designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products. the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer's inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter's revenue forecast. in addition, when responding to customers' requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers' demands. these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. if we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 8 our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. we have facilities in more than 30 countries. about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states; in particular, shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue. we are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. additionally, certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, increasing protectionism that may impact global trade, including tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. this could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results. in addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the u.s. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-u.s. currencies in which we transact business. the remeasurement of non-u.s. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches or disruptions of information technology systems. breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. these events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers' or our suppliers' confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. cybersecurity threats are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. we have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations. a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition. rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner. we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. in some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed. we face supply chain and manufacturing risks. we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers' operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. additionally, a breach of our suppliers' information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information. if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. in particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 9 our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. we subcontract a po rtion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. we do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number o f alternate suppliers is limited. reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers' inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective, and appropriate manner and the possibility of suppliers' imposition of increased costs on us. our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. in the event of a claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. we maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. in addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a ti part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. we are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. some of these complex laws, rules and regulations for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. if our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. in addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development's base erosion and profit shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. if that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. if in the future we repatriate any of our earnings represented by non-cash, operating assets such as inventory and fixed assets, we might incur incremental non-u.s. taxes, which could affect our results of operations. 10 our results of operations and financial condition could be advers ely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ti-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors' promotion of competing product lines or our distributors' financial performance. in 2018, about 65 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. disputes with or the loss of significant distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our current business. our margins may vary over time. our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume; obsolescence of our inventory; shifts in our product mix; changes in tariffs; changes in our manufacturing processes; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. in addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. in general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. there can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. we may, directly or indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. we may also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. these assertions, whether or not of any merit, could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. however, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties' use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties' sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as u.s. laws. our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. from time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. in addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. 11 our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. we maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans' actual experience differs from these assumptions. our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws. our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. from time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. for example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition. further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. foreign exchange risk the u.s. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. our non-u.s. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in u.s. dollars or other currencies. exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently impact our effective tax rate. our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-u.s. dollar currencies. because most of the aggregate non-u.s. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2018 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-u.s. currency exchange rates relative to the u.s. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of about $3 million. we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-u.s. dollar net balance sheet exposures. for example, at year-end 2018, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $525 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $160 million to sell japanese yen, $99 million to sell euros and $94 million to sell indian rupees). similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2017. interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. as of december 31, 2018, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $4 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $330 million. because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. equity risk long-term investments at year-end 2018 include the following: investments in mutual funds includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. investments in venture capital funds includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities). equity investments includes non- marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments' fair values would not materially affect operating results. non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. see note 7 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 23
