to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors described below under risk factors and in qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk . these factors include, without limitation: our ability to manage our growth effectively; our ability to maintain effective internal controls; increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share; changes in consumer preferences or the reduction in demand for performance apparel and other products; 9 our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products; reduced demand for sporting goods and apparel generally; failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner; our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to effectively market and maintain a positive brand image; the availability and effective operation of management information systems and other technology; our ability to attract and maintain the services of our senior management and key employees; and changes in general economic or market conditions, including as a result of political or military unrest or terrorist attacks. the forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-k reflect our views and

or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to manage that growth effectively and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $281.1 million in 2005 from $19.7 million in 2001. our substantial growth has placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources. if our operations continue to grow, we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions and to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology as well as obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, and delays in production and shipments. these difficulties would likely result in the erosion of our brand image and a resulting decrease in net revenues, net income and the price of our class a common stock. we are exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards. we completed our initial public offering in 2005. we are spending a significant amount of management time and external resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ( sox ), new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules. our management team has limited experience operating a public reporting company. as a result, we will likely need to continue to improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. section 404 of sox requires management annual review and evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these controls by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm. we are required by section 404 to be compliant by december 31, 2006. we believe adequate resources and expertise, both internal and external have been put in place to meet this 10 requirement. we intend to work closely with our independent registered public accounting firm during this process. though we have taken efforts to become sox compliant by the end of 2006, there is no guarantee that it will result in management assurance or an attestation by the independent auditors that internal controls over financial reporting are adequate. in the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our controls over financial reporting are not effective as required by section 404 of sox, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and, among other things, this could cause a decline in the price of our class a common stock. in addition, our overhead may increase and our net income may decline as a percentage of net revenues as a result of the additional costs associated with complying with the complex legal regime associated with being a public reporting company. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our gross margin declines and we fail to sufficiently reduce our cost of goods sold or grow our net revenues, our profitability will decline, and we could incur operating losses that we may be unable to fund or sustain for extended periods of time, if at all. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition and could result in a decline in the price of our class a common stock. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2005, approximately 36% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers, dick sporting goods and the sports authority. the percentage of our net revenues attributable to these customers has increased in recent years as these customers opened new store locations and devoted an increased portion of their floor space to our products. we expect this trend to continue in 2006. however, we do not enter into long-term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe that continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives, such as basic cotton t-shirts, to performance products. if consumers are not convinced that performance products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced that performance products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced that they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer 11 acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. there can be no assurance that we will respond to changing preferences in a timely manner. failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative products, and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in addition, there can be no assurance that our strategy of continuing to expand the range of performance products that we offer into new product categories will be well received by consumers or will not dilute our brand image and result in a shift of consumer preferences away from our product lines. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and result in a decline in the price of our class a common stock. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and our financial condition. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market would be adversely affected. we rely on our distribution facility in glen burnie, maryland, which became fully operational in july 2004, for substantially all of our product distribution. our distribution facility includes computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because substantially all of our products are distributed from one location, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facility. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facility, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facility. if we encounter problems with our distribution facility, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2005, three manufacturers produced over 35% of our products. we have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative 12 suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term. in addition, there can be no assurance that our suppliers and manufacturers will continue to provide fabrics and raw materials and to manufacture products that are consistent with our standards. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace. the cost of raw materials could affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum-based products. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials may materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition, and cause a decline in the price of our class a common stock. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. the use of our products by athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. we also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel to a variety of sports leagues and olympic teams. however, as competition in the performance apparel industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have risen dramatically, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. there is no assurance that we will be able to retain existing or attract new athletes or sports programs to wear or endorse our products or retain official supplier agreements at a reasonable cost, or at all. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products and may be required to modify and substantially increase the cost of our marketing plan. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and gross profit. the market for active sports apparel is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance 13 products. because we currently own no fabric or process patents or copyrights, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and sporting goods companies with strong worldwide brand recognition, such as nike and adidas that have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor and tactical apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger sales forces, bigger advertising budgets, better brand recognition among consumers, greater economies of scale and long-term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while a component of one of our key growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited resources and floor space and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross profit margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to minimize purchasing costs and ensure supply, we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least 90-120 days prior to the time we need to deliver our products. however, we generally do not receive firm customer orders prior to 30 days before the date those orders are to be shipped. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our peak season from august through november. because we place orders for products with our manufacturers before our customers orders are firm and because we receive a significant volume of at-once orders, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for products of our competitors; our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products; new product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; 14 weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand in order to meet future order and reorder requirements. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products is likely to result in an unexpected adverse effect on our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear line. approximately 62% and 66% of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters of 2005 and 2004, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western u.s. ports in 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. the value of our brand, and sales of our products, could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require that our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other 15 standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image and result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity and the price of our class a common stock. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource system and our warehouse management system, both of which were purchased from third parties and implemented in 2002. since then, we have updated and supplemented these systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, including difficulties with the operation or implementation of our new enterprise resource system software that is scheduled to become operational during 2006, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. we cannot assure you that such events will not occur. our international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2005, our products were manufactured by 18 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries. in 2005, approximately 50% of our products were manufactured in central and south america, with 43% in asia and 7% manufactured in the united states. in addition, approximately 5% of our 2005 net revenues were generated through international sales and licensing fees. as a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the united states; complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located. 16 these and other factors beyond our control could interrupt our manufacturers production in offshore facilities, influence the ability of our manufacturers to export our products cost-effectively or at all, inhibit our and our unaffiliated manufacturers ability to procure certain materials, increase our legal or compliance costs and influence our ability to sell our products in international markets, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations. risks related to our management our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, technical, sales and client support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management and product design teams. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. with new additions to our senior management we may develop and implement changes in our product development, merchandising, marketing and operational strategies. there can be no assurance that we would successfully assimilate new senior management and make strategic modifications to our past operating policies in a timely and efficient manner, and if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain additional senior management with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. risks related to proprietary rights our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented or copyrighted and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are owned or controlled by our suppliers, except as noted below, and are generally not unique to us. as a result, our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents or copyrights, except for a pending patent application for performance sports garments formed from single-layer, double-faced performance warp knit fabric that includes kevin plank as a co-inventor. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors, such as nike, adidas and reebok, have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. 17 our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.risk factors 8 risk factors forward-looking statements some of the statements contained in this form 10-k and the documents incorporated herein

consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to manage that growth effectively and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $430.7 million in 2006 from $49.6 million in 2002. our substantial growth could place a significant strain on our management systems and resources. if our operations continue to grow, we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions and to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology as well as obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, and delays in production and shipments. these difficulties would likely result in the erosion of our brand image and a resulting decrease in net revenues and net income. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning system, or erp, which we implemented in the second quarter of 2006. the failure of this system to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of this system could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. we cannot assure you that such events will not occur. 9 table of contents our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our gross margin declines and we fail to sufficiently reduce our cost of goods sold or grow our net revenues, our profitability will decline, and we could incur operating losses that we may be unable to fund or sustain for extended periods of time, if at all. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2006, approximately 37% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers in alphabetical order, dick sporting goods and the sports authority. the percentage of our net revenues attributable to these customers has increased in recent years as these customers opened new store locations and devoted an increased portion of their floor space to our products. we expect this trend to continue in 2007. however, we currently do not enter into long-term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. we are incurring increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulation of corporate governance and disclosure standards. we completed our initial public offering in november 2005. we have spent and continue to spend a significant amount of management time and external resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ( sox ), new sec regulations and stock exchange rules. our management team has limited experience operating a public reporting company. as a result, we will likely need to continue to improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. section 404 of sox requires management annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these controls by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm. we completed our first section 404 report in early 2007. we expect to continue to enhance our internal controls. however, there is no guarantee that these efforts will result in management assurance or an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that internal control over financial reporting is adequate in future periods. in the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our control over financial reporting are not effective as required by section 404 of sox, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected. in addition, our overhead may increase and our net income may decline as a percentage of net revenues as a result of the additional costs associated with complying with the complex legal regime associated with being a public reporting company. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe that continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives, such as basic cotton t-shirts, to performance products. if consumers are not convinced that performance products are a better choice than traditional 10 table of contents alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced that performance products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced that they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. there can be no assurance that we will respond to changing preferences in a timely manner. failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products, and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in addition, there can be no assurance that our strategy of continuing to expand the range of performance products that we offer into new product categories will be well received by consumers or will not dilute our brand image and result in a shift of consumer preferences away from our product lines. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and our financial condition. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market would be adversely affected. we rely on our distribution facility in glen burnie, maryland for the majority of our product distribution, and in the second quarter of 2007 we expect a second distribution facility, also in glen burnie, maryland to be operational. our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because the majority of our products are distributed from two nearby locations, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. 11 table of contents we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2006, four manufacturers produced approximately 50% of our products. we have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. in addition, there can be no assurance that our suppliers and manufacturers will continue to provide fabrics and raw materials and to manufacture products that are consistent with our standards. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our reputation in the marketplace. the cost of raw materials could affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum-based products. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials may materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. the use of our products by athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. we also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports leagues at the collegiate and professional level as well as olympic teams. however, as competition in the performance apparel industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have risen dramatically, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. there is no assurance that we will be able to retain existing or attract new athletes or sports programs to wear or endorse our products or retain official supplier agreements at a reasonable cost, or at all. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate 12 table of contents athletes, teams and leagues, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products and may be required to modify and substantially increase the cost of our marketing plan. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and gross profit. the market for active sports apparel and footwear is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we currently own no fabric or process patents or copyrights, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition, such as nike and adidas that have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor and tactical apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger sales forces, bigger advertising budgets, better brand recognition among consumers, greater economies of scale and long-term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while a component of one of our key growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited resources and floor space and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross profit margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to minimize purchasing costs and ensure supply, we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least 90-120 days prior to the time we need to deliver our products. however, we generally do not receive firm customer orders prior to 21 days before the date those orders are to be shipped. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our peak season from august through november. because we place orders for products with our manufacturers before our customers orders are firm and because we receive a significant volume of at-once orders, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. 13 table of contents factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for products of our competitors; our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand in order to meet future order and reorder requirements. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products is likely to result in an unexpected adverse effect on our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear &reg; line. approximately 61% and 62% of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters of 2006 and 2005, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear &reg; line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western u.s. ports in 14 table of contents 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. the value of our brand, and sales of our products, could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require that our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image and result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. our international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2006, our apparel products were manufactured by 18 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries, four of which manufactured approximately 50% of our products. these four manufacturers are located in mexico, china and colombia. in 2006, approximately 40% of our products were manufactured in asia, with 32% manufactured in central and south america and 24% manufactured in mexico. in addition, approximately 4% of our 2006 net revenues were generated through international sales and licensing fees. as a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the united states; complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located. our senior secured credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our senior secured credit facility. the senior secured credit facility is a revolving facility of up to $100.0 million (based on the value of our accounts receivable and inventory). 15 table of contents our senior secured credit facility contains a number of significant restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; pay dividends on stock or redeem or acquire any of our securities; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guaranty certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and engage in any activity materially different from those presently conducted by us. the facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the valuation of our inventory and receivables and thereby reduce our ability to borrow under the facility even if we are in compliance with all of the conditions of the facility. in addition, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants in the event we fail to maintain a minimum borrowing availability. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic changes. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under our senior secured credit facility could result in a default under the facility. this could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because our senior secured credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. risks related to our management our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, technical, sales and client support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management and product design teams. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. with new additions to our senior management we may develop and implement changes in our product development, merchandising, marketing and operational strategies. there can be no assurance that we would successfully assimilate new senior management and make strategic modifications to our past operating policies in a timely and efficient manner, and if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain additional senior management with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. 16 table of contents risks related to proprietary rights our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented or copyrighted and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers, except as noted below, and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents or copyrights. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors, such as nike and adidas, have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. 17 table of contents quantitative

conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to manage that growth effectively and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $606.6 million in 2007 from $115.4 million in 2003. continued rapid growth could place a significant strain on our management systems and resources. if our operations continue to grow, we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems, other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, and delays in production and shipments. in addition, as we introduce more new products, such as footwear, and expand internationally, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties would likely result in the erosion of our brand image and a resulting decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. there can be no assurance that we will respond to changing preferences in a timely manner. failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products, and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in addition, there can be no assurance that our strategy of continuing to expand the range of performance athletic products that we offer into new product categories will be well received by consumers or will not dilute our brand image and result in a shift of consumer preferences away from our product lines. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to minimize purchasing costs and ensure supply, we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least 90-120 days prior to the time we need to deliver our products. however, we generally do not receive firm customer orders prior to 21 days before the date those orders are to be shipped. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our peak season from august through november. because we place orders for products with our manufacturers before our customers orders are firm and because we receive a significant volume of at-once orders, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. 11 table of contents factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for products of our competitors; our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand in order to meet future order and reorder requirements. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products is likely to result in an unexpected adverse effect on our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and gross profit. the market for performance athletic apparel and footwear is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we currently own no fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition, such as nike and adidas, which have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger sales forces, bigger advertising budgets, better brand recognition among consumers, greater economies of scale and long-term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. 12 table of contents in addition, while a component of one of our key growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited resources and floor space and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. we cannot assure you that such events will not occur. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our gross margin declines and we fail to sufficiently reduce our cost of goods sold or grow our net revenues, our profitability will decline, and we could incur operating losses that we may be unable to fund or sustain for extended periods of time, if at all. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2007, approximately 33% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers in alphabetical order, dick sporting goods and the sports authority. we currently do not enter into long-term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. sales of performance athletic products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe that continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance athletic products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives, such as basic cotton t-shirts, to performance athletic products. if consumers are not convinced that these athletic products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance athletic products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced that these athletic products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced that they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance athletic products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. 13 table of contents if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility and our financial condition. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market would be adversely affected. we rely on our two distribution facilities in glen burnie, maryland for the majority of our product distribution. our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because the majority of our products are distributed from two nearby locations, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2007, seven manufacturers produced approximately 55% of our products. we have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. in addition, there can be no assurance that our suppliers and manufacturers will continue to provide fabrics and raw materials and to manufacture products that are consistent with our standards. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality 14 table of contents control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. fluctuations in the cost of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum-based products. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. the use of our products by athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. we also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level as well as olympic teams. however, as competition in the performance apparel industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have risen dramatically, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. there is no assurance that we will be able to retain existing or attract new athletes or sports programs to wear or endorse our products or retain official supplier agreements at a reasonable cost, or at all. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products and may be required to modify and substantially increase the cost of our marketing plan. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. we face ongoing costs and risks associated with complying with extensive corporate governance and disclosure standards. we have spent and continue to spend a significant amount of management time and resources to comply with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ( sox ), sec regulations and stock exchange rules. section 404 of sox requires management annual review and evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestations of the effectiveness of these controls by our management and by our independent registered public accounting firm. in early 2007, we completed our first section 404 report for fiscal year 2006. we expect to continue to enhance our internal controls as our business grows. however, there is no guarantee that these efforts will result in management assurance or an attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm that internal control over financial reporting is adequate in future periods. in the event that our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as required by section 404 of sox, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected. in addition, our overhead may increase and our net income may decline as a percentage of net revenues as a result of the additional costs associated with complying with the complex legal regime associated with being a public reporting company. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced 15 table of contents coldgear &reg; line. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters of 2007 and 2006, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear &reg; line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western u.s. ports in 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require that our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image and result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. our international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2007, our apparel and footwear products were manufactured by 19 primary manufacturers, operating in 15 countries, seven of which manufactured approximately 55% of our products. these manufacturers are primarily located in china, dominican republic, honduras and mexico. in 2007, approximately 53% of our products were manufactured in asia, with 25% manufactured in central and south america and 19% manufactured in mexico. in addition, approximately 7% of our 2007 net revenues were generated through 16 table of contents international sales and licensing fees. as a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the united states; complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located. our senior secured credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our senior secured credit facility. the senior secured credit facility is a revolving facility of up to $100.0 million (based on the value of our eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory). our senior secured credit facility contains a number of significant restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; pay dividends on stock or redeem or acquire any of our securities; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guaranty certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and engage in any activity materially different from those presently conducted by us. the facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the valuation of our inventory and receivables in certain circumstances and thereby reduce our ability to borrow under the facility even if we are in compliance with all of the conditions of the facility. in addition, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants in the event we fail to maintain a minimum borrowing availability. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic changes. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under our senior secured credit facility could result in a default under the facility. this could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because our senior secured credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. 17 table of contents our chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock has 10 votes per share. our chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all 12.5 million shares outstanding of class b convertible common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration of ownership may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. risks related to our management our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, technical, sales and customer support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management and product design teams. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. with new additions to our senior management we may develop and implement changes in our product development, merchandising, marketing and operational strategies. there can be no assurance that we would successfully assimilate new senior management and make strategic modifications to our past operating policies in a timely and efficient manner, and if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain additional senior management with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. risks related to proprietary rights our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors, such as nike and adidas, have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. 18 table of contents our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk under

our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands; our ability to obtain the financing required to grow our business, particularly when credit and capital markets are unstable; increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share; changes in consumer preferences or the reduction in demand for performance apparel and other products; reduced demand for sporting goods and apparel generally; loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner; our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to

should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower. due to our limited operating history, we have not experienced a recessionary period and can therefore not predict the effect of a downturn in the economy on our sales and profitability. however, a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2008, approximately 31% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers in alphabetical order, dick sporting goods and the sports authority. we currently do not enter into long-term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to manage that growth effectively and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $725.2 million in 2008 from $205.2 million in 2004. if our operations continue to grow, we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, and delays in production and shipments. in addition, as we introduce more new products, such as new footwear, and expand internationally, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties would likely result in the erosion of our brand image and a resulting decrease in net revenues and net income. 11 table of contents if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. there can be no assurance that we will respond to changing preferences in a timely manner. failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products, and there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. in addition, there can be no assurance that our strategy of continuing to expand the range of performance athletic products that we offer into new product categories will be well received by consumers or will not dilute our brand image and result in a shift of consumer preferences away from our product lines. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to minimize purchasing costs and ensure supply, we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least 90-150 days prior to the time we need to deliver our products. however, we generally do not receive firm customer orders prior to 21 days before the date those orders are to be shipped. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season from august through november. because we place orders for products with our manufacturers before our customers orders are firm and because we receive a significant volume of at-once orders, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for products of our competitors; our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage inventory demand in order to meet future order and reorder requirements. 12 table of contents the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products is likely to result in an unexpected adverse effect on our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our revolving credit facility. we entered into a new revolving credit facility in january 2009. the new revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $200.0 million (based on the value of our qualified domestic accounts receivable and inventory). similar to the prior revolving credit facility, the agreement for our new revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; incur additional indebtedness; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guaranty certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and materially change our line of business. the new revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of this revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we must not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 2.5 and must not fall below a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 as defined in this credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under this credit agreement could result in a default. this could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse 13 table of contents effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and gross profit. the market for performance athletic apparel and footwear is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we currently own no fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition, such as nike and adidas, which have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do. because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger sales forces, bigger advertising budgets, better brand recognition among consumers, greater economies of scale and long-term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while a component of one of our key growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited resources and floor space and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our gross margin to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. if our gross margin declines and we fail to sufficiently reduce our cost of goods sold or grow our net revenues, our profitability will decline, and we could incur operating losses that we may be unable to fund or sustain for extended periods of time, if at all. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 14 table of contents sales of performance athletic products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe that continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance athletic products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives, such as basic cotton t-shirts, to performance athletic products. if consumers are not convinced that these athletic products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance athletic products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced that these athletic products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced that they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance athletic products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2008, eight manufacturers produced approximately 55% of our products. we have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace an existing manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. in addition, there can be no assurance that our suppliers and manufacturers will continue to provide fabrics and raw materials and to manufacture products that are consistent with our standards. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western u.s. ports in 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. 15 table of contents our international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2008, our apparel and footwear were manufactured by 23 primary manufacturers, operating in 12 countries, eight of which manufactured approximately 55% of our products. these manufacturers are primarily located in china, dominican republic, honduras, mexico and nicaragua. in 2008, approximately 59% of our products were manufactured in asia, with 18% manufactured in central and south america and 18% manufactured in mexico. in addition, approximately 9% of our 2008 net revenues were generated through international sales and licensing fees. as a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the united states; complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located. fluctuations in the cost of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum-based products. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear &reg; line. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear &reg; line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. 16 table of contents the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require that our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues could also harm our brand image and result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. the use of our products by athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. we also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level as well as olympic teams. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have risen dramatically, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. there is no assurance that we will be able to retain existing or attract new athletes or sports programs to wear or endorse our products or retain official supplier agreements at a reasonable cost, or at all. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products and may be required to modify and substantially increase the cost of our marketing plan. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market would be adversely affected. we rely on our two distribution facilities in glen burnie, maryland for the majority of our product distribution. our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because the majority of our products are distributed from two nearby locations, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. 17 table of contents we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. we cannot assure you that such events will not occur. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, or ftc, consumer product safety commission, or cpsc, and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our failure to comply with ftc, cpsc or state regulations, or with regulations in foreign markets that cover our product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise harm the distribution and sale of our products. our chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock has 10 votes per share. our chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all 12.5 million shares outstanding of class b convertible common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration of ownership may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. risks related to our management our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, technical, sales and customer support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management and product design teams. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to 18 table of contents attract, retain and motivate highly talented employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. with new additions to our senior management we may develop and implement changes in our product development, merchandising, marketing and operational strategies. there can be no assurance that we would successfully assimilate new senior management and make strategic modifications to our past operating policies in a timely and efficient manner, and if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain additional senior management with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. risks related to proprietary rights our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors, such as nike and adidas, have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. we cannot assure you that obstacles will not arise as we expand our product line and the geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. 19 table of contents from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market

footwear; our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands; our ability to obtain the financing required to grow our business, particularly when credit and capital markets are unstable or tighten; increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share; loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner;

consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower. we have limited experience operating a business during a recessionary period and can therefore not predict the full impact of a downturn in the economy on our sales and profitability, including how our business responds when the economy is recovering from a recession. however, a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2009, approximately 30% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers in alphabetical order, dick sporting goods and the sports authority. we currently do not enter into long-term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $856.4 million in 2009 from $281.1 million in 2005. if our operations continue to grow, we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees, difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, and delays in production and shipments. in addition, as our business becomes more complex through the introduction of more new products, such as new footwear, and the expansion of our distribution 11 table of contents channels, including additional factory house outlet and specialty stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and a resulting decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season from august through november. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. 12 table of contents we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under a revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $200.0 million (based on the value of our qualified domestic accounts receivable and inventory). the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; incur additional indebtedness; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guarantee certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and materially change our line of business. our revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we must not exceed a maximum leverage ratio of 2.5 and must not fall below a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. this could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenues and gross profit. the market for performance athletic apparel and footwear is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and 13 table of contents marketing of performance products. because we currently do not own any fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long-term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited resources and floor space and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2009, eight manufacturers produced approximately 55% of our products. we have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a 14 table of contents timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long-term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western u.s. ports in 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2009, our apparel and footwear were manufactured by 22 primary manufacturers, operating in 17 countries. of these, eight manufactured approximately 55% of our products, at locations in cambodia, china, the dominican republic, honduras, mexico, nicaragua and the philippines. in 2009, approximately 60% of our products were manufactured in asia, 18% in central and south america and 17% in mexico. in addition, approximately 10% of our 2009 net revenues were generated through international sales and licensing fees. as a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, as well as trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the united states; complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located. 15 table of contents sales of performance athletic products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe that continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance athletic products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance athletic products. if consumers are not convinced that these athletic products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance athletic products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced that these athletic products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced that they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance athletic products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. fluctuations in the cost of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum-based products. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear &reg; line. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear &reg; line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require that our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. 16 table of contents sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. the use of our products by athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. we also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level as well as olympic teams. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on our two distribution facilities in glen burnie, maryland for the majority of our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because the majority of our products are distributed from two nearby locations, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. 17 table of contents we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock has 10 votes per share. our chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all 12.5 million shares outstanding of class b convertible common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration of ownership may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. there may be obstacles that arise as we 18 table of contents expand our product line and the geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others, and we expect that third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange and foreign currency risk management and derivatives we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe. the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. to date, net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant. however, as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, if we recognize international revenues in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in canada and europe) and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our international revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in 41 table of contents addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our international subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by inter-company transactions. these exposures are included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income. since 2007, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inter-company transactions and projected inventory purchases for our canadian subsidiary. beginning in december 2008, we began using foreign currency forward contracts in order to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on inter-company transactions for our european subsidiary. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2009, we receive us dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of 1.04 cad per $1.00 and us dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.70 eur per $1.00. as of december 31, 2009, the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our canadian subsidiary was $15.4 million with contract maturities of 1 month, and the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our european subsidiary was $56.0 million with contract maturities of 1 month. the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income. the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was $0.3 million and $1.2 million as of december 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. these amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 for a discussion of the fair value measurements. other income (expense), net included the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2009 2008 2007 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ 5,222 $ (5,459 ) $ 2,567 realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) (261 ) (2,166 ) 174 unrealized derivative gains (losses) (1,060 ) 1,650 (243 ) realized derivative losses (4,412 ) (204 ) (469 ) although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 42 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors forward-looking statements some of the statements contained in this form 10-k and the documents incorporated

in general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers; our ability to effectively manage our growth and a more complex business; our ability to effectively develop and launch new, innovative and updated products; our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands; increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share; fluctuations in the costs of our products; loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner; changes in consumer preferences or the reduction in demand for performance apparel, footwear and other products; our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our operating

of unanticipated events. 10 table of contents our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower. we have limited experience operating a business during a recessionary period and can therefore not predict the full impact of a downturn in the economy on our sales and profitability, including how our business responds when the economy is recovering from a recession. a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2010, approximately 27% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers in alphabetical order, dick sporting goods and the sports authority. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of our business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $1,063.9 million in 2010 from $430.7 million in 2006. if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties 11 table of contents in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees. in addition, as our business becomes more complex through the introduction of more new products, such as new footwear, and the expansion of our distribution channels, including additional specialty and factory house stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season from august through november. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. 12 table of contents the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under a revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $200.0 million (based on the value of our qualified domestic accounts receivable and inventory). the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; incur additional indebtedness; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guarantee certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and materially change our line of business. our revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. this could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2010. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be 13 table of contents required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance athletic apparel and footwear is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we currently do not own any fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited resources and floor space and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and, beginning in 2011, cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. 14 table of contents we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2010, six manufacturers produced approximately 45% of our products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western u.s. ports in 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2010, our apparel and footwear were manufactured by 26 primary manufacturers, operating in 22 countries. of these, six manufactured approximately 45% of our products, at locations in honduras, jordan, malaysia, mexico, nicaragua, philippines, taiwan and vietnam. in 2010, approximately 55% of our products were manufactured in asia, 25% in central and south america, 10% in mexico and 5% in the middle east. in addition, approximately 6% of our 2010 net revenues were generated through sales and licensing fees in other foreign countries. as a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; 15 table of contents currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the united states; complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located. sales of performance athletic products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance athletic products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance athletic products. if consumers are not convinced these athletic products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance athletic products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these athletic products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance athletic products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear &reg; line. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing and introduction of advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear &reg; line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other 16 table of contents standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. the use of our products by athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. we also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level as well as olympic teams. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on our two distribution facilities in glen burnie, maryland for the majority of our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because the majority of our products are distributed from two nearby locations, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to 17 table of contents integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, president and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our president and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock has 10 votes per share. our president and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b convertible common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration of ownership may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent 18 table of contents protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. there may be obstacles that arise as we expand our product line and geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange and foreign currency risk management and derivatives we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe. the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. to date, net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant. however, as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, if we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in canada and europe) and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by inter-company transactions. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. 41 table of contents when deemed necessary, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inter-company transactions and projected inventory purchases for our european and canadian subsidiaries. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2010, we receive us dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of 1.00 cad per $1.00 and us dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.76 eur per $1.00. as of december 31, 2010, the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our canadian subsidiary was $17.6 million with contract maturities of 1 month, and the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our european subsidiary was $34.8 million with contract maturities of 1 month. the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were liabilities of $0.6 million as of december 31, 2010, and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $0.3 million as of december 31, 2009, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2010 2009 2008 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ (1,280 ) $ 5,222 $ (5,459 ) realized foreign currency exchange rate losses (2,638 ) (261 ) (2,166 ) unrealized derivative gains (losses) (809 ) (1,060 ) 1,650 realized derivative gains (losses) 3,549 (4,412 ) (204 ) although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 42 table of contentsrisk factors 9 risk factors forward-looking statements some of the statements contained in this form 10-k and the documents incorporated

in general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers; our ability to effectively manage our growth and a more complex, global business; our ability to effectively develop and launch new, innovative and updated products; our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands; increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share; fluctuations in the costs of our products; loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner; our ability to further expand our business globally and to drive brand awareness and consumer acceptance of our products in other countries; our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results; our ability to effectively market and maintain a positive brand image; the availability, integration and effective operation of management information systems

the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty. we have limited experience operating a business during a recessionary period or during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment and can therefore not predict the full impact of a downturn in the economy on our sales and profitability, including how our business responds when the economy is recovering from a recession or periods of slow growth. a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2011, approximately 26% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers in alphabetical order, dick sporting goods and the sports authority. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $1,472.7 million in 2011 from $606.6 million in 2007. if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees. in addition, as our business becomes more 10 table of contents complex through the introduction of more new products, such as new footwear, and the expansion of our distribution channels, including additional specialty and factory house stores and expanded distribution in malls and department stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. in addition, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season from august through november. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. 11 table of contents inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we currently do not own any fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which 12 table of contents could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2011, seven manufacturers produced approximately 45% of our products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of the north america. during the year ended december 31, 2011, 94% of our net revenues were earned in north america. we have limited experience 13 table of contents with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2011, our products were manufactured by 23 primary manufacturers, operating in 16 countries. of these, seven manufactured approximately 45% of our products, at locations in cambodia, china, honduras, indonesia, jordan, mexico, nicaragua, the philippines, vietnam and san salvador. during 2011, approximately 60% of our products were manufactured in asia, 22% in central and south america, 8% in mexico and 8% in the middle east. as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under a revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $300.0 million. the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; 14 table of contents incur additional indebtedness; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guarantee certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and materially change our line of business. our revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. a default under the credit agreement could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2011. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear &reg; line. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing and introduction of advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of 15 table of contents operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear &reg; line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because the majority of our products are distributed from two nearby locations in maryland, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third 16 table of contents parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers or employees personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. in addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as recent investments in our direct to consumer sales channel or our recent minority investment in our japanese licensee. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, president and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. 17 table of contents if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our president and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock has 10 votes per share. our president and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b convertible common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration of ownership may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. there may be obstacles that arise as we expand our product line and geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any 18 table of contents claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange and foreign currency risk management and derivatives we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe. the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. to date, net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant. however, as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, if we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in canada and europe) and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. 43 table of contents from time to time, we may elect to use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our european and canadian subsidiaries. in addition, we may elect to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on pound sterling denominated balance sheet items. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2011, we receive u.s. dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of 1.03 cad per $1.00, u.s. dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.77 per $1.00 and euros in exchange for pounds sterling at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of &pound;0.84 per 1.00. as of december 31, 2011, the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our canadian subsidiary was $51.1 million with contract maturities of 1 month or less, and the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our european subsidiary was $50.0 million with contract maturities of 1 month. as of december 31, 2011, the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contract used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on pound sterling denominated balance sheet items was 10.5 million, or $13.6 million, with a contract maturity of 1 month. the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were liabilities of $0.7 million and $0.6 million as of december 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2011 2010 2009 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ (4,027 ) $ (1,280 ) $ 5,222 realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) 298 (2,638 ) (261 ) unrealized derivative losses (31 ) (809 ) (1,060 ) realized derivative gains (losses) 1,696 3,549 (4,412 ) we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 44 table of contentsrisk factors 7 risk factors forward-looking statements some of the statements contained in this form 10-k and the documents incorporated herein by reference

adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty. we have limited experience operating a business during a recessionary period or during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment and can therefore not predict the full impact of a downturn in the economy on our sales and profitability, including how our business responds when the economy is recovering from a recession or periods of slow growth. a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2012 , approximately 22% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $1,834.9 million in 2012 from $ 725.2 million in 2008 . if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees. in addition, as our business becomes more complex through the introduction of more new products and the expansion of our distribution channels, including additional specialty and factory house stores and expanded distribution in malls and department stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success 8 table of contents depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. in addition, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season from august through november. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we currently do not own any fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; 9 table of contents readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2012 , ten manufacturers produced approximately 49% of our products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. 10 table of contents labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of the north america. during the year ended december 31, 2012 , 94% of our net revenues were earned in north america. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2012 , our products were manufactured by 27 primary manufacturers, operating in 14 countries. of these, ten manufactured approximately 49% of our products, at locations in cambodia, china, el salvador, honduras, jordan, mexico, nicaragua and the philippines . during 2012 , approximately 53% of our products were manufactured in asia , 19% in central and south america , 18% in the middle east and 8% in mexico . as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under a revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $ 300.0 million . the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: 11 table of contents use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; incur additional indebtedness; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guarantee certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and materially change our line of business. our revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. a default under the credit agreement could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2012 . we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear line. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing and introduction of advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. 12 table of contents the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from two nearby locations in maryland, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers' or employees' personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. in addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks. 13 table of contents changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as recent investments in our direct to consumer sales channel or our recent minority investment in our japanese licensee. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman, chief executive officer and president. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. kevin plank, our chairman, chief executive officer and president controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock, or class a stock, has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock, or class b stock, has 10 votes per share. our chairman, chief executive officer and president, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration 14 table of contents of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. the class b stock automatically converts to class a stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b stock outstanding. otherwise the class b stock does not convert to class a stock until mr. plank's death or disability. as a result, mr. plank can retain his voting control even after he is no longer affiliated with the company. our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. there may be obstacles that arise as we expand our product line and geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe. the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. to date, net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant. however, as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, if we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in canada and europe) and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. from time to time, we may elect to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our european and canadian subsidiaries. in addition, we may elect to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on pound sterling denominated balance sheet items. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2012 , we receive u.s. dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of 0.99 cad per $1.00, u.s. dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.76 per $1.00 and euros in exchange for pounds sterling at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.81 per 1.00. as of december 31, 2012 , the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our canadian subsidiary's intercompany transactions was $ 1.0 million with contract maturities of 1 month or less. as of december 31, 2012 , the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our european subsidiary's intercompany transactions was $ 25.6 million with contract maturities of 1 month. the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. the fair values of the company's foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $ 4.8 thousand as of december 31, 2012, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair values of the company's foreign currency forward contracts were liabilities of $ 0.7 million as of december 31, 2011 , and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2012 2011 2010 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ 2,464 $ (4,027 ) $ (1,280 ) realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) (182 ) 298 (2,638 ) unrealized derivative gains (losses) 675 (31 ) (809 ) realized derivative gains (losses) (3,030 ) 1,696 3,549 we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, 35 table of contents we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk in order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. in december 2012, we began utilizing an interest rate swap contract to convert a portion of variable rate debt under the new $50.0 million loan to fixed rate debt. the contract pays fixed and receives variable rates of interest based on one-month libor and has a maturity date of december 2019. the interest rate swap contract is accounted for as a cash flow hedge and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. as of december 31, 2012, the notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contract was $25.0 million. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recorded a $21.1 thousand increase in interest expense, representing interest incurred on the arrangement. the fair value of the interest rate swap contract was a liability of $0.1 million as of december 31, 2012, and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2012. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 36

international distribution channels; our ability to effectively develop and launch new, innovative and updated products; our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands; increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing market share; fluctuations in the costs of our products; loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner; our ability to further expand our business globally and to drive brand awareness and consumer acceptance of our products in other countries; our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to

should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty. we have limited experience operating a business during a recessionary period or during periods of slow economic growth and high unemployment and can therefore not predict the full impact of a downturn in the economy on our sales and profitability, including how our business responds when the economy is recovering from a recession or periods of slow growth. a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2012 , approximately 22% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $1,834.9 million in 2012 from $ 725.2 million in 2008 . if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees. in addition, as our business becomes more complex through the introduction of more new products and the expansion of our distribution channels, including additional specialty and factory house stores and expanded distribution in malls and department stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success 8 table of contents depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. in addition, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season from august through november. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we currently do not own any fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; 9 table of contents readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2012 , ten manufacturers produced approximately 49% of our products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. 10 table of contents labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of the north america. during the year ended december 31, 2012 , 94% of our net revenues were earned in north america. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2012 , our products were manufactured by 27 primary manufacturers, operating in 14 countries. of these, ten manufactured approximately 49% of our products, at locations in cambodia, china, el salvador, honduras, jordan, mexico, nicaragua and the philippines . during 2012 , approximately 53% of our products were manufactured in asia , 19% in central and south america , 18% in the middle east and 8% in mexico . as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and other charges on imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under a revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $ 300.0 million . the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: 11 table of contents use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; incur additional indebtedness; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guarantee certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and materially change our line of business. our revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. a default under the credit agreement could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december 31, 2012 . we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. these variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher priced coldgear line. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2012 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing and introduction of advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. 12 table of contents the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from two nearby locations in maryland, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers' or employees' personal information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. in addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks. 13 table of contents changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as recent investments in our direct to consumer sales channel or our recent minority investment in our japanese licensee. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman, chief executive officer and president. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. kevin plank, our chairman, chief executive officer and president controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock, or class a stock, has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock, or class b stock, has 10 votes per share. our chairman, chief executive officer and president, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our

automatically converts to class a stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b stock outstanding. otherwise the class b stock does not convert to class a stock until mr. plank's death or disability. as a result, mr. plank can retain his voting control even after he is no longer affiliated with the company. our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. there may be obstacles that arise as we expand our product line and geographic scope of our marketing. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe. the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. to date, net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant. however, as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, if we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in canada and europe) and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. from time to time, we may elect to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our european and canadian subsidiaries. in addition, we may elect to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on pound sterling denominated balance sheet items. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2012 , we receive u.s. dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of 0.99 cad per $1.00, u.s. dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.76 per $1.00 and euros in exchange for pounds sterling at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.81 per 1.00. as of december 31, 2012 , the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our canadian subsidiary's intercompany transactions was $ 1.0 million with contract maturities of 1 month or less. as of december 31, 2012 , the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our european subsidiary's intercompany transactions was $ 25.6 million with contract maturities of 1 month. the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. the fair values of the company's foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $ 4.8 thousand as of december 31, 2012, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair values of the company's foreign currency forward contracts were liabilities of $ 0.7 million as of december 31, 2011 , and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2012 2011 2010 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ 2,464 $ (4,027 ) $ (1,280 ) realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) (182 ) 298 (2,638 ) unrealized derivative gains (losses) 675 (31 ) (809 ) realized derivative gains (losses) (3,030 ) 1,696 3,549 we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, 35 table of contents we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk in order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. in december 2012, we began utilizing an interest rate swap contract to convert a portion of variable rate debt under the new $50.0 million loan to fixed rate debt. the contract pays fixed and receives variable rates of interest based on one-month libor and has a maturity date of december 2019. the interest rate swap contract is accounted for as a cash flow hedge and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. as of december 31, 2012, the notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contract was $25.0 million. during the year ended december 31, 2012, we recorded a $21.1 thousand increase in interest expense, representing interest incurred on the arrangement. the fair value of the interest rate swap contract was a liability of $0.1 million as of december 31, 2012, and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2012. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 36

this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. 8 table of contents during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty. a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, retail customers may be more cautious with orders. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2013 , approximately 22% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our two largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $2,332.1 million in 2013 from $856.4 million in 2009 . if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees. in addition, as our business becomes more complex through the introduction of more new products and the expansion of our distribution channels, including additional brand and factory house stores and expanded distribution in malls and department stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 9 table of contents even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. in addition, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season, during the last two quarters of the year. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our 10 table of contents competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2013 , fourteen manufacturers produced approximately 65% of our products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience 11 table of contents significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of the north america. during the year ended december 31, 2013 , 94% of our net revenues were earned in north america. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2013 , our products were manufactured by 26 primary manufacturers, operating in 19 countries. of these, fourteen manufactured approximately 65% of our products, with primary locations in jordan, philippines, china, nicaragua. malaysia, cambodia, indonesia, vietnam, mexico, el salvador and honduras. during 2013 , approximately 66% of our products were manufactured in asia , 14% in central and south america , 15% in the middle east and 5% in mexico . as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials, hamper our ability to sell products in international markets and increase our cost of doing business generally. in the 12 table of contents event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under a revolving credit facility. our revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $ 300.0 million . the agreement for our revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to: use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions; incur additional indebtedness; sell certain assets; make certain investments; guarantee certain obligations of third parties; undergo a merger or consolidation; and materially change our line of business. our revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. a default under the credit agreement could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on substantially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. in addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against, increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. as of december 31, 2013, we had $100.0 million drawn under our revolving credit facility and $200.0 million of availability. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to increased sales volume of our products during the fall season, 13 table of contents including our higher price cold weather products. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2013 , 2012 and 2011 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could harm our brand as well as our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. 14 table of contents if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from two nearby locations in maryland, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. the failure of these systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. we communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. therefore a service interruption or shutdown could negatively impact our operating activities. furthermore, we engage in personal data collection and utilize information technology in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data. an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks. any breach of our network or payment processing systems may result in the loss of valuable business data, our customers', consumers' or employees' information or a disruption of our business, which could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our customer or consumer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as our recent acquisition of mapmyfitness and certain assets of our distributor in mexico. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business, including our ability to successfully integrate new businesses into our company and realize expected synergies and benefits. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, including the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. in addition, through our purchase of mapmyfitness, we entered into a new line of business related to connected fitness. prior to this acquisition, we had limited experience in the connected fitness business. if we are unable to successfully operate this business, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of this acquisition. 15 table of contents our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock, or class a stock, has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock, or class b stock, has 10 votes per share. our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. the class b stock automatically converts to class a stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b stock outstanding. otherwise the class b stock does not convert to class a stock until mr. plank's death or disability. as a result, mr. plank can retain his voting control even after he is no longer affiliated with the company. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, including mapmyfitness. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 16 table of contents our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us . from time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. any of these proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. although we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and our brand image. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 37 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. as our net revenues and certain expenses generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, as we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. from time to time, we may elect to use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations primarily on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our international subsidiaries. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. as of december 31, 2013 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $20.6 million , which was comprised of canadian dollar/u.s. dollar, euro/u.s. dollar, and pound sterling/euro currency pairs with contract maturities of 1 month. the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2013 have weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rates of 1.07 cad per $1.00, 0.73 per $1.00, and 0.83 per 1.00. the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. the fair values of the company's foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $ 12.1 thousand and $4.8 thousand as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2013 2012 2011 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ (1,905 ) $ 2,464 $ (4,027 ) realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) 477 (182 ) 298 unrealized derivative gains (losses) 13 675 (31 ) realized derivative gains (losses) 243 (3,030 ) 1,696 37 table of contents we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk in order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. in december 2012, we began utilizing an interest rate swap contract to convert a portion of variable rate debt under the $50.0 million loan to fixed rate debt. the contract pays fixed and receives variable rates of interest based on one-month libor and has a maturity date of december 2019. the interest rate swap contract is accounted for as a cash flow hedge and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. as of december 31, 2013, the notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contract was $25.0 million. during the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012, we recorded a $317.6 thousand and $21.1 thousand increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contract reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. the fair value of the interest rate swap contract was an asset of $1.1 million as of december 31, 2013, and was included in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair value of the interest rate swap contract was a liability of $0.1 million as of december 31, 2012, and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2013. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in recent periods, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 38 table of contentsrisk factors 8 risk factors forward-looking statements some of the statements contained in this form 10-k

financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty. a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, retail customers may be more cautious with orders. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2014 , approximately 14.4% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our largest customer. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with this customer or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. if we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $3,084.4 million in 2014 from $1,063.9 million in 2010 . if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we could be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. this expansion could increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees. in addition, as our business becomes more complex through the introduction of more new products and the expansion of our distribution channels, including additional brand and factory house stores and expanded distribution in malls and department stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as negatively impact the price of our class a common stock. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. for example, as part of our ongoing business strategy we have engaged in acquisitions to grow and enhance our connected fitness business. in order to successfully execute this strategy, we must manage the integration of acquired companies and employees successfully. because our connected fitness business is a relatively new line of business for us, these challenges 9 table of contents may be more pronounced. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. failing to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or to produce results consistent with financial models used in the analysis of our acquisitions could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of users, maintain or increase user engagement or ultimately realize expected revenues from our connected fitness community. for example, we may not successfully increase sales of our apparel, footwear and accessory products to these users. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as negatively impact the price of our class a common stock. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower sales and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. in addition, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. the failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season, during the last two quarters of the year. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. 10 table of contents the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. we operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 11 table of contents fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2014 , 10 manufacturers produced approximately 52% of our products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of the north america. during the year ended december 31, 2014 , 91% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to 12 table of contents delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2014 , our products were manufactured by 29 primary manufacturers, operating in 14 countries, with 10 manufacturers accounting for approximately 52% of our products. approximately 65% of our products were manufactured in china, jordan, vietnam and indonesia. as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials, hamper our ability to sell products in international markets and increase our cost of doing business generally. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility. the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. 13 table of contents our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our class a common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2014 , 2013 and 2012 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our class a common stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we currently generate 86.6% of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation or reported (or alleged) violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. 14 table of contents our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could harm our brand as well as our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations , our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business increasingly relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could negatively impact our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. 15 table of contents data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data, particularly with respect to our connected fitness business. compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters or investments in our connected fitness business. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. 16 table of contents kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock, or class a stock, has one vote per share and our class b convertible common stock, or class b stock, has 10 votes per share. our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control. the class b stock automatically converts to class a stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b stock outstanding. otherwise the class b stock does not convert to class a stock until mr. plank's death or disability. as a result, mr. plank can retain his voting control even after he is no longer affiliated with the company. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, particularly in our connected fitness business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. 17 table of contents we are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us . from time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. any of these proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. although we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and our brand image. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. as our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, as we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. from time to time, we may elect to use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations primarily on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our international subsidiaries. as we expand our international business, we anticipate expanding our current hedging program to include additional currency pairs and instruments. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. as of december 31, 2014 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $123.3 million , which was comprised of canadian dollar/u.s. dollar, euro/u.s. dollar, yen/euro, mexican peso/euro and pound sterling/euro currency pairs with contract maturities of one to eleven months. the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2014 have weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rates of 1.13 cad per $1.00, 0.83 per $1.00, 145.16 jpy per 1.00, 17.85 mxn per 1.00 and 0.78 per 1.00. the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. during 2014, we began entering into foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. for foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, excluding any ineffective portion, is recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged transaction. the 38 table of contents effective portion is generally released to net income after the maturity of the related derivative and is classified in the same manner as the underlying exposure. during the year ended december 31, 2014 , we reclassified $0.4 million from other comprehensive income to cost of goods sold related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. the fair values of the company's foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $ 806.0 thousand and $12.1 thousand as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2014 2013 2012 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ (11,739 ) $ (1,905 ) $ 2,464 realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) 2,247 477 (182 ) unrealized derivative gains (losses) 1 13 675 realized derivative gains (losses) 3,081 243 (3,030 ) we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk i n order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. we utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. the contracts pay fixed and receive variable rates of interest. the interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation . as of december 31, 2014 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts was $188.1 million . during the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 , we recorded a $1.7 million and $0.3 million increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contracts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of $0.6 million as of december 31, 2014 , and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair value of the interest rate swap contract was an asset of $1.1 million as of december 31, 2013 and was included in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. credit risk w e are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2014 . inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in recent periods, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 39 table of contentsrisk factors 8 risk factors forward-looking statements some of the statements contained in this form 10-k and the documents incorporated herein by reference constitute

spending; changes to the financial health of our customers; our ability to effectively manage our growth and a more complex global business; our ability to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments or capital expenditures; our ability to effectively develop and launch new, innovative and updated products; our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands; increased competition causing us to lose market share or reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts; fluctuations in the costs of our products; loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, including due to port disruptions; our ability to further expand our business globally and to drive brand awareness and consumer acceptance of our products in other countries; our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results; risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to effectively market and maintain a positive brand image; our ability to comply with trade and other regulations; the availability, integration and effective operation of information systems and other technology, as well as any potential interruption of such systems or technology; risks related to data security or privacy breaches; our ability to raise additional capital required to grow our business on terms acceptable to us; our potential exposure to litigation and other proceedings; and our ability to attract and retain the services of our senior management and key employees. 8 table of contents the forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-k reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date of this form 10-k. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty. a downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, insolvency or cease operations, this could have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2015 , approximately 11.5% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our largest customer. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with this customer or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. we must continue to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business or we may not achieve our long-term growth targets and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $3,963.3 million in 2015 from $1,472.7 million in 2011 . our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to not only maintain strong growth throughout our business, but to also successfully execute on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. in addition to successfully executing on our long-term growth strategies, we must also continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and 9 table of contents technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees, and obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as negatively impact the price of our publicly traded common stock. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. for example, as part of our ongoing business strategy we have engaged in acquisitions to grow and enhance our connected fitness business. in order to successfully execute this strategy, we must manage the integration of acquired companies and employees successfully. because our connected fitness business is a relatively new line of business for us, these challenges may be more pronounced. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. failing to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or to produce results consistent with financial models used in the analysis of our acquisitions could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of users, maintain or increase user engagement or ultimately realize expected revenues from our connected fitness community. for example, we may not successfully increase sales of our apparel, footwear and accessory products to these users. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as negatively impact the price of our publicly traded common stock. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline. in addition, if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. our failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season, during the last two quarters of the year. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; 10 table of contents weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully 11 table of contents against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2015 , 10 manufacturers produced approximately 45% of our products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. 12 table of contents our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2015 , 87% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2015 , our products were manufactured by 44 primary manufacturers, operating in 16 countries, with 10 manufacturers accounting for approximately 45% of our products. approximately 63% of our products were manufactured in china, jordan, vietnam and indonesia. as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials, hamper our ability to sell products in international markets and increase our cost of doing business generally. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility. the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. 13 table of contents we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us or at all. financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2015 , 2014 and 2013 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we currently generate 82% of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation or reported (or alleged) violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. 14 table of contents sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could harm our brand as well as our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations , our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business increasingly relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, 15 table of contents such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could negatively impact our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data, particularly with respect to our connected fitness business. compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. many of the countries in which we do business have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as result of the base erosion and profit shifting final proposals from the organization for economic co-operation and development and specific country anti-avoidance initiates. such tax law changes increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax provision. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters investments to implement our enterprise resource planning systems, or investments in our connected fitness business. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. 16 table of contents we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, particularly in our connected fitness business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. 17 table of contents we are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us . from time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. any of these proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. although we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and our brand image. the trading price for our class a common stock may fluctuate from time to time, and if the shares of our new class of non-voting class c common stock are distributed as expected, the trading price of that class may experience volatility and may impact the trading price for our class a common stock . the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, we have previously announced the intention of our board of directors to consider distributing shares of our new non-voting class c common stock as a dividend to the holders of our class a and class b common stock. the decision to proceed with, and timing of, this dividend will be made by our board of directors in its discretion and there can be no assurance that this dividend will be declared or paid. we expect that the market price for the shares of our class a common stock will generally reflect the effect of a two-for-one stock split once the dividend is distributed. although we plan to list the new class c common stock on the new york stock exchange, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, a liquid trading market will develop for the new class. if it does not or if the class c common stock is not attractive to targets as an acquisition currency or to our employees as an equity incentive, we may not achieve all of the benefits we anticipated from creating this new class. as in the case of the class a common stock, the trading price for the class c common stock may also be volatile and affected by the factors noted above, as well as by the difference in voting rights between the class a and class c common stock. whether or not the class c common stock is included in stock indices in the future, such as the s&amp;p 500 index, may also affect the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock. kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share and our class b common stock has 10 votes per share. our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding and in other limited circumstances. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, if our class c common stock is issued, the class c common stock will carry no voting rights (except in limited circumstances), and the continued issuance of the class c common stock in future stock-based acquisition transactions or to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk 39 table of contents we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. as our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, as we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. from time to time, we may elect to use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations primarily on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our international subsidiaries. as we expand our international business, we anticipate expanding our current hedging program to include additional currency pairs and instruments. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. as of december 31, 2015 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $468.1 million , which was comprised of canadian dollar/u.s. dollar, euro/u.s. dollar, yen/euro, mexican peso/euro and pound sterling/euro currency pairs with contract maturities of one to eleven months. the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december 31, 2015 have weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rates of 1.38 cad per $1.00, 0.91 per $1.00, 135.83 jpy per 1.00, 18.82 mxn per 1.00 and 0.74 per 1.00. the majority of our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. during 2014, we began entering into foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges. for foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, excluding any ineffective portion, is recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged transaction. the effective portion is generally released to net income after the maturity of the related derivative and is classified in the same manner as the underlying exposure. during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 , we reclassified $3.5 million and $0.4 million from other comprehensive income to cost of goods sold related to foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, respectively. the fair values of the company's foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $ 3.8 million and $0.8 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2015 2014 2013 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ (33,359 ) $ (11,739 ) $ (1,905 ) realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) 7,643 2,247 477 unrealized derivative gains (losses) 388 1 13 realized derivative gains (losses) 16,404 3,081 243 we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk i n order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. we utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. the contracts pay fixed and receive variable rates of interest. the interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation . as of december 31, 2015 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts was $170.7 million . during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 , we recorded a $2.7 million and $1.7 million increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contracts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive 40 table of contents income. the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of $1.5 million and $0.6 million as of december 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively, and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. credit risk w e are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2015 . see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies and estimates - allowance for doubtful accounts." inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in recent periods, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 41 table of contentsrisk factors 8 risk factors

contents the forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-k reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date of this form 10-k. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in north america, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2016 , sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 65% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2016 , approximately 10% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our largest customer. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with this customer or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to sustain similar net revenue growth. we must continue to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business or we may not achieve our long-term growth targets and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $4,825.3 million in 2016 from $1,834.9 million in 2012. our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to not only maintain strong growth throughout our business, but to also successfully execute on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. our ability to invest in these growth initiatives in the near- 9 table of contents term also depends on our ability to maintain net revenue growth in north america (our largest market), which represented 83% of our total net revenues in 2016 . if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. in addition to successfully executing on our long-term growth strategies, we must also continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees, and obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. for example, as part of our ongoing business strategy we have engaged in acquisitions to grow and enhance our connected fitness business. in order to successfully execute this strategy, we must manage the integration of acquired companies and employees successfully. because our connected fitness business is a relatively new line of business for us, these challenges may be more pronounced. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. failing to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or to produce results consistent with financial models used in the analysis of our acquisitions could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of users, maintain or increase user engagement or ultimately realize expected revenues from our connected fitness community. for example, we may not successfully increase sales of our apparel, footwear and accessory products to these users. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline. in addition, if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. our failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season, during the last two quarters of the year. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. 10 table of contents factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and 11 table of contents engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2016 , 10 manufacturers produced approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and three manufacturers produced approximately 70% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. 12 table of contents labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2016 , 83% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2016 , our products were manufactured by 39 primary manufacturers, operating in 18 countries, with 10 manufacturers accounting for approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and three manufacturers accounting for approximately 70% of our footwear products. approximately 60% of our apparel and accessories products were manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials, hamper our ability to sell products in international markets and increase our cost of doing business generally. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility. the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in 13 table of contents addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we currently generate 80% of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. 14 table of contents the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our ability to achieve our growth targets could be impacted if negative publicity diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could harm our brand as well as our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity 15 table of contents is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could negatively impact our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data, particularly with respect to our connected fitness business. compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. we are in the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes, which began in 2015 and will continue in phases over the next several years. we plan to substantially complete the migration of our north america, emea and connected fitness operations to this system during 2017, and are in the process of developing an implementation strategy and roll-out plan for our asia-pacific and latin american regions. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design or implementation of these 16 table of contents systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. many of the countries in which we do business have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as result of the base erosion and profit shifting final proposals from the organization for economic co-operation and development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. in addition, significant tax law changes are being evaluated by the federal government of the united states, our most significant country of operation. such tax law changes, if enacted, could materially increase our tax obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments in our connected fitness business. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, 17 table of contents marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, particularly in our connected fitness business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us . from time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. any of these proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. although we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and our brand image. the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time . the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our class c common stock has traded at a discount to and with less liquidity than our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. 18 table of contents kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding and in other limited circumstances. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 item 8

distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. the brand's performance apparel and footwear are engineered in many designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and are worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. our connected fitness strategy is focused on connecting with our consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our existing product offerings through our global wholesale and direct to consumer channels. we plan to engage and grow this community by developing innovative applications, services and other digital solutions to impact how athletes and fitness-minded individuals train, perform and live. our net revenues are generated primarily from the wholesale sales of our products to national, regional, independent and specialty retailers. we also generate net revenue from the sale of our products through our direct to consumer sales channel, which includes our brand and factory house stores and websites, from product licensing and from digital platform licensing and subscriptions and digital advertising through our connected fitness business. a large majority of our products are sold in north america; however we believe that our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. internationally, our net revenues are generated from a mix of wholesale sales to retailers and distributors and sales through our direct to consumer sales channels, and license revenue from sales by our third party licensees. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. virtually all of our products are manufactured by our unaffiliated primary manufacturers operating in 18 countries outside of the united states. we were incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1996. as used in this report, the terms we, our, us, under armour and the company refer to under armour, inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. we have registered trademarks around the globe, including under armour , heatgear , coldgear , allseasongear and the under armour ua logo, and we have applied to register many other trademarks. this annual report on form 10-k also contains additional trademarks and tradenames of our company and our subsidiaries. all trademarks and tradenames appearing in this annual report on form 10-k are the property of their respective holders. products our product offerings consist of apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. we market our products at multiple price levels and provide consumers with products that we believe are a superior alternative to traditional athletic products. in 2016 , sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 67% , 21% and 8% of net revenues, respectively. we introduced a new limited line of apparel and footwear product under the uas , or under armour sportswear label in 2016, and expect to continue to broaden our sportswear and lifestyle product offerings. licensing arrangements, primarily for the sale of our products, and revenue from our connected fitness business represented the remaining 4% of net revenues. refer to note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for net revenues by product. apparel our apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility, regulate body temperature and improve performance regardless of weather conditions. our apparel is engineered to replace traditional non-performance fabrics in the world of athletics and fitness with performance alternatives designed and merchandised along gearlines. our three gearlines are marketed to tell a very simple story about our highly technical products and extend across the sporting goods, outdoor and active lifestyle markets. we market our apparel for consumers to choose heatgear when it is hot, coldgear when it is cold and allseasongear between the extremes. within each gearline our apparel comes in three primary fit types: compression (tight fit), fitted (athletic fit) and loose (relaxed). heatgear is designed to be worn in warm to hot temperatures under equipment or as a single layer. while a sweat-soaked traditional non-performance t-shirt can weigh two to three pounds, heatgear is engineered with a microfiber blend designed to wick moisture from the body which helps the body stay cool, dry and light. we offer 1 table of contents heatgear in a variety of tops and bottoms in a broad array of colors and styles for wear in the gym or outside in warm weather. coldgear is designed to wick moisture from the body while circulating body heat from hot spots to help maintain core body temperature. our coldgear apparel provides both dryness and warmth in a single light layer that can be worn beneath a jersey, uniform, protective gear or ski-vest, and our coldgear outerwear products protect the athlete, as well as the coach and the fan from the outside in. our coldgear products generally sell at higher prices than our other gearlines. allseasongear is designed to be worn in between extreme temperatures and uses technical fabrics to keep the wearer cool and dry in warmer temperatures while preventing a chill in cooler temperatures. footwear our footwear offerings include running, basketball, cleated, slides and performance training, and outdoor footwear. our footwear is light, breathable and built with performance attributes for athletes. our footwear is designed with innovative technologies including anafoam , ua clutch fit and charged cushioning , which provide stabilization, directional cushioning and moisture management engineered to maximize the athlete's comfort and control. accessories accessories primarily includes the sale of athletic performance gloves, bags and headwear. our accessories include heatgear and coldgear technologies and are designed with advanced fabrications to provide the same level of performance as our other products. connected fitness we offer digital fitness platform licenses and subscriptions, along with digital advertising through our mapmyfitness, myfitnesspal, endomondo and ua record applications. license we have agreements with our licensees to develop under armour apparel, accessories and equipment. our product, marketing and sales teams are involved in substantially all steps of the design and go to market process in order to maintain brand standards and consistency. during 2016 , our licensees offered collegiate, national football league ("nfl) and major league baseball ("mlb") apparel and accessories, baby and kids' apparel, team uniforms, socks, water bottles, eyewear and other specific hard goods equipment that feature performance advantages and functionality similar to our other product offerings. marketing and promotion we currently focus on marketing and selling our products to consumers primarily for use in athletics, fitness, training and outdoor activities. we seek to drive consumer demand by building brand equity and awareness that our products deliver advantages that help athletes perform better. sports marketing our marketing and promotion strategy begins with providing and selling our products to high-performing athletes and teams on the high school, collegiate and professional levels. we execute this strategy through outfitting agreements, professional and collegiate sponsorships, individual athlete agreements and by providing and selling our products directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. as a result, our products are seen on the field, giving them exposure to various consumer audiences through the internet, television, magazines and live at sporting events. this exposure to consumers helps us establish on-field authenticity as consumers can see our products being worn by high-performing athletes. we are the official outfitter of athletic teams in several high-profile collegiate conferences. we are an official supplier of footwear and gloves to the nfl. we are the official performance footwear supplier of mlb and a partner with the national basketball association ( nba ) which allows us to market our nba athletes in game uniforms in connection with our basketball footwear. we are the official headwear and performance apparel provider for the nfl scouting combine and the official partner and title sponsor of the nba draft combine, in each case with the right to sell licensed combine training apparel and headwear. in 2016, we entered into an agreement to be the official on-field uniform supplier, official authentic performance apparel partner, and official connected fitness partner of mlb, beginning with the 2020 season, which will allow us to provide on-field uniforms, apparel, and accessories to all thirty 2 table of contents mlb clubs on an exclusive basis, and, together with our manufacturing partner sell a broad range of mlb licensed merchandise. internationally, we sponsor and sell our products to several european and latin american soccer and rugby teams, which helps drive brand awareness in various countries and regions around the world. we also seek to sponsor events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level. we host combines, camps and clinics for athletes in many sports at regional sites across the country. these events, along with the products we make, are designed to help young athletes improve their training methods and their overall performance. we are also the title sponsor of a collection of high school all-america games that create significant on-field product and brand exposure that contributes to our on-field authenticity. media we feature our products in a variety of national digital, broadcast, and print media outlets. we also utilize social and mobile media to engage consumers and promote conversation around our brand and our products. retail presentation the primary component of our retail marketing strategy is to increase brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. the design and funding of under armour concept shops within our major retail accounts has been a key initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our brand. under armour concept shops enhance our brand's presentation within our major retail accounts with a shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images. sales and distribution the majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels, which include national and regional sporting goods chains, independent and specialty retailers, department store chains, institutional athletic departments and leagues and teams. in addition, we sell our products to independent distributors in various countries where we generally do not have direct sales operations and through licensees. we also sell our products directly to consumers through our own network of brand and factory house stores in our north america, europe, the middle east and africa ( emea ), latin america and asia-pacific operating segments, and through websites globally. factory house stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing us to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products while maintaining the pricing integrity of our brand in our other distribution channels. through our brand house stores, consumers experience our brand first-hand and have broader access to our performance products. in 2016 , sales through our wholesale, direct to consumer, licensing and connected fitness channels represented 65% , 31% , 2% and 2% of net revenues, respectively. we believe the trend toward performance products is global and plan to continue to introduce our products and simple merchandising story to athletes throughout the world. we are introducing our performance apparel, footwear and accessories outside of north america in a manner consistent with our past brand-building strategy, including selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes in these markets, thereby providing us with product exposure to broad audiences of potential consumers. our primary business operates in four geographic segments: (1) north america, comprising the united states and canada, (2) emea, (3) asia-pacific, and (4) latin america. each of these geographic segments operate predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and distribution of performance apparel, footwear and accessories. we also operate our connected fitness business as a separate segment. due to the individual materiality of our asia-pacific segment, we have separately presented our asia-pacific, emea and latin america segments, as of december 31, 2016, and will no longer combine these segments for presentation purposes. net revenues by segment presented for prior periods has been conformed to the current presentation. the following table presents net revenues by segment for each of the years ending december 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014

approximately 83% of our net revenues for 2016 . we sell our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in north america through our wholesale and direct to consumer channels. net revenues generated from the sales of our products in the united states were $3.8 billion , $3.3 billion and $2.6 billion for the years ended december 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 respectively and, with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of our long-lived assets were located in the united states. our largest customer, dick's sporting goods, accounted for approximately 10% of our net revenues in 2016 . no other customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues. our direct to consumer sales are generated through our brand and factory house stores, along with internet websites. as of december 31, 2016 , we had 151 factory house stores in north america primarily located in outlet centers throughout the united states. as of december 31, 2016 , we had 18 brand house stores in north america. consumers can purchase our products directly from our e-commerce website, www.underarmour.com. in addition, we earn licensing revenue in north america based on our licensees' collegiate and mlb apparel and accessories, baby and kids' apparel, team uniforms, socks, water bottles, eyewear and inflatable footballs and basketballs and other specific hard goods equipment. in order to maintain consistent quality and performance, we pre-approve all products manufactured and sold by our licensees, and our quality assurance team strives to ensure that the products meet the same quality and compliance standards as the products that we sell directly. we distribute the majority of our products sold to our north american wholesale customers and our brand and factory house stores from distribution facilities we lease and operate in california, maryland and tennessee. in addition, we distribute our products in north america through third-party logistics providers with primary locations in canada, new jersey and florida. in some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from the factories that manufacture our products directly to customer-designated facilities. international approximately 15.4% of our net revenues were generated from our international segments in 2016 . we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term in part through expansion in international markets. emea we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories primarily through wholesale customers, website operations, independent distributors and a limited number of stores we operate in certain european countries. we also sell our branded products to various sports clubs and teams in europe. we generally distribute our products to our retail customers and e-commerce consumers in europe through a third-party logistics provider. we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories primarily through independent distributors in the middle east and africa. asia-pacific we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories products in china, south korea, and australia through stores operated by our distribution and wholesale partners, along with website operations and stores we operate. prior to late 2016, our products were sold through a license in south korea. we also sell our products to distributors in new zealand, taiwan, hong kong and other countries in southeast asia where we do not have direct sales operations. we distribute our products in asia-pacific primarily through a third-party logistics provider based out of hong kong. we have a license agreement with dome corporation, which produces, markets and sells our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in japan. our branded products are sold in japan to large sporting goods retailers, independent specialty stores and professional sports teams, and through licensee-owned retail stores. we hold a cost-based minority investment in dome. 4 table of contents latin america we sell our products in mexico, chile and brazil through wholesale customers, website operations and brand and factory house stores. in these countries we operate through third-party distribution facilities. in other latin american countries we distribute our products through independent distributors which are sourced through our international distribution hubs in hong kong, jordan and the united states. connected fitness in 2013, we began offering digital fitness subscriptions and licenses, along with digital advertising through our mapmyfitness platform. in 2014, we introduced the ua record platform and in 2015, we acquired the endomondo and myfitnesspal platforms to create our connected fitness business. approximately 1.6% of our net revenues were generated from our connected fitness business in 2016 . we plan to engage and grow this community by developing innovative applications, services and other digital solutions to impact how athletes and fitness-minded individuals train, perform and live. seasonality historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher priced cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. product design and development our products are manufactured with technical fabrications produced by third parties and developed in collaboration with our product development teams. this approach enables us to select and create superior, technically advanced fabrics, produced to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on design, fit, climate and product end use. we seek to regularly upgrade and improve our products with the latest in innovative technology while broadening our product offerings. our goal, to deliver superior performance in all our products, provides our developers and licensees with a clear, overarching direction for the brand and helps them identify new opportunities to create performance products that meet the changing needs of athletes. we design products with visible technology, utilizing color, texture and fabrication to enhance our customers' perception and understanding of product use and benefits. our product development team works closely with our sports marketing and sales teams as well as professional and collegiate athletes to identify product trends and determine market needs. for example, these teams worked closely to identify the opportunity and market for our coldgear infrared product, which is a ceramic print technology on the inside of our garments that provides athletes with lightweight warmth, and speedform , a proprietary 3-dimensional molding technology for footwear which delivers superior fit and feel. in 2016, we introduced ua coolswitch, a fabric treatment with sweat-activated cooling technology and threadborne, a soft micro-engineered fabric that provides lightweight directional strength and support at the yarn level. sourcing, manufacturing and quality assurance many of the specialty fabrics and other raw materials used in our apparel products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short term, from a limited number of sources. the fabric and other raw materials used to manufacture our apparel products are sourced by our contracted manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us. in 2016 , approximately 52% of the fabric used in our apparel products came from five suppliers. these fabric suppliers have primary locations in taiwan, malaysia and mexico . the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. we also use cotton in our apparel products, as blended fabric and also in our charged cotton line. cotton is a commodity that is subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. additionally, our footwear uses raw materials that are sourced from a diverse base of third party suppliers. this includes chemicals and petroleum-based components such as rubber that are also subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers. in 2016 , our apparel and accessories products were manufactured by 39 primary contract manufacturers, operating in 18 countries, with 5 table of contents approximately 60% of our apparel and accessories products manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. of our 39 primary contract manufacturers, 10 produced approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products. in 2016 , our footwear products were manufactured by seven primary contract manufacturers, operating primarily in china, vietnam and indonesia. of our seven primary contract manufacturers, three produced approximately 70% of our footwear products. all manufacturers are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our internal teams prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. we also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of goods sold. we enter into a variety of agreements with our contract manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing and working conditions and other social concerns. we do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term. we have subsidiaries in hong kong, panama, vietnam, indonesia, china and taiwan to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for our products. we also manufacture a limited number of products primarily for high-profile athletes and teams, on-premises in our quick turn, special make-up shop located at one of our facilities in maryland. inventory management inventory management is important to the financial condition and operating results of our business. we manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. these systems and processes are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. our practice, and the general practice in the apparel, footwear and accessory industries, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. as it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. this can affect our inventory levels as we build pre-launch quantities. intellectual property we believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products, both domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. our major trademarks include the ua logo and under armour , both of which are registered in the united states, canada, mexico, the european union, japan, china and numerous other countries. we also own trademark registrations for other trademarks including, among others, ua , armour , heatgear , coldgear , allseasongear , protect this house , i will , and many trademarks that incorporate the term armour such as armourbite , armourstorm , armour fleece, and armour bra . we also own applications to protect new connected fitness branding such as ua record , ua healthbox and under armour connected fitness . we own domain names for our primary trademarks (most notably underarmour.com and ua.com) and hold copyright registrations for several commercials, as well as for certain artwork. we intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. we will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally. we believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our products from those of others. these trademarks are among our most valuable assets. in addition to our distinctive trademarks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, and we believe our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace. we traditionally have had limited patent protection on much of the technology, materials and processes used in the manufacture of our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, particularly in our connected fitness business. as we continue to expand and drive innovation in our products, we expect to seek patent protection on products, features and concepts we believe to be strategic and important to our business. we will continue to file patent applications where we deem appropriate 6 table of contents to protect our new products, innovations and designs. we expect the number of applications to increase as our business grows and as we continue to expand our products and innovate. competition the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. many of the fabrics and technology used in manufacturing our products are not unique to us, and we own a limited number of fabric or process patents. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition and significantly greater resources than us, such as nike and adidas. we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel, and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. in addition, we must compete with others for purchasing decisions, as well as limited floor space at retailers. we believe we have been successful in this area because of the relationships we have developed and as a result of the strong sales of our products. however, if retailers earn higher margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. we believe we have been able to compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our products and our selective distribution policies. we also believe our focused gearline merchandising story differentiates us from our competition. in the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and expect that we may face greater competition on pricing. this may favor larger competitors with lower production costs per unit that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. the purchasing decisions of consumers for our products often reflect highly subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements and changing styles. employees as of december 31, 2016 , we had approximately 15,200 employees, including approximately 9,400 in our brand and factory house stores and approximately 2,000 at our distribution facilities. approximately 6,500 of our employees were full-time. most of our employees are located in the united states. none of our employees in the united states are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there are no material collective bargaining agreements in effect in any of our international locations. we have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. available information we will make available free of charge on or through our website at www.underarmour.com our annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these materials with the securities and exchange commission. we also post on this website our key corporate governance documents, including our board committee charters, our corporate governance guidelines and our code of conduct and ethics. 7 table of contents item 1a. risk

in general economic or market conditions that could affect overall consumer spending or our industry; changes to the financial health of our customers; our ability to effectively manage our growth and a more complex global business; our ability to comply with existing trade and other regulations, and the potential impact of new trade and tax regulations on our profitability; our ability to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments or capital expenditures; our ability to effectively develop and launch new, innovative and updated products; our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands; increased competition causing us to lose market share or reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts; fluctuations in the costs of our products; loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, including due to port disruptions; our ability to further expand our business globally and to drive brand awareness and consumer acceptance of our products in other countries; our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results; risks related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to effectively market and maintain a positive brand image; the availability, integration and effective operation of information systems and other technology, as well as any potential interruption of such systems or technology; risks related to data security or privacy breaches; our ability to raise additional capital required to grow our business on terms acceptable to us; our potential exposure to litigation and other proceedings; and our ability to attract key talent and retain the services of our senior management and key employees. 8 table of contents the forward-looking statements contained in this form 10-k reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date of this form 10-k. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in north america, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2016 , sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 65% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. in 2016 , approximately 10% of our net revenues were generated from sales to our largest customer. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with this customer or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to sustain similar net revenue growth. we must continue to effectively manage our growth and the increased complexity of a global business or we may not achieve our long-term growth targets and our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $4,825.3 million in 2016 from $1,834.9 million in 2012. our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to not only maintain strong growth throughout our business, but to also successfully execute on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. our ability to invest in these growth initiatives in the near- 9 table of contents term also depends on our ability to maintain net revenue growth in north america (our largest market), which represented 83% of our total net revenues in 2016 . if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. in addition to successfully executing on our long-term growth strategies, we must also continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees, and obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. for example, as part of our ongoing business strategy we have engaged in acquisitions to grow and enhance our connected fitness business. in order to successfully execute this strategy, we must manage the integration of acquired companies and employees successfully. because our connected fitness business is a relatively new line of business for us, these challenges may be more pronounced. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. failing to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or to produce results consistent with financial models used in the analysis of our acquisitions could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. in addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of users, maintain or increase user engagement or ultimately realize expected revenues from our connected fitness community. for example, we may not successfully increase sales of our apparel, footwear and accessory products to these users. any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline. in addition, if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems. our failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season, during the last two quarters of the year. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. 10 table of contents factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability. sales of performance products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and 11 table of contents engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2016 , 10 manufacturers produced approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and three manufacturers produced approximately 70% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. 12 table of contents labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2016 , 83% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in markets outside of north america. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2016 , our products were manufactured by 39 primary manufacturers, operating in 18 countries, with 10 manufacturers accounting for approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and three manufacturers accounting for approximately 70% of our footwear products. approximately 60% of our apparel and accessories products were manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials, hamper our ability to sell products in international markets and increase our cost of doing business generally. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. our credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility. the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in 13 table of contents addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. although we currently generate 80% of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. 14 table of contents the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our ability to achieve our growth targets could be impacted if negative publicity diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct. we do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. as a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could harm our brand as well as our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity 15 table of contents is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could negatively impact our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data, particularly with respect to our connected fitness business. compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. we are in the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes, which began in 2015 and will continue in phases over the next several years. we plan to substantially complete the migration of our north america, emea and connected fitness operations to this system during 2017, and are in the process of developing an implementation strategy and roll-out plan for our asia-pacific and latin american regions. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design or implementation of these 16 table of contents systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-us earnings for which we have not previously provided for u.s. taxes. many of the countries in which we do business have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as result of the base erosion and profit shifting final proposals from the organization for economic co-operation and development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. in addition, significant tax law changes are being evaluated by the federal government of the united states, our most significant country of operation. such tax law changes, if enacted, could materially increase our tax obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments in our connected fitness business. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, 17 table of contents marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, particularly in our connected fitness business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are subject to periodic claims and litigation that could result in unexpected expenses and could ultimately be resolved against us . from time to time, we are involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. any of these proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. although we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and our brand image. the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time . the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our class c common stock has traded at a discount to and with less liquidity than our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. 18 table of contents kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding and in other limited circumstances. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. item 1b. unresolved staff comments not applicable. 19 table of contents item 2. properties the following includes a summary of the principal properties that we own or lease as of december 31, 2016 . our principal executive and administrative offices are located at an office complex in baltimore, maryland, which includes 400 thousand square feet of office space that we own and 126 thousand square feet that we are leasing. in 2016, we purchased buildings and parcels of land, including approximately 58 acres of land and 130 thousand square feet of office space, to be utilized to expand our corporate headquarters to accommodate our growth needs. for our european headquarters, we lease an office in amsterdam, the netherlands, and we maintain an international management office in panama. additionally, we lease space in austin, texas, denver, colorado, san francisco, california and copenhagen, denmark for our connected fitness businesses. we lease our primary distribution facilities, which are located in glen burnie, maryland, mount juliet, tennessee and rialto, california. our glen burnie facilities include a total of 830 thousand square feet, with options to renew various portions of the facilities through september 2021. our mount juliet facility is a 1.0 million square foot facility, with options to renew the lease term through december 2041. our rialto facility is a 1.2 million square foot facility with a lease term through may 2023. in 2016 we entered into a lease for a new 1.3 million square foot distribution facility being developed for us in baltimore, maryland, which we expect to utilize beginning in 2018. the lease for this property includes options to renew through 2053. we believe our distribution facilities and space available through our third-party logistics providers will be adequate to meet our short term needs. in addition, as of december 31, 2016 , we leased 241 brand and factory house stores located primarily in the united states, brazil, canada, china, chile and mexico with lease end dates in 2017 through 2033 . we also lease additional office space for sales, quality assurance and sourcing, marketing, and administrative functions. we anticipate that we will be able to extend these leases that expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to other locations. item 3. legal proceedings from time to time, we have been involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for information on certain legal proceedings, which is incorporated by reference herein. 20 table of contents executive officers of the registrant our executive officers are: name age position kevin a.

contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this form 10-k under the captions risk factors, selected financial data, and business. overview we are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. the brand's moisture-wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. the under armour connected fitness platform powers the world's largest digital health and fitness community and our strategy is focused on engaging with these consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our products. we plan to grow this community by developing innovative applications, services and other digital solutions to impact how athletes and fitness-minded individuals train, perform and live. our net revenues grew to $4,825.3 million in 2016 from $1,834.9 million in 2012 . we believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the under armour brand in the marketplace. we plan to continue to increase our net revenues over the long term by increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution sales channel, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets and engaging with consumers through our connected fitness business. financial highlights for full year 2016 include: net revenues increased 22% compared to 2015 . wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues increased 19% and 27% , respectively. apparel revenue increased 15% compared to the prior year, with footwear and accessories revenue increasing 49% and 17% , respectively. revenue in our north america segment grew 16% . revenue in our asia-pacific, emea and latin america segments grew 85% , 63% and 34% , respectively, with 51% growth in our connected fitness segment. selling, general and administrative expense increased 22% when compared to 2015 . gross margin decreased 170 basis points when compared to 2015 . a large majority of our products are sold in north america; however, we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. internationally, our net revenues are generated from a mix of wholesale sales to retailers, sales to distributors and sales through our direct to consumer sales channels in europe, latin america, and asia-pacific. in addition, a third party licensee sells our products in japan. we believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle. we believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. we also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non-performance products to performance products, which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin, helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort. we believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the united states, but are occurring in a number of markets globally, thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth, we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities, including, among others, the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers. in the fourth quarter of 2016, our growth was challenged due to the disruption of the north american retail environment. in addition, we expect our operating income in 2017 to decline compared to 2016. as such, we are in the process of evaluating our cost structure, and are making strategic resource allocation and prioritization decisions during 2017. these initiatives could impact our results of operations. in addition, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and a more complex global business. we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner. furthermore, our industry is very competitive, and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability. we 27 table of contents also rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers outside the u.s. to provide fabrics and to produce our products, and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business. for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a. general net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and connected fitness revenues. net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us by our licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on their products. our connected fitness revenues consist of digital advertising, digital fitness platform licenses and subscriptions from our connected fitness business. cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. the fabrics in many of our products are made primarily of petroleum-based synthetic materials. therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. in general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear. a limited portion of cost of goods sold is associated with license and connected fitness revenues, primarily website hosting costs. we include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. as a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. these costs were $89.9 million , $63.7 million and $55.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services. beginning in 2015, we consolidated our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other. the other category is the sum of our previously outlined selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services categories. personnel costs are included in these categories based on the employees' function. personnel costs include salaries, benefits, incentives and stock-based compensation related to our employees. our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth. marketing costs consist primarily of commercials, print ads, league, team, player and event sponsorships and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture program. other expense, net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries. 28 table of contents results of operations the following table

higher sales of our licensed products. gross profit increase d $335.1 million to $2,240.6 million in 2016 from $1,905.5 million in 2015 . gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decrease d 170 basis points to 46.4% in 2016 compared to 48.1% in 2015 . the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following: approximate 120 basis point decrease due to increased liquidation and discounting, which we expect to continue through 2017 on a more limited basis; approximate 70 basis point decrease driven by negative sales mix primarily driven by the continued strength of our accelerated footwear growth, which we expect to continue through 2017 on a more limited basis; and approximate 40 basis point decrease due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar negatively impacting our gross margins within our business outside the united states, which we expect to continue through 2017 on a more limited basis. the above decreases were partially offset by: approximate 30 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable product input costs in our north america and international businesses, which we expect to continue through 2017; and approximate 40 basis point increase driven primarily by lower air freight costs, which we do not expect to continue through 2017. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $326.1 million to $1,823.1 million in 2016 from $1,497.0 million in 2015 . as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent at 37.8% in 2016 and in 2015 . selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following: marketing costs increased $59.7 million to $477.5 million in 2016 from $ 417.8 million in 2015 . this increase was primarily due to key north american retail marketing campaigns, our investments in sponsorships and increased marketing in connection with the growth of our international business. this increase was offset by lower incentive compensation expense for marketing employees. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 9.9% in 2016 from 10.5% in 2015 . 30 table of contents other costs increased $266.4 million to $1,345.6 million in 2016 from $1,079.2 million in 2015 . this increase was primarily due to $17.0 million in expenses primarily related to the liquidation of the sports authority, comprised of $15.2 million in bad debt expense and $1.8 million of in-store fixture impairment. in addition, this increase was driven by higher personnel and other costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel, including increased investment for our factory house and brand house stores. this increase was offset by lower incentive compensation expense. as a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 27.9% in 2016 from 27.2% in 2015 . income from operations increase d $8.9 million , or 2.2% , to $417.5 million in 2016 from $ 408.5 million in 2015 . income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 8.6% in 2016 from 10.3% in 2015 . interest expense, net increase d $11.8 million to $ 26.4 million in 2016 from $ 14.6 million in 2015 . this increase was primarily due to interest on the net increase of $284.2 million in total debt outstanding. other expense, net decreased $4.4 million to $2.8 million in 2016 from $7.2 million in 2015 . this decrease was due to higher net gains on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and our derivative financial instruments as compared to the prior period. provision for income taxes decreased $22.8 million to $131.3 million in 2016 from $154.1 million in 2015 . our effective tax rate was 33.8% in 2016 compared to 39.9% in 2015 . our effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2015 primarily due to increased international profitability and a tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. we expect a full year 2017 effective tax rate of approximately 32% to 34%. due to the magnitude of discrete items, we expect a negative effective tax rate of approximately (6.0)% to (8.0)% in the first half of 2017, before normalizing in the third and fourth quarters. in addition, due to our required adoption of accounting standards update ("asu") 2016-09, our interim and full year tax rates may be impacted by significant employee stock option exercises, which we are unable to predict. see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of asu 2016-09. year ended december 31, 2015 compared to year ended december 31, 2014 net revenues increased $878.9 million, or 28.5%, to $3,963.3 million in 2015 from $3,084.4 million in 2014. net revenues by product category are

by running and basketball and the expansion of our footwear offerings internationally. license revenues increased $17.0 million, or 25.3%, to $84.2 million in 2015 from $67.2 million in 2014. this increase in license revenues was driven primarily by increased distribution of our licensed products in north america and japan. connected fitness revenue increased $34.2 million, or 177.8%, to $53.4 million in 2015 from $19.2 million in 2014 primarily driven by our connected fitness acquisitions in the first quarter of 2015 and revenue growth in our existing connected fitness business. gross profit increased $393.3 million to $1,905.5 million in 2015 from $1,512.2 million in 2014. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decreased 90 basis points to 48.1% in 2015 compared to 49.0% in 2014. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following: approximate 70 basis point decrease due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar negatively impacting our gross margins within our businesses outside the united states; 31 table of contents approximate 30 basis point decrease driven by higher inbound airfreight costs necessary to service our customers; approximate 30 basis point decrease driven by sales mix in north america; and approximate 20 basis point decrease driven by higher liquidation in both footwear and apparel. the above increases were partially offset by: approximate 60 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable product input costs in our north america and international businesses. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $338.7 million to $1,497.0 million in 2015 from $1,158.3 million in 2014. as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 37.8% in 2015 from 37.5% in 2014. these changes were primarily attributable to the following: marketing costs increased $84.8 million to $417.8 million in 2015 from $333.0 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to key marketing campaigns and investments in sponsorships. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 10.5% in 2015 from 10.8% in 2014. other costs increased $253.9 million to $1,079.2 million in 2015 from $825.3 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel, including increased investments for our brand house stores. this increase is also due to additional investments in our connected fitness business. as a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 27.2% in 2015 from 26.8% in 2014. income from operations increased $54.5 million, or 15.4%, to $408.5 million in 2015 from $354.0 million in 2014. income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 10.3% in 2015 from 11.5% in 2014. interest expense, net increased $9.3 million to $14.6 million in 2015 from $5.3 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to higher term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings during 2015 primarily used to finance our two connected fitness acquisitions. other expense, net increased $0.8 million to $7.2 million in 2015 from $6.4 million in 2014. this increase was due to higher net losses on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and our foreign currency derivative financial instruments in 2015. provision for income taxes increased $19.9 million to $154.1 million in 2015 from $134.2 million in 2014. our effective tax rate was 39.9% in 2015 compared to 39.2% in 2014. our effective tax rate for 2015 was higher than the effective tax rate for 2014 primarily due to increased non-deductible costs incurred in connection with our connected fitness acquisitions in 2015. 32 table of contents segment results of operations the net revenues and operating income (loss) associated with our segments are summarized in the following tables. the majority of corporate expenses within north america have not been allocated to our other segments. intersegment revenue is generated by connected fitness which runs advertising campaigns for other segments. due to the individual materiality of our asia-pacific segment, we have separately presented our asia-pacific, emea and latin america segments, as of december 31, 2016, and will no longer combine these segments for presentation purposes. net revenues and operating income by segment presented for prior periods has been conformed to the current presentation. during 2017, we plan to separately disclose our unallocated corporate costs. we believe this presentation will provide the users of our financial statements with increased transparency and comparability of our operating results. year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015 net revenues by segment are summarized below: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 $ change % change north

increases in revenue discussed above in the consolidated results of operations. operating income in our emea operating segment increased $8.3 million to $11.4 million in 2016 from $3.1 million in 2015 primarily due to sales growth discussed above and reductions in incentive compensation. this increase was offset by investments in sports marketing and infrastructure for future growth. operating income in our asia-pacific operating segment increased $31.9 million to $68.3 million in 2016 from $36.4 million in 2015 primarily due to sales growth discussed above and reductions in incentive

million in 2014 primarily due to investments to support growth in our connected fitness business, including the impact of our two connected fitness acquisitions in 2015. these acquisitions contributed $23.6 million to the operating loss for the connected fitness segment in 2015. 35 table of contents seasonality historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher priced cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. seasonality could have an impact on the timing of accruals if the sales in the last two quarters of the year do not materialize. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. the following table sets forth certain financial information for the periods indicated. the data is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. all recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below: quarter ended (unaudited) (in

estimate, we reversed $48.0 million of incentive compensation accruals. financial position, capital resources and liquidity our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. we fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowings available under our credit and long term debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities. our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the back half of the year. our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our new brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. these systems and processes are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments and our ability to access the capital markets are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, an economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity (refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a). in addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all. at december 31, 2016 , $122.9 million , or approximately 49.1% , of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries where a repatriation of those funds to the united states would likely result in an additional tax expense. however, based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations, as well as the status of current tax law, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states. in addition, our united states operations do not require the repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs. should we require additional capital in the united states, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states. if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits. determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practical. cash flows the following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented: 36 table of contents year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 2014 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $ 304,487 $ (44,104 ) $ 219,033 investing activities (381,139 ) (847,475 ) (152,312 ) financing activities 205,995 440,078 182,306 effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (8,725 ) (11,822 ) (3,341 ) net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 120,618 $ (463,323 ) $ 245,686 operating activities operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. in addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses. cash flows provided by operating activities increased $348.6 million to $304.5 million in 2016 from $44.1 million of cash used in operating activities in 2015 . the increase in cash from operating activities was due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $323.1 million , an increase in net income of $24.4 million year over year and an increase in adjustments to net income for non-cash items of $1.1 million year over year. the increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following: an increase in accounts payable of $225.0 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 , primarily due to the timing of inventory payments as well as significant increases in inventory in-transit in the current period, and a decrease in inventory investments of $130.5 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 , primarily due to early deliveries of product to meet key seasonal floor set dates in the prior period, as well as strategic investments in auto-replenishment products in 2015 ; partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable of $58.0 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 , primarily due to the timing of shipments and a higher proportion of sales to our international customers with longer payment terms compared to the prior year. cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $263.1 million to $44.1 million of cash used by operating activities in 2015 from $219.0 million of cash provided by operating activities in 2014. the decrease in cash from operating activities was due to decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $370.1 million, partially offset by adjustments to net income for non-cash items, which increased $82.5 million, and an increase in net income of $24.5 million year over year. the decrease in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following: an increase in inventory investments of $193.9 million primarily due to early deliveries of product to meet key seasonal floor set dates, as well as strategic investments in auto-replenishment products, and a larger increase in accounts receivable of $90.8 million in 2015 as compared to 2014, primarily due to the timing of shipments. 37 table of contents investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased $466.4 million to $381.1 million in 2016 from $ 847.5 million in 2015 , primarily due to the impact of our connected fitness acquisitions of myfitnesspal and endomondo which occurred during the first quarter of 2015 . cash used in investing activities increased $695.2 million to $847.5 million in 2015 from $152.3 million in 2014, primarily due to our connected fitness acquisitions of myfitnesspal and endomondo during the first quarter of 2015 and increased capital expenditures to improve and expand our corporate headquarters and invest in our new and expanding sap platform in 2015. total capital expenditures were $405.5 million, $325.5 million and $145.4 million in 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. capital expenditures for 2017 are expected to be approximately $400.0 million, comprised primarily of investments in our global offices around the world including our headquarters in baltimore, our distribution centers, our sap platform, and global direct-to-consumer. financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased $234.1 million to $ 206.0 million in 2016 from $ 440.1 million in 2015 . this decrease was primarily due to higher repayments on our revolving credit facility in the current period compared to the prior period, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in 2016 . cash provided by financing activities increased $257.8 million to $440.1 million in 2015 from $182.3 million in 2014. this increase was primarily due to our amended credit agreement that provided an additional $650.0 million in term loan and revolving credit facility proceeds in 2015 offset by payments of $261.3 million. credit facility we are party to a credit agreement that provides revolving commitments for up to $1.25 billion of borrowings, as well as term loan commitments, in each case maturing in january 2021. as of december 31, 2016 there was no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and $186.3 million of term loan borrowings remained outstanding. at our request and the lender's consent, revolving and or term loan borrowings may be increased by up to $300.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, as amended. incremental borrowings are uncommitted and the availability thereof, will depend on market conditions at the time we seek to incur such borrowings. the borrowings under the revolving credit facility have maturities of less than one year. up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. there were $2.6 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2016 . the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge our assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. we are also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00 and are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 ("consolidated leverage ratio"). as of december 31, 2016 , we were in compliance with these ratios. in addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made ( adjusted libor ), plus in each case an applicable margin. the applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the pricing grid ) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between 1.00% to 1.25% for adjusted libor loans and 0.00% to 0.25% for alternate base rate loans. the weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings was 1.6% and 1.3% during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. we pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit. as of december 31, 2016 , the commitment fee was 15.0 basis points. since inception, we have incurred and deferred $3.9 million in financing costs in connection with the credit agreement. 38 table of contents 3.250% senior notes in june 2016, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due june 15, 2026 (the notes ). the proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. interest is payable semi-annually on june 15 and december 15 beginning december 15, 2016. prior to march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or a make-whole amount applicable to such notes as described in the indenture governing the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. on or after march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. the indenture governing the notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture. we incurred and deferred $5.3 million in financing costs in connection with the notes. other long term debt in december 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising our corporate headquarters. the loan has a seven year term and maturity date of december 2019. the loan bears interest at one month libor plus a margin of 1.50% , and allows for prepayment without penalty. the loan includes covenants and events of default substantially consistent with our credit agreement discussed above. the loan also requires prior approval of the lender for certain matters related to the property, including transfers of any interest in the property. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , the outstanding balance on the loan was $42.0 million and $44.0 million , respectively. the weighted average interest rate on the loan was 2.0% and 1.7% for the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. interest expense, net was $26.4 million , $14.6 million , and $5.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities. amortization of deferred financing costs was $1.2 million , $0.8 million , and $0.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2016 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively. we monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities. contractual commitments and contingencies we lease warehouse space, office facilities, space for our brand and factory house stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. the leases expire at various dates through 2033, excluding extensions at our option, and include provisions for rental adjustments. in addition, this table includes executed lease agreements for brand and factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of december 31, 2016. the operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time. our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2016 as well as significant agreements entered into during the period after december 31, 2016 through the date of this report are summarized in the following table: payments due by period (in thousands) total less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years more than 5 years contractual obligations long term debt obligations (1) $ 1,031,737 $ 52,211 $ 138,547 $ 153,229 $ 687,750 lease obligations (2) 1,422,426 114,857 263,544 255,845 788,180 product purchase obligations (3) 684,511 684,262 249 sponsorships and other (4) 1,355,605 176,138 309,948 243,024 626,495 total $ 4,494,279 $ 1,027,468 $ 712,288 $ 652,098 $ 2,102,425 (1) includes estimated interest payments based on applicable fixed and currently effective floating interest rates as of december 31, 2016 , timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations. (2) includes the minimum payments for lease obligations. the lease obligations do not include any contingent rent expense we may incur at our brand and factory house stores based on future sales above a specified minimum or payments made for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. contingent rent expense was $13.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2016 . (3) we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales. the amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders with our manufacturers for our apparel, footwear and accessories, including expected inbound freight, duties and other costs. these open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable prices. the product purchase obligations also includes fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of december 31, 2016 . 39 table of contents (4) includes sponsorships with professional teams, professional leagues, colleges and universities, individual athletes, athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our brand. some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations. it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. the amount of product provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. in addition, it is not possible to determine the performance incentive amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based and other variables. the amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these sponsorship agreements. additionally, these amounts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments to endorsers and licensors based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. the table above excludes a liability of $69.5 million for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions. off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad faith. based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. to prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. we believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements. the sec suggests companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. it is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended december 31, 2016 . 40 table of contents revenue recognition net revenues consist of both net sales and license and other revenues. net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. transfer of title and risk of loss are based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. in some instances, transfer of title and risk of loss take place at the point of sale, for example at our brand and factory house stores. we may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. license revenues are primarily recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees. sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis on the consolidated statements of income and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold. we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. the actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. if we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination. provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers. reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable as settlements are made through offsets to outstanding customer invoices. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , there were $146.2 million and $94.5 million , respectively, in reserves for customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. in determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates. if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. in the event we determine a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination was made. as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , the allowance for doubtful accounts was $11.3 million and $5.9 million , respectively. inventory valuation and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods. costs of finished goods inventories include all costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including inbound freight, duties and other costs. we value our inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or market. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those that we projected , further adjustments may be required that would increase the cost of goods sold in the period in which such a determination was made. goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are allocated to the reporting units that are expected to receive the related benefits. goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. in conducting an annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if factors indicate that is the case, or if goodwill is allocated to a reporting unit for the first time, we perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. the first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. we calculate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, which indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business, and working 41 table of contents capital effects. if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, the second step will be performed. the second step, measuring the impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. we perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. as of december 31, 2016, no impairment of goodwill was identified and the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value. the connected fitness valuation is dependent upon revenue growth assumptions. if the performance of this reporting unit does not meet expectations it could have a material impact on the fair value of the reporting unit. we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows. when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. if future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made. income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements. as of december 31, 2016 , we had $64.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. this unrecognized compensation expense does not include any expense related to performance-based restricted stock units and stock options for which the performance targets have not been achieved as of december 31, 2016 . the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. in addition, compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance targets are deemed probable, which requires management judgment. the achievement of certain operating income targets related to the performance-based restricted stock units and stock options granted in 2016 were not deemed probable as of december 31, 2016 . additional stock-based compensation of up to $20.0 million would have been recorded from grant date through 2016 for these performance-based restricted stock units and stock options had the full achievement of all operating targets been deemed probable; however, currently we do not believe that these targets will be met. as a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. refer to note 2 and note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock-based compensation. recently issued accounting standards refer to note 2 to the notes to our financial statements included in this form 10-k for our assessment of recently issued accounting standards. 42 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk 43 table of contents we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. as our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, as we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. from time to time, we may elect to use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations primarily on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our international subsidiaries. as we expand our international business, we anticipate expanding our current hedging program to include additional currency pairs and instruments. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. as of december 31, 2016 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts was $845.1 million , which was comprised of canadian dollar/u.s. dollar, euro/u.s. dollar, mexican peso/u.s. dollar, yen/euro, mexican peso/euro and pound sterling/euro currency pairs with contract maturities of one to eleven months. the majority of our foreign currency contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. during 2014, we began entering into foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. for foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, excluding any ineffective portion, is recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged transaction. the effective portion is generally released to net income after the maturity of the related derivative and is classified in the same manner as the underlying exposure. during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 , we reclassified $0.3 million and $3.5 million from other comprehensive income to cost of goods sold related to foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, respectively. the fair values of the company's foreign currency contracts were assets of $15.2 million and $3.8 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2016 2015 2014 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ (12,627 ) $ (33,359 ) $ (11,739 ) realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) (6,906 ) 7,643 2,247 unrealized derivative gains 729 388 1 realized derivative gains 15,192 16,404 3,081 we enter into foreign currency contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk i n order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. we utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. the contracts pay fixed and receive variable rates of interest. the interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation . as of december 31, 2016 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts was $153.1 million . during the years ended december 31, 2016 and 2015 , we recorded a $2.0 million and $2.7 million 44 table of contents increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contracts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of $0.4 million and $1.5 million as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. credit risk w e are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2016 . see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies and estimates - allowance for doubtful accounts." inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in recent periods, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 45 table of contentsrisk

conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in north america, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2017 , sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 61% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. we generate a significant portion of our wholesale revenues from sales to our largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with our key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation, particularly in the sports specialty sector. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to continue to grow our net revenues, or our net revenues may decline. we may not successfully execute our long-term strategies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. 9 table of contents our ability to execute on our long-term strategies depends, in part, on successfully executing on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. our ability to continue to invest in these growth initiatives in the near-term may be negatively impacted by the performance of our north america business, which represented 77% of our total net revenues in 2017 but declined by 5% over 2016 , and in particular the performance of our wholesale channel in north america. our ability to execute on our long-term strategy also depends on our ability to successfully manage our cost structure and drive return on our investments. if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we may not fully realize the expected benefits of any restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability. we have recently announced restructuring plans designed to more closely align our financial resources against the critical priorities of our business. these plans have included initiatives to improve operational efficiencies, and our 2017 restructuring plan included a reduction in our global workforce. we may not achieve our targeted operational improvements and efficiencies, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements and/or cost reductions. these risks include, among others, higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans, damage to our reputation and brand image and workforce attrition beyond planned reductions. if we fail to achieve targeted operating improvements and/or cost reductions, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted and we may be required to implement additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. we must successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business, or our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $4,976.6 million in 2017 from $2,332.1 million in 2013. we must continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees, and obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences, successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products or engage our consumers, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products or design products in the categories and styles that consumers want, demand for our products could decline and our brand image could be negatively impacted. our 10 table of contents failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. in addition, if we experience problems with the quality of our products, our brand reputation may be negatively impacted and we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems, which could negatively impact our results of operations. in addition, consumer preferences regarding the shopping experience continue to rapidly evolve. if we or our wholesale customers do not provide consumers with an attractive in-store experience, or if we do not continue to provide an engaging and user-friendly digital commerce platform that attracts consumers, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during the last two quarters of the year, which historically has been our peak season. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results. sales of performance products may not continue to grow or may decline, which could negatively impact our sales and our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow or rather decline, our sales could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected financial results. in addition, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. 11 table of contents the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in products similar to ours and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies has been to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers have better sell through or earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could negatively impact our brand image. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide raw materials for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are 12 table of contents manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2017 , 10 manufacturers produced approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and five produced approximately 83% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2017 , 77% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices in certain regions outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in those markets. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources and may be more costly than we expect. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of more limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2017 , our products were manufactured by 39 primary manufacturers, operating in 17 countries, with 10 manufacturers accounting for approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and five produced approximately 83% of our footwear products. approximately 61% of our apparel and accessories products were manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; 13 table of contents the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials, hamper our ability to sell products in international markets and increase our cost of doing business generally. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. failing to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or to produce results consistent with financial models used in the analysis of our acquisitions could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. our credit agreement contains financial covenants, and both our credit agreement and debt securities contain other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. our debt securities limit our ability to, subject to certain significant exceptions, incur secured debt and engage in sale leaseback transactions. our credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. in february 2018, we amended our credit agreement to increase our permitted leverage ratio during certain quarters in 2018. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement or our debt securities could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations (including our debt securities) will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. our debt securities include a cross acceleration provision which provides that the acceleration of certain other debt obligations (including our credit agreement) will be considered an event of default under our debt securities and, subject to certain time and notice periods, give bondholders the right to accelerate our debt securities. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and 14 table of contents outlook. our credit ratings have been downgraded previously, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. we generated approximately 27% of our consolidated net revenues outside the united states. as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our business could be negatively impacted if publicity diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, while we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct, we do not control their practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. these and other types of negative publicity, especially through social media which potentially accelerates and increases the scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact our brand image and result in diminished loyalty to our brand. this could have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations. 15 table of contents sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and disrupt our ability to conduct our business, as well as damage our brand image with consumers. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant unanticipated compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by severe weather conditions, floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our results of operations, as well as our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any 16 table of contents significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could have a materially adverse impact on our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications, and these systems face similar risk of interruption or attack. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. we also rely on third parties for the operation of certain of our e-commerce websites, and do not control these service providers. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could negatively impact our results of operations. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data. compliance with existing, proposed and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. this could negatively impact our profitability, result in negative publicity and damage our brand image or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. we are in the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes, which began in 2015 and will continue in phases over the next several years. the first phase of this implementation became operational during 2017 in our north america, emea and connected fitness operations, and we are in the process of developing an implementation strategy and roll-out plan for our asia-pacific and latin american regions. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-u.s. earnings for which we have not previously provided for applicable withholding tax, u.s. state income taxes, or foreign exchange rate impacts. many of the countries in which we do business have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as result of the base erosion and profit shifting final 17 table of contents proposals from the organization for economic co-operation and development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017, which had a significant impact to our provision for income taxes as of december 31, 2017. the tax act includes a number of changes to existing u.s. tax laws that impact us, including the reduction of the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017. the tax act also provides for a one-time transition tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including the elimination of certain domestic deductions and credits, capitalization of research and development expenditures, and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and interest. the tax act transitions u.s. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-u.s. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to u.s. taxation. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. as we complete our analysis of the tax act, review all information, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments to support our digital strategy. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to profitably grow our business and manage our operations, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business and achieve our long term objectives. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. 18 table of contents the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, including our digital business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are subject to periodic claims, litigation and investigations that could result in unexpected expenses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . given the size and extent of our global operations, we are involved in a variety of litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, audits, inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities, class action and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry. these matters include those contained in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. any of our legal proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and our brand image. 19 table of contents the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time . the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our non-voting class c common stock has traded at a discount to our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding and in other limited circumstances. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. quantitative and

activities are the development, marketing and distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. the brand's performance apparel and footwear are engineered in many designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and are worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. our net revenues are generated primarily from the wholesale sales of our products to national, regional, independent and specialty retailers and distributors. we also generate net revenue from the sale of our products through our direct to consumer sales channel, which includes our brand and factory house stores and websites, from product licensing and from digital platform licensing and subscriptions and digital advertising through our connected fitness business. a large majority of our products are sold in north america; however we believe that our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. internationally, our net revenues are generated from a mix of wholesale sales to retailers and distributors and sales through our direct to consumer sales channels, and license revenue from sales by our third party licensees. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. our digital strategy is focused on supporting these long term objectives, emphasizing connecting and engaging with our consumers through multiple digital touch points, including through our connected fitness business. we were incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1996. as used in this report, the terms we, our, us, under armour and the company refer to under armour, inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. we have registered trademarks around the globe, including under armour , heatgear , coldgear , allseasongear and the under armour ua logo, and we have applied to register many other trademarks. this annual report on form 10-k also contains additional trademarks and tradenames of our company and our subsidiaries. all trademarks and tradenames appearing in this annual report on form 10-k are the property of their respective holders. products our product offerings consist of apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. we market our products at multiple price levels and provide consumers with products that we believe are a superior alternative to traditional athletic products. in 2017 , sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 66% , 21% and 9% of net revenues, respectively. licensing arrangements, primarily for the sale of our products, and revenue from our connected fitness business represented the remaining 4% of net revenues. refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for net revenues by product. apparel our apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility, regulate body temperature and improve performance regardless of weather conditions. our apparel is engineered to replace traditional non-performance fabrics in the world of athletics and fitness with performance alternatives designed and merchandised along gearlines. our three gearlines are marketed to tell a very simple story about our highly technical products and extend across the sporting goods, outdoor and active lifestyle markets. we market our apparel for consumers to choose heatgear when it is hot, coldgear when it is cold and allseasongear between the extremes. within each gearline our apparel comes in three primary fit types: compression (tight fit), fitted (athletic fit) and loose (relaxed). heatgear is designed to be worn in warm to hot temperatures under equipment or as a single layer. while a sweat-soaked traditional non-performance t-shirt can weigh two to three pounds, heatgear is engineered with a microfiber blend designed to wick moisture from the body which helps the body stay cool, dry and light. we offer heatgear in a variety of tops and bottoms in a broad array of colors and styles for wear in the gym or outside in warm weather. coldgear is designed to wick moisture from the body while circulating body heat from hot spots to help maintain core body temperature. our coldgear apparel provides both dryness and warmth in a single light layer 1 table of contents that can be worn beneath a jersey, uniform, protective gear or ski-vest, and our coldgear outerwear products protect the athlete, as well as the coach and the fan from the outside in. our coldgear products generally sell at higher prices than our other gearlines. allseasongear is designed to be worn in between extreme temperatures and uses technical fabrics to keep the wearer cool and dry in warmer temperatures while preventing a chill in cooler temperatures. footwear our footwear offerings include running, basketball, cleated, slides and performance training, and outdoor footwear. our footwear is light, breathable and built with performance attributes for athletes. our footwear is designed with innovative technologies including ua hovr , anafoam , ua clutch fit and charged cushioning , which provide stabilization, directional cushioning and moisture management engineered to maximize the athlete's comfort and control. accessories accessories primarily includes the sale of athletic performance gloves, bags and headwear. our accessories include heatgear and coldgear technologies and are designed with advanced fabrications to provide the same level of performance as our other products. connected fitness we offer digital fitness subscriptions, along with digital advertising through our mapmyfitness, myfitnesspal and endomondo applications. license we have agreements with our licensees to develop under armour apparel, accessories and equipment. our product, marketing and sales teams are involved in substantially all steps of the design and go to market process in order to maintain brand standards and consistency. during 2017 , our licensees offered collegiate, national football league ("nfl), major league baseball ("mlb"), and national basketball association ( nba ) apparel and accessories, baby and kids' apparel, team uniforms, socks, water bottles, eyewear, phone and golf accessories and other specific hard goods equipment that feature performance advantages and functionality similar to our other product offerings. marketing and promotion we currently focus on marketing and selling our products to consumers primarily for use in athletics, fitness, training, outdoor activities and as part of an active lifestyle. we seek to drive consumer demand by building brand equity and awareness that our products deliver advantages to help athletes perform better. sports marketing our marketing and promotion strategy begins with providing and selling our products to high-performing athletes and teams on the high school, collegiate and professional levels. we execute this strategy through outfitting agreements, professional and collegiate sponsorships, individual athlete agreements and by providing and selling our products directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. we also seek to sponsor events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level by hosting combines, camps and clinics for young athletes in many sports at regional sites across the country. as a result, our products are seen on the field, giving them exposure to various consumer audiences through the internet, television, magazines and live at sporting events. this exposure to consumers helps us establish on-field authenticity as consumers can see our products being worn by high-performing athletes. we are the official outfitter of athletic teams in several high-profile collegiate conferences. we are an official supplier of footwear and gloves to the nfl. we are the official performance footwear supplier of mlb and a partner with the nba which allows us to market our nba athletes in game uniforms in connection with our basketball footwear. we are the official headwear and performance apparel provider for the nfl scouting combine and the official partner and title sponsor of the nba draft combine, in each case with the right to sell licensed combine training apparel and headwear. in 2016, we entered into an agreement to be the official on-field uniform supplier, official authentic performance apparel partner, and official connected fitness partner of mlb, now beginning with the 2019 season, which will allow us to provide on-field uniforms, apparel, and accessories to all thirty mlb clubs on an exclusive basis, and, together with our manufacturing partner sell a broad range of mlb licensed merchandise. internationally, we 2 table of contents sponsor and sell our products to several european and latin american soccer and rugby teams, which helps drive brand awareness in various countries and regions around the world. media we feature our products in a variety of national digital, broadcast, and print media outlets. we also utilize social and mobile media to engage consumers and promote connectivity with our brand and our products, and plan to increase our use of social media promotion in the future. for example, in 2017, we launched our first entirely digital marketing campaign for our "unlike any" women's campaign, which included a variety of content on various social media platforms. retail presentation the primary component of our retail marketing strategy is to increase brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. the design and funding of under armour concept shops within our major retail accounts has been a key initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our brand. under armour concept shops enhance our brand's presentation within our major retail accounts with a shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images. sales and distribution the majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels, which include national and regional sporting goods chains, independent and specialty retailers, department store chains, institutional athletic departments and leagues and teams. in addition, we sell our products to independent distributors in various countries where we generally do not have direct sales operations and through licensees. we also sell our products directly to consumers through our own network of brand and factory house stores in our north america, europe, the middle east and africa ( emea ), latin america and asia-pacific operating segments, and through websites globally. factory house stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing us to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products while maintaining the pricing integrity of our brand in our other distribution channels. through our brand house stores, consumers experience our brand first-hand and have broader access to our performance products. in 2017 , sales through our wholesale, direct to consumer, licensing and connected fitness channels represented 61% , 35% , 2% and 2% of net revenues, respectively. we believe the trend toward performance products is global and plan to continue to introduce our products and simple merchandising story to athletes throughout the world. we are introducing our performance apparel, footwear and accessories outside of north america in a manner consistent with our past brand-building strategy, including selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes in these markets, thereby providing us with product exposure to broad audiences of potential consumers. our primary business operates in four geographic segments: (1) north america, comprising the united states and canada, (2) emea, (3) asia-pacific, and (4) latin america. each of these geographic segments operate predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and distribution of performance apparel, footwear and accessories. we also operate our connected fitness business as a separate segment. the following table presents net revenues by segment for each of the years ending december 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 :

approximately 76.5% of our net revenues for 2017 . we sell our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in north america through our wholesale and direct to consumer channels. net revenues generated from the sales of our products in the united states were $3.6 billion , $3.8 billion and $3.3 billion for the years ended december 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 respectively. see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. no customers accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in 2017. our direct to consumer sales are generated through our brand and factory house stores and internet websites. as of december 31, 2017 , we had 162 factory house stores in north america primarily located in outlet centers throughout the united states. as of december 31, 2017 , we had 19 brand house stores in north america. consumers can purchase our products directly from our e-commerce website, www.underarmour.com. in addition, we earn licensing revenue in north america based on our licensees' sale of collegiate and league apparel and accessories, as well as sales of other licensed products. in order to maintain consistent quality and performance, we pre-approve all products manufactured and sold by our licensees, and our quality assurance team strives to ensure that the products meet the same quality and compliance standards as the products that we sell directly. we distribute the majority of our products sold to our north american wholesale customers and our brand and factory house stores from distribution facilities we lease and operate in california, maryland and tennessee. in addition, we distribute our products in north america through third-party logistics providers with primary locations in canada, new jersey and florida. in some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from the factories that manufacture our products directly to customer-designated facilities. international approximately 21.7% of our net revenues were generated from our international segments in 2017 . we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term in part through expansion in international markets. emea we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories primarily through wholesale customers, website operations, independent distributors and a limited number of stores we operate in certain european countries. we also sell our branded products to various sports clubs and teams in europe. we generally distribute our products to our retail customers and e-commerce consumers in europe through a third-party logistics provider. we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories through independent distributors in the middle east and africa. in 2017 we began selling our products to wholesale customers in russia. asia-pacific we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories products in china, south korea and australia through stores operated by our distribution and wholesale partners, along with website operations and stores we operate. we also sell our products to distributors in new zealand, taiwan, hong kong and other countries in southeast asia where we do not have direct sales operations. we distribute our products in asia-pacific primarily through a third-party logistics provider based out of hong kong. we have a license agreement with dome corporation, which produces, markets and sells our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in japan. our branded products are sold in japan to large sporting goods retailers, independent specialty stores and professional sports teams, and through licensee-owned retail stores. we hold a cost-based minority investment in dome. latin america we sell our products in mexico, chile, brazil and argentina through wholesale customers, website operations and brand and factory house stores. in these countries we operate through third-party distribution facilities. in other latin american countries we distribute our products through independent distributors which are sourced through our international distribution hubs in hong kong, jordan and panama. connected fitness in 2013, we began offering digital fitness subscriptions and licenses, along with digital advertising through our mapmyfitness platform. in 2015, we acquired the endomondo and myfitnesspal platforms to create our connected fitness business. approximately 1.8% of our net revenues were generated from our connected fitness business in 2017 . we plan to engage and grow this community by developing innovative services and other digital solutions to impact how athletes and fitness-minded individuals train, perform and live. 4 table of contents seasonality historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher priced cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. product design and development our products are manufactured with technical fabrications produced by third parties and developed in collaboration with our product development teams. this approach enables us to select and create superior, technically advanced fabrics, produced to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on design, fit, climate and product end use. we seek to regularly upgrade and improve our products with the latest in innovative technology while broadening our product offerings. our goal, to deliver superior performance in all our products, provides our developers and licensees with a clear, overarching direction for the brand and helps them identify new opportunities to create performance products that meet the changing needs of athletes. we design products with visible technology, utilizing color, texture and fabrication to enhance our customers' perception and understanding of product use and benefits. our product development team works closely with our sports marketing and sales teams as well as professional and collegiate athletes to identify product trends and determine market needs. for example, these teams worked closely to identify the opportunity and market for our coldgear infrared product, which is a ceramic print technology on the inside of our garments that provides athletes with lightweight warmth, and speedform , a proprietary 3-dimensional molding technology for footwear which delivers superior fit and feel. in 2017 we also opened our newest center for footwear performance innovation located in portland, oregon, bringing together footwear design and development teams into a centralized location. sourcing, manufacturing and quality assurance many of the specialty fabrics and other raw materials used in our apparel products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short term, from a limited number of sources. the fabric and other raw materials used to manufacture our apparel products are sourced by our contracted manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us. in 2017 , approximately 53% of the fabric used in our apparel products came from five suppliers. these fabric suppliers have primary locations in taiwan, malaysia and mexico. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. we also use cotton in our apparel products, as blended fabric and also in our charged cotton line. cotton is a commodity that is subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. additionally, our footwear uses raw materials that are sourced from a diverse base of third party suppliers. this includes chemicals and petroleum-based components such as rubber that are also subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers. in 2017 , our apparel and accessories products were manufactured by 39 primary contract manufacturers, operating in 17 countries, with approximately 61% of our apparel and accessories products manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. of our 39 primary contract manufacturers, 10 produced approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products. in 2017 , our footwear products were manufactured by seven primary contract manufacturers, operating primarily in vietnam, china and indonesia. of our seven primary contract manufacturers, five produced approximately 83% of our footwear products. all manufacturers across all product divisions are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our internal teams prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. we also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of goods sold. we enter into a variety of agreements with our contract manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing and working conditions and other social concerns. we do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term. we have subsidiaries strategically located near our key partners to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for our products. we also manufacture a limited number of products primarily for high- 5 table of contents profile athletes and teams, on-premises in our quick turn, special make-up shop located at one of our facilities in maryland. inventory management inventory management is important to the financial condition and operating results of our business. we manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. these systems and processes, including our new global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. our practice, and the general practice in the apparel, footwear and accessory industries, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. as it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. this can affect our inventory levels as we build pre-launch quantities. intellectual property we believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products, both domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. our major trademarks include the ua logo and under armour , both of which are registered in the united states, canada, mexico, the european union, japan, china and numerous other countries. we also own trademark registrations for other trademarks including, among others, ua , armour , heatgear , coldgear , allseasongear , protect this house , i will , and many trademarks that incorporate the term armour such as, armourstorm , armour fleece, and armour bra . we also own applications to protect connected fitness branding such as under armour connected fitness . we own domain names for our primary trademarks (most notably underarmour.com and ua.com) and hold copyright registrations for several commercials, as well as for certain artwork. we intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. we will continue to aggressively enforce our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally. we believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our products from those of others. these trademarks are among our most valuable assets. in addition to our distinctive trademarks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, and we believe our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace. we traditionally have had limited patent protection on much of the technology, materials and processes used in the manufacture of our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, particularly in our connected fitness business. as we continue to expand and drive innovation in our products, we expect to seek patent protection on products, features and concepts we believe to be strategic and important to our business. we will continue to strategically file patent applications where we deem appropriate to protect our new products, innovations and designs. we expect the number of applications to increase as our business grows and as we continue to expand our products and innovate. competition the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. many of the fabrics and technology used in manufacturing our products are not unique to us, and we own a limited number of fabric or process patents. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition and significantly greater resources than us, such as nike and adidas. we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in performance apparel and footwear, and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. in addition, we must compete with others for purchasing decisions, as well as limited floor space at retailers. we believe we have been successful in this area because of the relationships we have developed and as a result of the strong sales of our products. however, if retailers earn higher margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. 6 table of contents we believe we have been able to compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our products and our selective distribution policies. we also believe our focused gearline merchandising story differentiates us from our competition. in the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and expect that we may face greater competition on pricing. this may favor larger competitors with lower production costs per unit that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. the purchasing decisions of consumers for our products often reflect highly subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements and changing styles. employees as of december 31, 2017 , we had approximately 15,800 employees, including approximately 9,900 in our brand and factory house stores and approximately 1,500 at our distribution facilities. approximately 6,900 of our employees were full-time. most of our employees are located in the united states. none of our employees in the united states are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there are no material collective bargaining agreements in effect in any of our international locations. we have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. available information we will make

conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in north america, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2017 , sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 61% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. we generate a significant portion of our wholesale revenues from sales to our largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with our key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation, particularly in the sports specialty sector. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to continue to grow our net revenues, or our net revenues may decline. we may not successfully execute our long-term strategies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. 9 table of contents our ability to execute on our long-term strategies depends, in part, on successfully executing on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. our ability to continue to invest in these growth initiatives in the near-term may be negatively impacted by the performance of our north america business, which represented 77% of our total net revenues in 2017 but declined by 5% over 2016 , and in particular the performance of our wholesale channel in north america. our ability to execute on our long-term strategy also depends on our ability to successfully manage our cost structure and drive return on our investments. if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. we may not fully realize the expected benefits of any restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability. we have recently announced restructuring plans designed to more closely align our financial resources against the critical priorities of our business. these plans have included initiatives to improve operational efficiencies, and our 2017 restructuring plan included a reduction in our global workforce. we may not achieve our targeted operational improvements and efficiencies, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements and/or cost reductions. these risks include, among others, higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans, damage to our reputation and brand image and workforce attrition beyond planned reductions. if we fail to achieve targeted operating improvements and/or cost reductions, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted and we may be required to implement additional restructuring-related activities, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. we must successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business, or our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $4,976.6 million in 2017 from $2,332.1 million in 2013. we must continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees, and obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences, successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products or engage our consumers, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products or design products in the categories and styles that consumers want, demand for our products could decline and our brand image could be negatively impacted. our 10 table of contents failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. in addition, if we experience problems with the quality of our products, our brand reputation may be negatively impacted and we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems, which could negatively impact our results of operations. in addition, consumer preferences regarding the shopping experience continue to rapidly evolve. if we or our wholesale customers do not provide consumers with an attractive in-store experience, or if we do not continue to provide an engaging and user-friendly digital commerce platform that attracts consumers, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during the last two quarters of the year, which historically has been our peak season. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results. sales of performance products may not continue to grow or may decline, which could negatively impact our sales and our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow or rather decline, our sales could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected financial results. in addition, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. 11 table of contents the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in products similar to ours and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies has been to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers have better sell through or earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could negatively impact our brand image. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide raw materials for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are 12 table of contents manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2017 , 10 manufacturers produced approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and five produced approximately 83% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. our future growth depends in part on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2017 , 77% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices in certain regions outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in those markets. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources and may be more costly than we expect. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of more limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to develop new markets outside of north america will limit our opportunities for growth. the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business. in 2017 , our products were manufactured by 39 primary manufacturers, operating in 17 countries, with 10 manufacturers accounting for approximately 57% of our apparel and accessories products, and five produced approximately 83% of our footwear products. approximately 61% of our apparel and accessories products were manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. as a result of our international manufacturing, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations; 13 table of contents the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials, hamper our ability to sell products in international markets and increase our cost of doing business generally. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. in addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or other import limitations that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other markets. any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, it may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. failing to successfully integrate acquired entities and businesses or to produce results consistent with financial models used in the analysis of our acquisitions could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. our credit agreement contains financial covenants, and both our credit agreement and debt securities contain other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. our debt securities limit our ability to, subject to certain significant exceptions, incur secured debt and engage in sale leaseback transactions. our credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. in february 2018, we amended our credit agreement to increase our permitted leverage ratio during certain quarters in 2018. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement or our debt securities could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations (including our debt securities) will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. our debt securities include a cross acceleration provision which provides that the acceleration of certain other debt obligations (including our credit agreement) will be considered an event of default under our debt securities and, subject to certain time and notice periods, give bondholders the right to accelerate our debt securities. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and 14 table of contents outlook. our credit ratings have been downgraded previously, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. we generated approximately 27% of our consolidated net revenues outside the united states. as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our business could be negatively impacted if publicity diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, while we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct, we do not control their practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. these and other types of negative publicity, especially through social media which potentially accelerates and increases the scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact our brand image and result in diminished loyalty to our brand. this could have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations. 15 table of contents sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and disrupt our ability to conduct our business, as well as damage our brand image with consumers. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant unanticipated compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by severe weather conditions, floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our results of operations, as well as our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any 16 table of contents significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could have a materially adverse impact on our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications, and these systems face similar risk of interruption or attack. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. we also rely on third parties for the operation of certain of our e-commerce websites, and do not control these service providers. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could negatively impact our results of operations. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data. compliance with existing, proposed and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. this could negatively impact our profitability, result in negative publicity and damage our brand image or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. we are in the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes, which began in 2015 and will continue in phases over the next several years. the first phase of this implementation became operational during 2017 in our north america, emea and connected fitness operations, and we are in the process of developing an implementation strategy and roll-out plan for our asia-pacific and latin american regions. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-u.s. earnings for which we have not previously provided for applicable withholding tax, u.s. state income taxes, or foreign exchange rate impacts. many of the countries in which we do business have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as result of the base erosion and profit shifting final 17 table of contents proposals from the organization for economic co-operation and development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017, which had a significant impact to our provision for income taxes as of december 31, 2017. the tax act includes a number of changes to existing u.s. tax laws that impact us, including the reduction of the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after december 31, 2017. the tax act also provides for a one-time transition tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings and the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including the elimination of certain domestic deductions and credits, capitalization of research and development expenditures, and limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation and interest. the tax act transitions u.s. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-u.s. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to u.s. taxation. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. as we complete our analysis of the tax act, review all information, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments to support our digital strategy. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to profitably grow our business and manage our operations, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business and achieve our long term objectives. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. 18 table of contents the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, including our digital business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are subject to periodic claims, litigation and investigations that could result in unexpected expenses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . given the size and extent of our global operations, we are involved in a variety of litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, audits, inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities, class action and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry. these matters include those contained in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k. legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. any of our legal proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers and our brand image. 19 table of contents the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time . the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our non-voting class c common stock has traded at a discount to our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding and in other limited circumstances. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. item 1b. unresolved staff comments not applicable. 20 table of contents item 2. properties the following includes a summary of the principal properties that we own or lease as of december 31, 2017 . our principal executive and administrative offices are located at an office complex in baltimore, maryland, which includes 400 thousand square feet of office space that we own and 126 thousand square feet that we are leasing. in 2016, we purchased buildings and parcels of land, including approximately 58 acres of land and 130 thousand square feet of office space located close to our corporate office complex, to be utilized to expand our corporate headquarters to accommodate our future growth needs. for our european headquarters, we lease an office in amsterdam, the netherlands, and we maintain an international management office in panama. for our greater china headquarters, we lease an office in shanghai, china. additionally, we lease space in austin, texas, denver, colorado, san francisco, california and copenhagen, denmark for our connected fitness businesses. we lease our primary distribution facilities, which are located in glen burnie, maryland, mount juliet, tennessee and rialto, california. our glen burnie facilities include a total of 830 thousand square feet, with options to renew various portions of the facilities through september 2021. our mount juliet facility is a 1.0 million square foot facility, with options to renew the lease term through december 2041. our rialto facility is a 1.2 million square foot facility with a lease term through may 2023. in 2016 we entered into a lease for a new 1.3 million square foot distribution facility being developed for us in baltimore, maryland, which we expect to utilize beginning in 2019. the lease for this property includes options to renew through 2053. we believe our distribution facilities and space available through our third-party logistics providers will be adequate to meet our short term needs. in addition, as of december 31, 2017 , we leased 295 brand and factory house stores located primarily in the united states, brazil, canada, china, chile and mexico with lease end dates in 2018 through 2033 . we also lease additional office space for sales, quality assurance and sourcing, marketing, and administrative functions. we anticipate that we will be able to extend these leases that expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to other locations. item 3. legal proceedings from time to time, we have been involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information on

management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this form 10-k under the captions risk factors, selected financial data, and business. overview we are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. the brand's moisture-wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. the under armour connected fitness platform powers the world's largest digital health and fitness community and our strategy is focused on engaging with these consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our products. our net revenues grew to $4,976.6 million in 2017 from $2,332.1 million in 2013 . we believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the under armour brand in the marketplace. our long-term growth strategy is focused on increased sales of our products through ongoing product innovation, investment in our distribution channels and international expansion. while we plan to continue to invest in growth, we also plan to improve efficiencies throughout our business as we seek to gain scale through our operations and return on our investments. financial highlights for full year 2017 as compared to the prior year period include: net revenues increased 3% . wholesale revenue decreased 3% and direct-to-consumer revenues increased 14% . apparel, footwear and accessories revenue increased 2% , 3% and 10% , respectively. revenue in our north america segment decreased 5% . revenue in our asia-pacific, emea and latin america segments grew 61% , 42% and 28% , respectively, with 11% growth in our connected fitness segment. selling, general and administrative expense increased 14% . gross margin decreased 140 basis points. a large majority of our products are sold in north america; however, we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. internationally, our net revenues are generated from a mix of wholesale sales to retailers, sales to distributors and sales through our direct to consumer sales channels in europe, latin america, and asia-pacific. in addition, a third party licensee sells our products in japan. we believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle. we believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. we also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non-performance products to performance products, which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin, helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort. we believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the united states, but are occurring in a number of markets globally, thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth, we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities or negatively impact our financial results, including, among others, the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers. additionally, we may not be able to successfully execute on our long-term strategies, or successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business effectively. although we have announced restructuring plans, we may not fully realize the expected benefits of these plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives. in addition, we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner. furthermore, our industry is very competitive, and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability. we also rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers outside the u.s. to provide fabrics and to produce our products, and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business. for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a. 28 table of contents recent developments on july 27, 2017, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan (the 2017 restructuring plan ) to more closely align our financial resources with the critical priorities of our business. after completion of the 2017 restructuring plan, we recognized approximately $100.4 million of pre-tax charges in connection with this plan. in addition to these charges, we also recognized restructuring related goodwill impairment charges of approximately $28.7 million for our connected fitness business. on february 9, 2018, our board of directors approved an additional restructuring plan (the "2018 restructuring plan") identifying further opportunities to optimize operations. in conjunction with the 2018 restructuring plan, approximately $110 to $130 million of pre-tax restructuring and related charges are expected to be incurred during our 2018 fiscal year, including: up to $105.0 million in cash charges, consisting of up to: $55.0 million in facility and lease terminations and $50.0 million in contract termination and other restructuring charges; and up to $25.0 million in non-cash charges comprised of approximately $10.0 million of inventory related charges and approximately $15.0 million of intangibles and other asset related impairments. the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017. the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affect us and, as required, we have included reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate in our 2017 financial results. these changes include a one-time mandatory transition tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings and a re-measuring of deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase to our provision for income taxes of $38.8 million. since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017, we consider the accounting for the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be provisional as the charge may be adjusted due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the tax legislation. we expect to finalize our estimates within the one-year measurement period allowed by the sec. general net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and connected fitness revenues. net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us by our licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on their products. our connected fitness revenues consist of digital advertising, digital fitness platform licenses and subscriptions from our connected fitness business. cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. the fabrics in many of our products are made primarily of petroleum-based synthetic materials. therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. in general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear. a limited portion of cost of goods sold is associated with license and connected fitness revenues, primarily website hosting costs. we include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. as a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. these costs were $101.5 million , $89.9 million and $63.7 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services. we consolidate our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other, which includes our selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services categories. personnel costs are included in these categories based on the employees' function. personnel costs include salaries, benefits, incentives and stock-based compensation related to our employees. our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth. marketing costs consist primarily of commercials, print ads, league, team, player and event sponsorships and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture program. 29 table of contents other expense, net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries. 30 table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a

driven primarily by: apparel unit sales growth in multiple categories led by men's and women's training and golf; and accessories unit sales growth in multiple categories led by men's training; and footwear unit sales growth in multiple categories led by running. license revenues increase d $16.7 million , or 16.8% , to $116.6 million in 2017 from $99.8 million in 2016 . this increase in license revenues was driven primarily by increased distribution of our licensed products in north america . connected fitness revenue increase d $8.8 million , or 10.9% , to $89.2 million in 2017 from $80.4 million in 2016 primarily driven by increased subscribers on our fitness applications and higher licensing revenue. gross profit decreased $1.9 million to $2,238.7 million in 2017 from $2,240.6 million in 2016 . gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decreased 140 basis points to 45.0% in 2017 compared to 46.4% in 2016 . the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following: an approximate 190 basis point decrease due to inventory management efforts including higher promotions and increased air freight; and an approximate 20 basis point decrease due to our international business representing a higher percentage of sales; the above decreases were partially offset by: an approximate 50 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable product input costs; and an approximate 30 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable channel mix with increased sales in our direct-to-consumer channel. with the exception of favorable product input costs and channel mix, we do not expect these trends to have a material impact on 2018. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $263.7 million to $2,086.8 million in 2017 from $1,823.1 million in 2016 . as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 41.9% in 2017 from 37.8% in 2016 . selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following: marketing costs increased $87.6 million to $565.1 million in 2017 from $ 477.5 million in 2016 . this increase was primarily due to increased marketing spend in connection with the growth of our international business and in connection with our collegiate and professional athlete sponsorships. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs increased to 11.4% in 2017 from 9.9% in 2016 . other costs increased $176.1 million to $1,521.7 million in 2017 from $1,345.6 million in 2016 . this increase was primarily driven by higher costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel and international business. this increase was partially offset by savings from our 2017 restructuring plan. as a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 30.6% in 2017 from 27.9% in 2016 . 32 table of contents income from operations decreased $389.6 million , or 93.3% , to $27.8 million in 2017 from $ 417.5 million in 2016 . income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 0.6% in 2017 from 8.6% in 2016 . income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by $124.0 million of restructuring and impairment charges in connection with the 2017 restructuring plan. interest expense, net increased $8.1 million to $ 34.5 million in 2017 from $ 26.4 million in 2016 . this increase was primarily due to interest on the net increase of $99.7 million in total debt outstanding. other expense, net increased $0.9 million to $3.6 million in 2017 from $2.8 million in 2016 . this increase was due to lower net gains on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and our derivative financial instruments as compared to the prior period. provision for income taxes decreased $93.3 million to $38.0 million in 2017 from $131.3 million in 2016 . our effective tax rate was (368.2)% in 2017 compared to 33.8% in 2016 . our effective tax rate for 2017 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2016 primarily due to the significant decrease in income before taxes, the impact of tax benefits recorded on losses in the united states, and reductions in our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse in the statute of limitations during the current period. these benefits were offset by the impact of the tax act, non-deductible goodwill impairment charges, and the recording of certain valuation allowances. our provision for income taxes in 2017 included $38.8 million of income tax expense as a result of the tax act, including a $13.9 million charge for our provisional estimate of the transition tax and $24.9 million for the provisional re-measurement of our deferred tax assets for the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. year ended december 31, 2016 compared to year ended december 31, 2015 net revenues increased $862.0 million, or 21.8%, to $4,825.3 million in 2016 from $3,963.3 million in 2015. net revenues by product category are summarized below: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2016 2015 $ change % change apparel $

$15.6 million, or 18.6%, to $99.8 million in 2016 from $84.2 million in 2015. this increase in license revenues was driven primarily by increased distribution of our licensed products in north america and japan. connected fitness revenue increased $27.0 million, or 50.6%, to $80.4 million in 2016 from $53.4 million in 2015 primarily driven by increased advertising and subscribers on our fitness applications. gross profit increased $335.1 million to $2,240.6 million in 2016 from $1,905.5 million in 2015. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decreased 170 basis points to 46.4% in 2016 compared to 48.1% in 2015. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following: approximate 120 basis point decrease due to increased liquidation and discounting; approximate 70 basis point decrease driven by negative sales mix primarily driven by the continued strength of our accelerated footwear growth; and approximate 40 basis point decrease due to strengthening of the u.s. dollar negatively impacting our gross margins within our business outside the united states. the above decreases were partially offset by: 33 table of contents approximate 30 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable product input costs in our north america and international businesses; and approximate 40 basis point increase driven primarily by lower air freight costs. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $326.1 million to $1,823.1 million in 2016 from $1,497.0 million in 2015. as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent at 37.8% in 2016 and in 2015. selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following: marketing costs increased $59.7 million to $477.5 million in 2016 from $417.8 million in 2015. this increase was primarily due to key north american retail marketing campaigns, our investments in sponsorships and increased marketing in connection with the growth of our international business. this increase was offset by lower incentive compensation expense for marketing employees. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 9.9% in 2016 from 10.5% in 2015. other costs increased $266.4 million to $1,345.6 million in 2016 from $1,079.2 million in 2015. this increase was primarily due to higher personnel and other costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel, including increased investment for our factory house and brand house stores. additionally, we incurred $17.0 million in expenses related to the liquidation of the sports authority, comprised of $15.2 million in bad debt expense and $1.8 million of in-store fixture impairment. this increase was offset by lower incentive compensation expense. as a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 27.9% in 2016 from 27.2% in 2015. income from operations increased $8.9 million, or 2.2%, to $417.5 million in 2016 from $408.5 million in 2015. income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 8.6% in 2016 from 10.3% in 2015. interest expense, net increased $11.8 million to $26.4 million in 2016 from $14.6 million in 2015. this increase was primarily due to interest on the net increase of $284.2 million in total debt outstanding. other expense, net decreased $4.4 million to $2.8 million in 2016 from $7.2 million in 2015. this decrease was due to higher net gains on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and our derivative financial instruments as compared to the prior period. provision for income taxes decreased $22.8 million to $131.3 million in 2016 from $154.1 million in 2015. our effective tax rate was 33.8% in 2016 compared to 39.9% in 2015. our effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2015 primarily due to increased international profitability and a tax benefit related to our prior period acquisitions. 34 table of contents segment results of operations the net revenues and operating income (loss) associated with our segments are summarized in the following

connected fitness segment decreased $24.5 million to $36.8 million in 2016 from $61.3 million in 2015 primarily driven by sales growth discussed above. 37 table of contents seasonality historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher priced cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. the following table sets forth certain financial information for the periods indicated. the data is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. all recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below: quarter ended (unaudited) (in thousands) 3/31/2016 6/30/2016 9/30/2016 12/31/2016

capital expenditures. we fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowings available under our credit and long term debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities. our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the back half of the year. our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our new brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. these systems and processes, including our new global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments and our ability to access the capital markets are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. although we believe we 38 table of contents have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, an economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity (refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a). in addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all. at december 31, 2017 , $158.7 million , or approximately 50.8% , of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states. in addition, our united states operations do not require the repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs. should we require additional capital in the united states, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states. the tax act provided for a one-time transition tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings to transition u.s. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system. we recorded a provisional tax liability of $13.9 million relating to the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would not be subject to additional u.s. federal income tax, however, we would be required to accrue and pay any applicable withholding tax and u.s. state income tax liabilities and record foreign exchange rate impacts. cash flows the following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $ 234,063 $ 364,368 $ 14,541 investing activities (282,987 ) (381,139 ) (847,475 ) financing activities 106,759 146,114 381,433 effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 4,178 (8,725 ) (11,822 ) net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 62,013 $ 120,618 $ (463,323 ) operating activities operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. in addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses. cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $130.3 million to $234.1 million in 2017 from $364.4 million in 2016 . the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income of $305.2 million . this decrease was partially offset by a smaller decrease in accounts receivable of $170.1 million. cash flows provided by operating activities increased $349.8 million to $364.4 million in 2016 from $14.6 million in 2015 . the increase in cash from operating activities was due to increased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $325.4 million , an increase in net income of $24.4 million year over year and an increase in adjustments to net income for non-cash items of $1.1 million year over year. the increase in cash outflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following: an increase in accounts payable of $225.0 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 , primarily due to the timing of inventory payments as well as significant increases in inventory in-transit in the current period, and a decrease in inventory investments of $130.5 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 , primarily due to early deliveries of product to meet key seasonal floor set dates in the prior period, as well as strategic investments in auto-replenishment products in 2015 ; partially offset by a larger increase in accounts receivable of $58.0 million in 2016 as compared to 2015 , primarily due to the timing of shipments and a higher proportion of sales to our international customers with longer payment terms compared to the prior year. investing activities 39 table of contents cash used in investing activities decreased $98.2 million to $283.0 million in 2017 from $ 381.1 million in 2016 , primarily due lower capital expenditures in 2017. cash used in investing activities decreased $466.4 million to $381.1 million in 2016 from $847.5 million in 2015, primarily due to the impact of our connected fitness acquisitions of myfitnesspal and endomondo which occurred during the first quarter of 2015. total capital expenditures were $274.9 million, $405.5 million, and $325.5 in 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be approximately $225.0 million. financing activities cash provided by financing activities decreased $39.4 million to $ 106.8 million in 2017 from $ 146.1 million in 2016 . this decrease was primarily due to lower borrowing on our revolving credit facility. cash provided by financing activities decreased $235.3 million to $ 146.1 million in 2016 from $ 381.4 million in 2015 . this decrease was primarily due to higher repayments on our revolving credit facility, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in 2016 . credit facility we are party to a credit agreement that provides revolving commitments for up to $1.25 billion of borrowings, as well as term loan commitments, in each case maturing in january 2021. as of december 31, 2017 the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility was $125.0 million and $161.3 million of term loan borrowings remained outstanding. at our request and the lender's consent, revolving and or term loan borrowings may be increased by up to $300.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, as amended. incremental borrowings are uncommitted and the availability thereof, will depend on market conditions at the time we seek to incur such borrowings. the borrowings under the revolving credit facility have maturities of less than one year. up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. there were $4.5 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2017 . the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge our assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. we are also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00 and are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 ("consolidated leverage ratio"). as of december 31, 2017 , we were in compliance with these ratios. in february 2018, we amended the credit agreement to amend the definition of consolidated ebitda, and to provide that our trailing four-quarter consolidated leverage ratio may not exceed 3.75 to 1.00 for the four quarters ended june 30, 2018, and 4.00 to 1.00 for the four quarters ended september 30, 3018. beginning with the four quarters ended december 31, 2018 and thereafter, the consolidated leverage ratio requirement will return to 3.25 to 1.00. in addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made ( adjusted libor ), plus in each case an applicable margin. the applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the pricing grid ) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between 1.00% to 1.25% for adjusted libor loans and 0.00% to 0.25% for alternate base rate loans. the weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings was 2.2% and 1.6% during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. we pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit. as of december 31, 2017 , the commitment fee was 17.5 basis points. since inception, we have incurred and deferred $3.9 million in financing costs in connection with the credit agreement. 40 table of contents 3.250% senior notes in june 2016, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due june 15, 2026 (the notes ). the proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. interest is payable semi-annually on june 15 and december 15 beginning december 15, 2016. prior to march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or a make-whole amount applicable to such notes as described in the indenture governing the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. on or after march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. the indenture governing the notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture. we incurred and deferred $5.3 million in financing costs in connection with the notes. other long term debt in december 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising our corporate headquarters. the loan has a seven year term and maturity date of december 2019. the loan bears interest at one month libor plus a margin of 1.50% , and allows for prepayment without penalty. the loan includes covenants and events of default substantially consistent with our credit agreement discussed above. the loan also requires prior approval of the lender for certain matters related to the property, including transfers of any interest in the property. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the outstanding balance on the loan was $40.0 million and $42.0 million , respectively. the weighted average interest rate on the loan was 2.5% and 2.0% for the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. interest expense, net was $34.5 million , $26.4 million , and $14.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities. amortization of deferred financing costs was $1.3 million , $1.2 million , and $0.8 million for the years ended december 31, 2017 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively. we monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities. contractual commitments and contingencies we lease warehouse space, office facilities, space for our brand and factory house stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. the leases expire at various dates through 2033 , excluding extensions at our option, and include provisions for rental adjustments. in addition, this table includes executed lease agreements for brand and factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of december 31, 2017 . the operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time. our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2017 as well as significant agreements entered into during the period after december 31, 2017 through the date of this report are summarized in the

some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations. it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. the amount of product provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. in addition, it is not possible to determine the performance incentive amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based and other variables. the amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these sponsorship agreements. additionally, these amounts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments to endorsers and licensors based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. the table above excludes a liability of $54.4 million for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions. off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad faith. based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. to prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. we believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements. the sec suggests companies provide additional disclosure on those accounting policies considered most critical. the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. it is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended december 31, 2017 . 42 table of contents revenue recognition net revenues consist of both net sales and license and other revenues. net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. transfer of title and risk of loss are based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. in some instances, transfer of title and risk of loss take place at the point of sale, for example at our brand and factory house stores. we may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. license revenues are primarily recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees. sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis on the consolidated statements of income and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold. we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. the actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. if we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination. provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers. reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable as settlements are made through offsets to outstanding customer invoices. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , there were $246.6 million and $146.2 million , respectively, in reserves for customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. in determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates. if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. in the event we determine a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination was made. as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , the allowance for doubtful accounts was $19.7 million and $11.3 million , respectively. inventory valuation and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods. costs of finished goods inventories include all costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including inbound freight, duties and other costs. we value our inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or market. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those that we projected , further adjustments may be required that would increase the cost of goods sold in the period in which such a determination was made. 43 table of contents goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are allocated to the reporting units that are expected to receive the related benefits. goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. in conducting an annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if factors indicate that is the case, we perform the goodwill impairment test. we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. we calculate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, which indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business, and working capital effects. if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, goodwill is impaired to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. we perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows. when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. if future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made. a significant portion of our deferred tax assets relate to u.s. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future u.s. pre-tax earnings. due to our challenged u.s. results we incurred significant net operating losses ( nols ) in these jurisdictions in 2017. based on these factors, we have evaluated our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets in future years. in evaluating the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at december 31, 2017, we have considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following: positive availability of taxable income in the u.s. federal and certain state nol carryback periods; u.s. federal nols have an indefinite carryforward period, beginning in 2018 pursuant to the tax act; definite lived tax attributes with relatively long carryforward periods; a majority from 10 to 20 years; no history of u.s. federal and state tax attributes expiring unused; three year cumulative u.s. federal and state pre-tax income; relative low values of pre-tax income required to realized deferred tax assets relative to historic income levels; restructuring plans being undertaken to improve profitability; availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. negative inherent challenges in forecasting future pre-tax earnings which rely on improved profitability from our restructuring efforts; the continuing challenge of changes in the u.s. consumer retail business environment; 44 table of contents while relatively long, existence of definite lived tax attributes of certain u.s. federal tax credits and state nols; as of december 31, 2017, we believe that the weight of the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence regarding the realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets. we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements. as of december 31, 2017 , we had $87.7 million of unrecognized compensation expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.2 years. this unrecognized compensation expense does not include any expense related to performance-based restricted stock units and stock options for which the performance targets have not been achieved as of december 31, 2017 . the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. in addition, compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance targets are deemed probable, which requires management judgment. the achievement of certain revenue and operating income targets related to the performance-based restricted stock units and stock options granted in 2017 were not deemed probable as of december 31, 2017 . additional stock-based compensation expense of up to $5.7 million would have been recorded from grant date through 2017 for these performance-based restricted stock units and stock options had the full achievement of all operating targets been deemed probable; however, currently we do not believe that these targets will be met. as a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. refer to note 2 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock-based compensation. recently issued accounting standards refer to note 2 to the notes to our financial statements included in this form 10-k for our assessment of recently issued accounting standards. item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. as our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, as we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar during the consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. from time to time, we may elect to use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations primarily on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our international subsidiaries. as we expand our international business, we anticipate expanding our current hedging program to include additional currency pairs and instruments. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. as of december 31, 2017 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts was $601.0 million , which was comprised of canadian dollar/u.s. dollar, euro/u.s. dollar, mexican peso/u.s. dollar, yen/u.s. 45 table of contents dollar, mexican peso/euro and south korean won/u.s. dollar. currency pairs with contract maturities of one to eleven months. the majority of our foreign currency contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. we enter into foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. for foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, excluding any ineffective portion, is recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged transaction. the effective portion is generally released to net income after the maturity of the related derivative and is classified in the same manner as the underlying exposure. during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 , we reclassified $0.4 million and $0.3 million , respectively, from other comprehensive income to cost of goods sold related to foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. the fair value of our foreign currency contracts was a liability of $6.8 million as of december 31, 2017 and was included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair value of our foreign currency contracts was an asset of $15.2 million as of december 31, 2016 and was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2017 2016 2015 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ 29,246 $ (12,627 ) $ (33,359 ) realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) 611 (6,906 ) 7,643 unrealized derivative gains (losses) (1,217 ) 729 388 realized derivative gains (losses) (26,537 ) 15,192 16,404 we enter into foreign currency contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk i n order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. we utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. the contracts pay fixed and receive variable rates of interest. the interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation . as of december 31, 2017 , the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts was $135.6 million . during the years ended december 31, 2017 and 2016 , we recorded a $0.9 million and $2.0 million increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contracts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of $1.1 million as of december 31, 2017 and was included in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of $0.4 million as of december 31, 2016 and was included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. credit risk w e are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2017 . see "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies and estimates - allowance for doubtful accounts." inflation 46 table of contents inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in recent periods, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 47 table of contentsrisk factors 8 risk factors forward-looking statements some of the statements contained

you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, unemployment, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in north america, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2018, sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 60% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. we generate a significant portion of our wholesale revenues from sales to our largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with our key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation, particularly in the sports specialty sector. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to continue to grow our net revenues, or our net revenues may decline. we may not successfully execute our long-term strategies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. our ability to execute on our long-term strategies depends, in part, on successfully executing on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. if we are unable to grow net revenues in our international business at the rate we expect, or if our north america business, which represented 72% of our total net revenues in 2018, were to experience significant market disruption, our ability to continue to invest in these growth initiatives would be negatively impacted. in addition, our long-term strategy depends on our 9 table of contents ability to successfully drive expansion of our gross margins, manage our cost structure and drive return on our investments. if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected results of operations. we may not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability. in 2017 and 2018 we executed restructuring plans designed to more closely align our financial resources against the critical priorities of our business. these plans included initiatives to improve operational efficiencies, and included reductions in our global workforce. we may not achieve our targeted operational improvements and efficiencies, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements and/or cost reductions. these risks include, among others, higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans, damage to our reputation and brand image and workforce attrition beyond planned reductions. if we fail to achieve targeted operating improvements and/or cost reductions, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. we must successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business, or our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and we must continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences, successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products or engage our consumers, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products or design products in the categories and styles that consumers want, demand for our products could decline and our brand image could be negatively impacted. our failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. in addition, if we experience problems with the quality of our products, our brand reputation may be negatively impacted and we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems, which could negatively impact our results of operations. 10 table of contents in addition, consumer preferences regarding the shopping experience continue to rapidly evolve. if we or our wholesale customers do not provide consumers with an attractive in-store experience, or if we do not continue to provide an engaging and user-friendly digital commerce platform that attracts consumers, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during the last two quarters of the year, which historically has been our peak season. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results. sales of performance products may not continue to grow or may decline, which could negatively impact our sales and our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow or rather decline, our sales could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected financial results. in addition, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and 11 table of contents future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in products similar to ours and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies has been to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers have better sell through or earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could negatively impact our brand image. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. 12 table of contents we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide raw materials for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2018, 10 manufacturers produced approximately 55% of our apparel and accessories products, and five produced approximately 87% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. a significant element of our future growth strategy depends on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2018, 72% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices in certain regions outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in those markets. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources and may be more costly than we expect. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of more limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to successfully grow our business outside north america would negatively impact our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets. 13 table of contents our financial results and ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted by economic, regulatory and political risks beyond our control. substantially all of our manufacturers are located outside of the united states and an increasing amount of our net revenue is generated by sales in our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards , as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; uncertainties and the effects of the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the european union and the associated financial, legal, tax and trade implications ; actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities impacting trade and foreign investment, particularly during periods of heightened tension between u.s. and foreign governments, including the imposition of new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties, trade restrictions or restrictions on the transfer of funds ; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our stores, customers, manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could hamper our ability to sell products in international markets, negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials and increase our cost of doing business generally, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, or if we are required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill, it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, we may not realize the financial benefits or other synergies we anticipated. in addition, in connection with our acquisitions, we may record goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. we have recognized goodwill impairment charges in the past. if an acquired business does not produce results consistent with financial models used in our analysis of an acquisition, or if reporting units carrying goodwill do not meet our current expectations of future growth rates or market factors outside of our control change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. our credit agreement contains financial covenants, and both our credit agreement and debt securities contain other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. our debt securities limit our ability to, subject to certain significant exceptions, incur secured debt and engage in sale leaseback transactions. our credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement, and in the past we have amended our credit agreement to increase these ratios in certain quarterly periods specifically, in 2018 we amended the credit agreement to increase these ratios for the second and third quarters of 2018. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions 14 table of contents that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement or our debt securities could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations (including our debt securities) will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. our debt securities include a cross acceleration provision which provides that the acceleration of certain other debt obligations (including our credit agreement) will be considered an event of default under our debt securities and, subject to certain time and notice periods, give bondholders the right to accelerate our debt securities. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. our credit ratings have been downgraded previously, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to the mix of our products sold during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. our quarterly results may also vary based on the timing of customer orders. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. we generated approximately 26% of our consolidated net revenues outside the united states. as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency 15 table of contents exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our business could be adversely impacted if negative publicity regarding our brand, our company or our business partners diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, while we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct, we do not control their practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. these and other types of negative publicity, especially through social media which potentially accelerates and increases the scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact our brand image and result in diminished loyalty to our brand, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. this could have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and disrupt our ability to conduct our business, as well as damage our brand image with consumers. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant unanticipated compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. 16 table of contents if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by severe weather conditions, floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our results of operations, as well as our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could have a materially adverse impact on our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications, and these systems face similar risk of interruption or attack. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. we also rely on third parties for the operation of certain of our e-commerce websites, and do not control these service providers. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, vendor, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may 17 table of contents also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could negatively impact our results of operations. for example, in early 2018 an unauthorized third party acquired data associated with our connected fitness users' accounts for our myfitnesspal application and website. approximately 150 million user accounts were affected by this issue, and the affected information included usernames, email addresses and hashed passwords. a consumer class action lawsuit has been filed against us in connection with this incident, and we may face a number of legal claims or investigations by government regulators and agencies. we may also be required to incur additional expense to further enhance our data security infrastructure. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data. compliance with existing, proposed and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, called the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar or stricter measures. any of these factors could negatively impact our profitability, result in negative publicity and damage our brand image or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. we are in the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes, which began in 2015 and will continue in phases over the next few years. the first phase of this implementation became operational during 2017 in our north america, emea and connected fitness operations. the next phase of this implementation is planned to become operational in 2019 in our asia-pacific region, and we are in the process of developing an implementation strategy and roll-out plan for our latin american region. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-u.s. earnings for which we have not previously provided applicable withholding tax, u.s. state income taxes, or foreign exchange rate impacts. for example, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017, which had a significant impact to our provision for income taxes as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2018. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service, u.s. states taxing authorities, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. additionally, many of the countries in which we do business have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting final proposals from the organization for economic co-operation and development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. 18 table of contents we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments to support our digital strategy. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer and other top executives. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to profitably grow our business and manage our operations, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business and achieve our long term objectives. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, including our digital business. from 19 table of contents time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are subject to periodic claims, litigation and investigations that could result in unexpected expenses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. given the size and extent of our global operations, we are involved in a variety of litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and may be subject to investigations, audits, inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry. for example, we are subject to an ongoing securities class action proceeding regarding our prior disclosures and derivative complaints regarding related matters, as well as past related party transactions, among other proceedings. we are also party to a consumer class action lawsuit filed in connection with our first quarter 2018 data security incident. refer to note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these specific matters. legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. any of our legal proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or our stock price. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers or our shareholders, as well as our brand image. the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time. the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our non-voting class c common stock has traded at a discount to our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. 20 table of contents kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding and in other limited circumstances. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45 item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 47 item 9 changes in and

signatures 89 table of contents part i item 1. business general our principal business activities are the development, marketing and distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. the brand's performance apparel and footwear are engineered in many designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and are worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. we generate net revenues from the sale of our products globally to national, regional, independent and specialty wholesalers and distributors. we also generate net revenue from the sale of our products through our direct to consumer sales channel, which includes our brand and factory house stores and websites. in addition, we generate net revenues through product licensing and digital fitness subscriptions and digital advertising on our connected fitness applications. a large majority of our products are sold in north america; however we believe that our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. our digital strategy is focused on supporting these long term objectives, emphasizing the connection and engagement with our consumers through multiple digital touch points, including through our connected fitness business. we were incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1996. as used in this report, the terms we, our, us, under armour and the company refer to under armour, inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. we have registered trademarks around the globe, including under armour , heatgear , coldgear and the under armour ua logo, and we have applied to register many other trademarks. this annual report on form 10-k also contains additional trademarks and tradenames of our company and our subsidiaries. all trademarks and tradenames appearing in this annual report on form 10-k are the property of their respective holders. products our product offerings consist of apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. we market our products at multiple price levels and provide consumers with products that we believe are a superior alternative to traditional athletic products. in 2018, sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 67%, 20% and 8% of net revenues, respectively. licensing arrangements and revenue from our connected fitness business represented the remaining 5% of net revenues. refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for net revenues by product. apparel our apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility, regulate body temperature and improve performance regardless of weather conditions. our apparel is engineered to replace traditional non-performance fabrics in the world of athletics and fitness with performance alternatives designed and merchandised with a variety of innovative techniques and gearlines. our primary gearlines are marketed to tell a very simple story about our highly technical products and extend across the sporting goods, outdoor and active lifestyle markets. we market our apparel for consumers to choose heatgear when it is hot and coldgear when it is cold. within each gearline our apparel comes in three primary fit types: compression (tight fit), fitted (athletic fit) and loose (relaxed). heatgear is designed to be worn in warm to hot temperatures under equipment or as a single layer. while a sweat-soaked traditional non-performance t-shirt can weigh two to three pounds, heatgear is engineered with a microfiber blend designed to wick moisture from the body which helps the body stay cool, dry and light. we offer heatgear in a variety of tops and bottoms in a broad array of colors and styles for wear in the gym or outside in warm weather. coldgear is designed to wick moisture from the body while circulating body heat from hot spots to help maintain core body temperature. our coldgear apparel provides both dryness and warmth in a single light 1 table of contents layer that can be worn beneath a jersey, uniform, protective gear or ski-vest, and our coldgear outerwear products protect the athlete, as well as the coach and the fan from the outside in. our coldgear products generally sell at higher prices than our other gearlines. footwear our footwear offerings include running, basketball, cleated, slides and performance training, sportstyle, and outdoor footwear. our footwear is light, breathable and built with performance attributes for athletes. our footwear is designed with innovative technologies including ua hovr , anafoam , ua clutch fit and charged cushioning , which provide stabilization, directional cushioning and moisture management engineered to maximize the athlete's comfort and control. accessories accessories primarily includes the sale of athletic performance gloves, bags and headwear. our accessories include heatgear and coldgear technologies and are designed with advanced fabrications to provide the same level of performance as our other products. connected fitness we offer digital fitness subscriptions, along with digital advertising through our mapmyfitness, myfitnesspal and endomondo platforms. our mapmyfitness platform includes applications, such as mapmyrun and mapmyride. license we have agreements with licensees to develop certain under armour apparel, accessories and equipment. in order to maintain consistent quality and performance, our product, marketing, sales and quality assurance teams are involved in substantially all steps of the design and go to market process in order to maintain brand and compliance standards and consistency. during 2018, our licensees offered collegiate, national football league ("nfl") and national basketball association ("nba") apparel and accessories, baby and youth apparel, team uniforms, socks, water bottles, eyewear and other specific hard goods equipment that feature performance advantages and functionality similar to our other product offerings. marketing and promotion we currently focus on marketing our products to consumers primarily for use in athletics, fitness, and training activities and as part of an active lifestyle. we seek to drive consumer demand by building brand awareness that our products deliver advantages to help athletes perform better. sports marketing our marketing and promotion strategy begins with providing and selling our products to high-performing athletes and teams at the high school, collegiate and professional levels. we execute this strategy through outfitting agreements, professional, club, and collegiate sponsorship, individual athlete and influencer agreements and by providing and selling our products directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. we also seek to sponsor and host consumer events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level by hosting combines, camps and clinics for young athletes in many sports. as a result, our products are seen on the field and on the court, and by various consumer audiences through the internet, television, magazines and live at sporting events. this exposure to consumers helps us establish on-field authenticity as consumers can see our products being worn by high-performing athletes. we are the official outfitter of athletic teams in several high-profile collegiate conferences. we are an official supplier of footwear and gloves to the nfl and a partner with the nba which allows us to market our nba athletes in game uniforms in connection with our products, including basketball footwear. we are the official headwear and performance apparel provider for the nfl scouting combine and the official partner and title sponsor of the nba draft combine. in each case we have the right to sell licensed combine training apparel and headwear. in 2018, we exited our agreement to be the official on-field uniform supplier, official authentic performance apparel partner, and official connected fitness partner of mlb, while retaining our rights as an official performance footwear supplier and sponsor of mlb. in 2018, we worked with a manufacturing and distribution partner to sell mlb fan wear at retail. we sponsor and sell our products to international sports teams, which helps to drive brand awareness in various countries and regions around the world. 2 table of contents media we feature our products in a variety of national digital, broadcast, and print media outlets. we also utilize social and mobile media to engage consumers and promote connectivity with our brand and our products. for example, in 2018, we had a digitally led marketing approach for the launch of our ua hovr run franchise, which included a variety of content on various social media platforms. retail presentation the primary goal of our retail marketing strategy is to increase brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. the design and funding of under armour point of sale displays and concept shops within our major retail accounts has been a key initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our brand. under armour point of sale displays and concept shops enhance our brand's presentation within our major retail accounts with a shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images. sales and distribution the majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels, which include national and regional sporting goods chains, independent and specialty retailers, department store chains, institutional athletic departments and leagues and teams. in various countries where we do not have direct sales operations, we sell our products to independent distributors or we engage licensees to sell our products. we also sell our products directly to consumers through our own network of brand and factory house stores and through websites globally. factory house stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing us to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products while maintaining the pricing integrity of our brand in our other distribution channels. through our brand house stores, consumers experience the premium full expression of our brand while having broader access to our performance products. in 2018, sales through our wholesale, direct to consumer, licensing and connected fitness channels represented 60%, 35%, 3% and 2% of net revenues, respectively. we believe the trend toward performance products is global and plan to continue to introduce our products and simple merchandising story to athletes throughout the world. we are introducing our performance products and services outside of north america in a manner consistent with our past brand-building strategy, including selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes in these markets, thereby providing us with product exposure to broad audiences of potential consumers. our primary business operates in four geographic segments: (1) north america, comprising the united states and canada, (2) europe, the middle east and africa "emea", (3) asia-pacific, and (4) latin america. each of these geographic segments operate predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and distribution of performance apparel, footwear and accessories. we also operate our connected fitness business as a separate segment. the majority of corporate service costs within north america have not been allocated to our other segments. as we continue to grow our business outside of north america, a larger portion of our corporate overhead costs have begun to support global functions. during 2019, we plan to exclude certain corporate costs from our segment profitability measures. we believe this presentation will provide the users of our financial statements with increased transparency and comparability of our operating segments. our north america segment accounted for approximately 72% of our net revenues for 2018. approximately 26% of our net revenues were generated from our international segments in 2018. approximately 2% of our net revenues were generated from our connected fitness segment in 2018. no customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in 2018. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term in part through continued expansion in new and established international markets. refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for net revenues by segment. north america we sell our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in north america through our wholesale and direct to consumer channels. net revenues generated from the sales of our products in the united states were $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively. our direct to consumer sales are generated through our brand and factory house stores and internet websites. as of december 31, 2018, we had 163 factory house stores in north america primarily located in outlet centers throughout the united states. as of december 31, 2018, we had 16 brand house stores in north america. consumers can purchase our products directly from our e-commerce website, www.underarmour.com. 3 table of contents in addition, we earn licensing revenue in north america based on our licensees' sale of collegiate and league apparel and accessories, as well as sales of other licensed products. we distribute the majority of our products sold to our north american wholesale customers and our own retail stores and e-commerce businesses from distribution facilities we lease and operate in california, maryland and tennessee. in addition, we distribute our products in north america through third-party logistics providers with primary locations in canada, new jersey and florida. in some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from the factories that manufacture our products directly to customer-designated facilities. emea we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories primarily through wholesale customers, website operations, independent distributors and a limited number of stores we operate in certain european countries. we also sell our branded products to various sports clubs and teams in europe. we generally distribute our products to our retail customers and e-commerce consumers in europe through a third-party logistics provider in the netherlands. we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories through independent distributors in the middle east and africa. asia-pacific we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories products in china, south korea and australia through stores operated by our distribution and wholesale partners, along with website operations and stores we operate. we also sell our products to distributors in new zealand, taiwan, hong kong and other countries in southeast asia where we do not have direct sales operations. we distribute our products in asia-pacific primarily through a third-party logistics provider based in hong kong. we have a license agreement with dome corporation, which produces, markets and sells our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in japan. our branded products are sold in japan to large sporting goods retailers, independent specialty stores and professional sports teams, and through licensee-owned retail stores. we hold an equity method investment in dome. latin america we sell our products in mexico, chile, colombia and argentina through wholesale customers, website operations and brand and factory house stores. in these countries we operate through third-party distribution facilities. in other latin american countries we distribute our products through independent distributors which are sourced primarily through our international distribution hub in panama. on october 1, 2018, we sold our brazilian subsidiary. in connection with this sale, we entered into a license and distribution agreement with a third party that will continue to sell our products in brazil. connected fitness in 2013, we began offering digital fitness subscriptions, along with digital advertising through our mapmyfitness platform. in 2015, we acquired the endomondo and myfitnesspal platforms to create our connected fitness segment. we plan to engage this community by developing innovative services and other digital solutions to impact how athletes and fitness-minded individuals train, perform and live. seasonality historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher priced cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. product design and development our products are developed in collaboration with our product development teams and manufactured with technical fabrications produced by third parties. this approach enables us to select and create superior, technically advanced materials, curated to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on style, performance and fit. with a mission to make athletes better, we seek to deliver superior performance in all products. our developers proactively identify opportunities to create and improve performance products that meet the evolving needs of our consumer. we design products with consumer-valued technologies, utilizing color, texture and fabrication to enhance our consumers perception and understanding of product use and benefits. 4 table of contents our product development team works closely with our sports marketing and sales teams as well as professional and collegiate athletes to identify product trends and determine market needs. for example, these teams worked closely to identify the opportunity and market for our coldgear infrared product, which is a ceramic print technology on the inside of our garments that provides athletes with lightweight warmth, and ua hovr , a proprietary underfoot cushioning wrapped in a mesh web, equipped with a mapmyrun powered sensor designed to deliver energy return and real-time coaching. in 2017 we also opened our newest center for footwear performance innovation located in portland, oregon, bringing together footwear design and development teams into a centralized location. sourcing, manufacturing and quality assurance many of the specialty fabrics and other raw materials used in our apparel products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short term, from a limited number of sources. the fabric and other raw materials used to manufacture our apparel products are sourced by our contracted manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us . in 2018, approximately 49% of the fabric used in our apparel products came from 5 suppliers. these fabric suppliers have primary locations in taiwan, malaysia, mexico, vietnam and turkey. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. we also use cotton in some of our apparel products, as a blended fabric and also in our charged cotton line. cotton is a commodity that is subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. additionally, our footwear uses raw materials that are sourced from a diverse base of third party suppliers. this includes chemicals and petroleum-based components such as rubber that are also subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers. in 2018, our apparel and accessories products were manufactured by 44 primary contract manufacturers, operating in 16 countries, with approximately 58% of our apparel and accessories products manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. of our 44 primary contract manufacturers, 10 produced approximately 55% of our apparel and accessories products. in 2018, our footwear products were manufactured by five primary contract manufacturers, operating primarily in china, vietnam and indonesia. these five primary contract manufacturers produced approximately 87% of our footwear products. all manufacturers across all product divisions are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our internal teams prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. we also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of goods sold. we enter into a variety of agreements with our contract manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing, working conditions and other social concerns. we do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products for the long term. we have subsidiaries strategically located near our key partners to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for our products. we also manufacture a limited number of products, primarily for high-profile athletes and teams, on-premises in our quick turn, special make-up shop located at one of our facilities in maryland. inventory management inventory management is important to the financial condition and operating results of our business. we manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. these systems and processes, including our new global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. our practice, and the general practice in the apparel, footwear and accessory industries, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. as it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. 5 table of contents intellectual property we believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products, both domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. our major trademarks include the ua logo and under armour , both of which are registered in the united states, canada, mexico, the european union, japan, china and numerous other countries. we also own trademark registrations for other trademarks including, among others, ua , armour , heatgear , coldgear , protect this house , i will , and many trademarks that incorporate the term armour such as armourbox , armour fleece, and armour bra . we also own applications to protect new connected fitness branding such as myfitnesspal , mapmyfitness and associated mapmy marks and under armour connected fitness . we own domain names for our primary trademarks (most notably underarmour.com and ua.com) and hold copyright registrations for several commercials, as well as for certain artwork. we intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. we will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally. we believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our products from those of others. these trademarks are among our most valuable assets. in addition to our distinctive trademarks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, and we believe our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace. we traditionally have had limited patent protection on some of the technology, materials and processes used in the manufacture of our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments. as we continue to expand and drive innovation in our products, we expect to seek patent protection on products, features and concepts we believe to be strategic and important to our business. we will continue to file patent applications where we deem appropriate to protect our new products, innovations and designs that align with our corporate strategy. we expect the number of applications to increase as our business grows and as we continue to expand our products and innovate. competition the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. many of the fabrics and technology used in manufacturing our products are not unique to us, and we own a limited number of fabric or process patents. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition and significantly greater resources than us, such as nike and adidas. we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in performance apparel and footwear, and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. in addition, we must compete with others for purchasing decisions, as well as limited floor space at retailers. we believe we have been successful in this area because of the relationships we have developed and the strong sales of our products. however, if retailers earn higher margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. we believe we have been able to compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our products and our selective distribution policies. we also believe our focused gearline merchandising story differentiates us from our competition. in the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and expect that we may face greater competition on pricing. this may favor larger competitors with lower production costs per unit that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. the purchasing decisions of consumers for our products often reflect highly subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements and changing styles. employees as of december 31, 2018, we had approximately 15,000 employees, including approximately 9,600 in our brand and factory house stores and approximately 1,800 at our distribution facilities. approximately 7,000 of our employees were full-time. most of our employees are located in the united states. none of our employees in the united states are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there are no material collective bargaining agreements in effect in any of our international locations. we have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. 6 table of contents available information we will make available free of charge on or

table of contents our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, unemployment, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in north america, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2018, sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 60% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. we generate a significant portion of our wholesale revenues from sales to our largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with our key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation, particularly in the sports specialty sector. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to continue to grow our net revenues, or our net revenues may decline. we may not successfully execute our long-term strategies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. our ability to execute on our long-term strategies depends, in part, on successfully executing on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. if we are unable to grow net revenues in our international business at the rate we expect, or if our north america business, which represented 72% of our total net revenues in 2018, were to experience significant market disruption, our ability to continue to invest in these growth initiatives would be negatively impacted. in addition, our long-term strategy depends on our 9 table of contents ability to successfully drive expansion of our gross margins, manage our cost structure and drive return on our investments. if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected results of operations. we may not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability. in 2017 and 2018 we executed restructuring plans designed to more closely align our financial resources against the critical priorities of our business. these plans included initiatives to improve operational efficiencies, and included reductions in our global workforce. we may not achieve our targeted operational improvements and efficiencies, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements and/or cost reductions. these risks include, among others, higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans, damage to our reputation and brand image and workforce attrition beyond planned reductions. if we fail to achieve targeted operating improvements and/or cost reductions, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. we must successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business, or our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and we must continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences, successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products or engage our consumers, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products or design products in the categories and styles that consumers want, demand for our products could decline and our brand image could be negatively impacted. our failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. in addition, if we experience problems with the quality of our products, our brand reputation may be negatively impacted and we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems, which could negatively impact our results of operations. 10 table of contents in addition, consumer preferences regarding the shopping experience continue to rapidly evolve. if we or our wholesale customers do not provide consumers with an attractive in-store experience, or if we do not continue to provide an engaging and user-friendly digital commerce platform that attracts consumers, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during the last two quarters of the year, which historically has been our peak season. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results. sales of performance products may not continue to grow or may decline, which could negatively impact our sales and our ability to grow our business. we believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance apparel, footwear and accessories will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to transition from traditional alternatives to performance products. if consumers are not convinced these products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow or rather decline, our sales could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected financial results. in addition, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and 11 table of contents future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in products similar to ours and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies has been to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers have better sell through or earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could negatively impact our brand image. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. 12 table of contents we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide raw materials for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. many of the materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2018, 10 manufacturers produced approximately 55% of our apparel and accessories products, and five produced approximately 87% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. a significant element of our future growth strategy depends on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2018, 72% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices in certain regions outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in those markets. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources and may be more costly than we expect. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of more limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to successfully grow our business outside north america would negatively impact our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets. 13 table of contents our financial results and ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted by economic, regulatory and political risks beyond our control. substantially all of our manufacturers are located outside of the united states and an increasing amount of our net revenue is generated by sales in our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards , as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; uncertainties and the effects of the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the european union and the associated financial, legal, tax and trade implications ; actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities impacting trade and foreign investment, particularly during periods of heightened tension between u.s. and foreign governments, including the imposition of new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties, trade restrictions or restrictions on the transfer of funds ; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our stores, customers, manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could hamper our ability to sell products in international markets, negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials and increase our cost of doing business generally, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, or if we are required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill, it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, we may not realize the financial benefits or other synergies we anticipated. in addition, in connection with our acquisitions, we may record goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. we have recognized goodwill impairment charges in the past. if an acquired business does not produce results consistent with financial models used in our analysis of an acquisition, or if reporting units carrying goodwill do not meet our current expectations of future growth rates or market factors outside of our control change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. our credit agreement contains financial covenants, and both our credit agreement and debt securities contain other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. our debt securities limit our ability to, subject to certain significant exceptions, incur secured debt and engage in sale leaseback transactions. our credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement, and in the past we have amended our credit agreement to increase these ratios in certain quarterly periods specifically, in 2018 we amended the credit agreement to increase these ratios for the second and third quarters of 2018. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions 14 table of contents that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement or our debt securities could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations (including our debt securities) will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. our debt securities include a cross acceleration provision which provides that the acceleration of certain other debt obligations (including our credit agreement) will be considered an event of default under our debt securities and, subject to certain time and notice periods, give bondholders the right to accelerate our debt securities. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. our credit ratings have been downgraded previously, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to the mix of our products sold during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. our quarterly results may also vary based on the timing of customer orders. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. we generated approximately 26% of our consolidated net revenues outside the united states. as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency 15 table of contents exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our business could be adversely impacted if negative publicity regarding our brand, our company or our business partners diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, while we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct, we do not control their practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. these and other types of negative publicity, especially through social media which potentially accelerates and increases the scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact our brand image and result in diminished loyalty to our brand, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. this could have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and disrupt our ability to conduct our business, as well as damage our brand image with consumers. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant unanticipated compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. 16 table of contents if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by severe weather conditions, floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. if we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our results of operations, as well as our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could have a materially adverse impact on our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications, and these systems face similar risk of interruption or attack. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. we also rely on third parties for the operation of certain of our e-commerce websites, and do not control these service providers. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, vendor, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may 17 table of contents also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could negatively impact our results of operations. for example, in early 2018 an unauthorized third party acquired data associated with our connected fitness users' accounts for our myfitnesspal application and website. approximately 150 million user accounts were affected by this issue, and the affected information included usernames, email addresses and hashed passwords. a consumer class action lawsuit has been filed against us in connection with this incident, and we may face a number of legal claims or investigations by government regulators and agencies. we may also be required to incur additional expense to further enhance our data security infrastructure. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data. compliance with existing, proposed and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, called the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar or stricter measures. any of these factors could negatively impact our profitability, result in negative publicity and damage our brand image or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. we are in the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes, which began in 2015 and will continue in phases over the next few years. the first phase of this implementation became operational during 2017 in our north america, emea and connected fitness operations. the next phase of this implementation is planned to become operational in 2019 in our asia-pacific region, and we are in the process of developing an implementation strategy and roll-out plan for our latin american region. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-u.s. earnings for which we have not previously provided applicable withholding tax, u.s. state income taxes, or foreign exchange rate impacts. for example, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017, which had a significant impact to our provision for income taxes as of december 31, 2017 and december 31, 2018. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service, u.s. states taxing authorities, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. additionally, many of the countries in which we do business have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting final proposals from the organization for economic co-operation and development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. 18 table of contents we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, the expansion of our corporate headquarters, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments to support our digital strategy. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, chairman and chief executive officer and other top executives. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product design teams and other key employees. however, to be successful in continuing to profitably grow our business and manage our operations, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business and achieve our long term objectives. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our intellectual property rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, including our digital business. from 19 table of contents time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are subject to periodic claims, litigation and investigations that could result in unexpected expenses and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. given the size and extent of our global operations, we are involved in a variety of litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and may be subject to investigations, audits, inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry. for example, we are subject to an ongoing securities class action proceeding regarding our prior disclosures and derivative complaints regarding related matters, as well as past related party transactions, among other proceedings. we are also party to a consumer class action lawsuit filed in connection with our first quarter 2018 data security incident. refer to note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these specific matters. legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. any of our legal proceedings could result in damages, fines or other penalties, divert financial and management resources and result in significant legal fees. we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or our stock price. in addition, any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers or our shareholders, as well as our brand image. the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time. the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our non-voting class c common stock has traded at a discount to our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. 20 table of contents kevin plank, our chairman and chief executive officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our chairman and chief executive officer, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding and in other limited circumstances. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. item 1b. unresolved staff comments not applicable. 21 table of contents item 2. properties the following includes a summary of the principal properties that we own or lease as of december 31, 2018. our principal executive and administrative offices are located at an office complex in baltimore, maryland, which includes 400 thousand square

foot facility, with options to renew the lease term through december 2041. our rialto facility is a 1.2 million square foot facility with a lease term through may 2023. we believe our distribution facilities and space available through our third-party logistics providers will be adequate to meet our short term needs. in addition, as of december 31, 2018, we leased 319 brand and factory house stores located primarily in the united states, canada, china, chile and mexico with lease end dates in 2019 through 2033. we also lease additional office space for sales, quality assurance and sourcing, marketing, and administrative functions. we anticipate that we will be able to extend these leases that expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to other locations. item

condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this form 10-k under the captions risk factors, selected financial data, and business. overview we are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. the brand's moisture-wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. the under armour connected fitness strategy is focused on engaging with these consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our products. our net revenues grew to $5,193.2 million in 2018 from $3,084.4 million in 2014. we believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the under armour brand in the marketplace. our long-term growth strategy is focused on increased sales of our products through ongoing product innovation, investment in our distribution channels and international expansion. while we plan to continue to invest in growth, we also plan to improve efficiencies throughout our business as we seek to gain scale through our operations and return on our investments. financial highlights for full year 2018 as compared to the prior year period include: net revenues increased 4%. wholesale and direct-to-consumer revenues increased 3% and 4%, respectively. apparel revenue increased 5% compared to the prior year. footwear revenue increased 2% and accessories revenue decreased 5%. revenue in our north america segment declined 2%. revenue in our asia-pacific, emea and latin america segments grew 29%, 25% and 5%, respectively, with 18% growth in our connected fitness segment. selling, general and administrative expense increased 4%. gross margin was unchanged at 45.1%. a large majority of our products are sold in north america; however, we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. internationally, our net revenues are generated primarily from a mix of sales to retailers and distributors in our wholesale channel and sales through our direct to consumer channel in europe, latin america, and asia-pacific. we believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle. we believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. we also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non-performance products to performance products, which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin, helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort. we believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the united states, but are occurring in a number of markets globally, thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth, we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities or negatively impact our financial results, including, among others, the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers. additionally, we may not be able to successfully execute on our long-term strategies, or successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business effectively. although we have implemented restructuring plans, we may not fully realize the expected benefits of these plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives. in addition, we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner. furthermore, our industry is very competitive, and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability. we also rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers outside the u.s. to provide fabrics and to 28 table of contents produce our products, and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business. for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a. restructuring plans as previously announced, in both 2017 and 2018, our board of directors approved restructuring plans (the "2018 restructuring plan" and "2017 restructuring plan") designed to more closely align our financial resources with the critical priorities of our business and optimize operations. we recognized approximately $203.9 million of pre-tax charges in connection with our 2018 restructuring plan and approximately $129.1 million of pre-tax charges in connection with our 2017 restructuring plan, inclusive of $28.6 million of restructuring related goodwill impairment charges for our connected fitness business. the summary of the costs incurred during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, in connection with the 2018 and 2017 restructuring plans, respectively, are as follows: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 costs recorded in cost of goods sold: inventory write-offs $ 20,801 $ 5,077 total cost recorded in cost of goods sold 20,801 5,077 costs recorded in restructuring and impairment charges: impairment 12,146 71,378 employee related costs 9,949 14,572 contract exit costs 114,126 12,029 other restructuring costs 46,927 26,070 total costs recorded in restructuring and impairment charges 183,148 124,049 total restructuring, impairment and restructuring related costs $ 203,949 $ 129,126 2017 tax act the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017. we included reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate in our 2017 financial results. these changes include a one-time mandatory transition tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings and a re-measuring of deferred tax assets. as of december 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tax act. refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail. general net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and connected fitness revenues. net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us from licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on their products. our connected fitness revenues consist of digital advertising and subscriptions from our connected fitness business. cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. the fabrics in many of our products are made primarily of petroleum-based synthetic materials. therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. in general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear. a limited portion of cost of goods sold is associated with license and connected fitness revenues. we include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. as a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. these costs were $91.8 million, $101.5 million and $89.9 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 29 table of contents our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services. we consolidate our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other, which includes our selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services categories. personnel costs are included in these categories based on the employees' function. personnel costs include salaries, benefits, incentives and stock-based compensation related to our employees. our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth. marketing costs consist primarily of commercials, print ads, league, team, player and event sponsorships and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture program. other expense, net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries. 30 table of contents results of operations the following table

by: apparel unit sales growth driven by the train category; and footwear unit sales growth, led by the run category. the increase was partially offset by unit sales decline in accessories. license revenues increased $8.2 million, or 7.0%, to $124.8 million in 2018 from $116.6 million in 2017. connected fitness revenue increased $18.5 million, or 18.1%, to $120.4 million in 2018 from $101.9 million in 2017 primarily driven by increased subscribers on our fitness applications. gross profit increased $89.1 million to $2,340.5 million in 2018 from $2,251.4 million in 2017. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, was unchanged at 45.1% in 2018 compared to 2017. gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by lower promotional activity, improvements in product cost, lower air freight, higher proportion of international and connected fitness revenue and changes in foreign currency; these favorable impacts were offset by channel mix including higher sales to our off-price channel and restructuring related charges. with the exception of improvements in product input costs and air freight improvements, we do not expect these trends to have a material impact on the full year 2019. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $82.8 million to $2,182.3 million in 2018 from $2,099.5 million in 2017. as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 42.0% in 2018 from 42.1% in 2017. selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following: marketing costs decreased $21.3 million to $543.8 million in 2018 from $565.1 million in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to restructuring efforts, resulting in lower compensation and contractual sports marketing. this decrease was partially offset by higher costs in connection with brand marketing campaigns and increased marketing investments with the growth of our international business. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 10.5% in 2018 from 11.3% in 2017. other costs increased $104.1 million to $1,638.5 million in 2018 from $1,534.4 million in 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and higher costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel and international business. as a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 31.6% in 2018 from 30.8% in 2017. restructuring and impairment charges increased $59.1 million to $183.1 million from $124.0 million in 2017. refer to the restructuring plans section above for a summary of charges. income (loss) from operations decreased $52.8 million, or 189.9%, to a loss of $25.0 million in 2018 from income of $27.8 million in 2017. as a percentage of net revenues, income from operations decreased to a loss of 0.4% in 2018 from income of 0.5% in 2017. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $203.9 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2018 restructuring plan. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by $129.1 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2017 restructuring plan. interest expense, net decreased $0.9 million to $33.6 million in 2018 from $34.5 million in 2017. 32 table of contents other expense, net increased $5.6 million to $9.2 million in 2018 from $3.6 million in 2017. this increase was due to higher net loss on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies as compared to the prior period. provision for income taxes decreased $58.6 million to a benefit of $20.6 million in 2018 from an expense of $38.0 million in 2017. our effective tax rate was 30.3% in 2018 compared to (368.2)% in 2017. our effective tax rate for 2018, as compared to 2017, was positively impacted by a one-time tax benefit recorded in 2018 for an intercompany intangible asset sale and the decrease in a one-time tax charges due to the us tax act. these positive impacts were partially offset by the impact of the decrease in the u.s. federal rate applied to u.s. pre-tax losses in 2018. as of december 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the one-time tax effects of the enactment of the tax act, which resulted in a $1.5 million charge to income tax expense. this was comprised of $12.0 million of income tax expense related to the transition tax and $10.5 million of income tax benefit for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets for the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. year ended december 31, 2017 compared to year ended december 31, 2016 net revenues

revenues was driven primarily by increased distribution of our licensed products in north america. connected fitness revenue increased $13.4 million, or 15.2%, to $101.9 million in 2017 from $88.5 million in 2016 primarily driven by increased subscribers on our fitness applications and higher licensing revenue. gross profit increased $2.8 million to $2,251.4 million in 2017 from $2,248.6 million in 2016. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decreased 140 basis points to 45.1% in 2017 compared to 46.5% in 2016. the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following: a n approximate 190 basis point decrease due to inventory management efforts including higher promotions and increased air freight; and an approximate 20 basis point decrease due to our international business representing a higher percentage of sales; the above decreases were partially offset by: an approximate 50 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable product input costs; and an approximate 30 basis point increase driven primarily by favorable channel mix with increased sales in our direct-to-consumer channel. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $268.4 million to $2,099.5 million in 2017 from $1,831.1 million in 2016. as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 42.1% in 2017

million in 2016. this increase was primarily due to increased marketing spend in connection with the growth of our international business and in connection with our collegiate and professional athlete sponsorships. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs increased to 11.4% in 2017 from 9.9% in 2016. other costs increased $180.8 million to $1,534.4 million in 2017 from $1,353.6 million in

financial instruments as compared to the prior period. provision for income taxes decreased $93.3 million to $38.0 million in 2017 from $131.3 million in 2016. our effective tax rate was (368.2)% in 2017 compared to 33.8% in 2016. our effective tax rate for 2017 was lower than the effective tax rate for 2016 primarily due to the significant decrease in income before taxes, the impact of tax benefits recorded for our challenged u.s. results, and reductions in our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse in the statute of limitations during the current period. these benefits were partially offset by the impact of the tax act, non-deductible goodwill impairment charges, and the recording of certain valuation allowances. our provision for income taxes in 2017 included $38.8 million of income tax expense as a result of the tax act, including a $13.9 million charge for our provisional estimate of the transition tax and $24.9 million for the provisional

revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including our higher priced cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. the following table sets forth certain financial information for the periods indicated. the data is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. all recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below: quarter ended (unaudited) (in thousands) 3/31/2017 6/30/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 6/30/2018 9/30/2018

for working capital and capital expenditures. we fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowings available under our credit and long term debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities. our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the back half of the year. our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our new brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory 37 table of contents management. these systems and processes, including our new global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments and our ability to access the capital markets are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, an economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity (refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a). in addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all. at december 31, 2018, $165.1 million, or approximately 29.6%, of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states. in addition, our united states operations do not require the repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs. should we require additional capital in the united states, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states. the tax act provided for a one-time transition tax on indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings to transition u.s. international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system. we have completed our accounting and recorded all related tax liabilities for the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would not be subject to additional u.s. federal income tax, however, we would be required to accrue and pay any applicable withholding tax and u.s. state income tax liabilities and record foreign exchange rate impacts. determination of the unrecorded deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is not practicable. cash flows the following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 2016 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $ 628,230 $ 237,460 $ 366,623 investing activities (202,904) (282,987) (381,139) financing activities (189,868) 106,759 146,114 effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 12,467 4,178 (8,725) net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 247,925 $ 65,410 $ 122,873 operating activities operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. in addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses. cash flows provided by operating activities increased $390.8 million to $628.2 million in 2018 from $237.5 million in 2017. the increase was due to increased net cash inflows from operating assets and liabilities of $489.6 million. the increase in cash inflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following: a n increase in cash provided by accounts receivable of $265.9 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to timing of shipments within the fourth quarter; and a n increase in cash provided by inventory of $332.3 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily due to increased sales to our off-price channel and improved inventory management efforts. 38 table of contents this was partially offset by a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $100.8 million year over year. cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $129.2 million to $237.5 million of cash provided by operating activities in 2017 from $366.6 million of cash provided by operating activities in 2016. the decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in net income of $305.2 million. this decrease was partially offset by a smaller decrease in accounts receivable of $170.1 million. investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased $80.1 million to $202.9 million in 2018 from $283.0 million in 2017, primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2018, partially offset by the purchase of an additional 10% common stock ownership in dome corporation ("dome"), our japanese licensee. cash used in investing activities decreased $98.2 million to $283.0 million in 2017 from $381.1 million in 2016, primarily due to lower capital expenditures in 2017. total capital expenditures were $154.3 million, $274.9 million, and $405.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. capital expenditures for 2019 are expected to be approximately $210.0 million. financing activities cash used in financing activities increased $296.6 million to $189.9 million in 2018 from cash provided by financing activities of $106.8 million in 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher net repayments on our credit facility in the current period compared to the prior period, along with the early repayment of our recourse loan related to our corporate headquarters. cash provided by financing activities decreased $39.4 million to $106.8 million in 2017 from $146.1 million in 2016. this decrease was primarily due to repayments on our revolving credit facility. credit facility we are party to a credit agreement that provides revolving commitments for up to $1.25 billion of borrowings, as well as term loan commitments, in each case maturing in january 2021. as of december 31, 2018 there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and $136.3 million of term loan borrowings remained outstanding. in january 2019, we prepaid the outstanding balance of $136.3 million on our term loan, without penalty. at our request and the lender's consent, revolving and or term loan borrowings may be increased by up to $300.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, as amended. incremental borrowings are uncommitted and the availability thereof will depend on market conditions at the time we seek to incur such borrowings. the borrowings under the revolving credit facility have maturities of less than one year. up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. there were $4.6 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2018. the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge our assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. we are also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00 and is not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 ("consolidated leverage ratio"). as of december 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these ratios. in the past, we have amended our credit agreement to increase these ratios in certain quarterly periods. specifically, in 2018 we amended the credit agreement to increase these ratios for the second and third quarters of 2018. in addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made ( adjusted libor ), plus in each case an applicable margin. the applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the pricing grid ) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between 1.00% to 1.25% for adjusted libor loans and 0.00% to 0.25% for alternate base rate loans. the weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans was 3.2% and 2.2% during 39 table of contents the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. the weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit facility borrowings was 3.0% and 2.2% during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit. as of december 31, 2018, the commitment fee was 15 basis points. since inception, we incurred and deferred $3.9 million in financing costs in connection with the credit agreement. 3.250% senior notes in june 2016, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due june 15, 2026 (the notes ). the proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. interest is payable semi-annually on june 15 and december 15 beginning december 15, 2016. prior to march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or a make-whole amount applicable to such notes as described in the indenture governing the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. on or after march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. the indenture governing the notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture. we incurred and deferred $5.3 million in financing costs in connection with the notes. other long term debt in december 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising our corporate headquarters. in july 2018, this loan was paid in full, without penalties, using borrowings under our revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2017, the outstanding balance on the loan was $40.0 million. interest expense, net was $33.6 million, $34.5 million, and $26.4 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities. amortization of deferred financing costs was $1.5 million, $1.3 million, and $1.2 million for the years ended december 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. we monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities. contractual commitments and contingencies we lease warehouse space, office facilities, space for our brand and factory house stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. the leases expire at various dates through 2033, excluding extensions at our option, and include provisions for rental adjustments. in addition, this table includes executed lease agreements for brand and factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of december 31, 2018. the operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time. our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2018 as well as significant agreements entered into during the period after december 31, 2018 through the date of this report are summarized in the following table: payments due by period (in thousands) total less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years more than 5 years contractual obligations long term debt obligations (1) $ 746,250 $ 19,500 $ 39,000 $ 39,000 $ 648,750 lease obligations (2) 1,413,826 142,648 302,612 269,304 699,262 product purchase obligations (3) 707,512 707,512 sponsorships and other (4) 734,869 126,221 208,324 189,690 210,634 total $ 3,602,457 $ 995,881 $ 549,936 $ 497,994 $ 1,558,646 40 table of contents (1) includes estimated interest payments based on applicable fixed and currently effective floating interest rates as of december 31, 2018, timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations. in january 2019, we prepaid the full outstanding balance of $136.3 million on our term loan, without penalty. (2) includes the minimum payments for lease obligations. the lease obligations do not include any contingent rent expense we may incur at our brand and factory house stores based on future sales above a specified minimum or payments made for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. contingent rent expense was $13.0 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. (3) we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales. the amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders with our manufacturers for our apparel, footwear and accessories, including expected inbound freight, duties and other costs. these open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable prices. the product purchase obligations also includes fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of december 31, 2018. (4) includes sponsorships with professional teams, professional leagues, colleges and universities, individual athletes, athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our brand. some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations. it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. the amount of product provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. in addition, it is not possible to determine the performance incentive amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based and other variables. the amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these sponsorship agreements. additionally, these amounts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments to endorsers and licensors based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. the table above excludes a liability of $52.5 million for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions. off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad faith. based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. to prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. we believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. it is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended december 31, 2018. 41 table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to accounting standards codification 606 ("asc 606"). net revenues consist of net sales and license and connected fitness revenue. net sales are recognized upon transfer of control, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. payment is due in full when title is transferred. transfer of title and risk of loss is based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. in some instances, transfer of title and risk of loss takes place at the point of sale, for example, at our brand and factory house stores. we may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. license revenue is primarily recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees. sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis on the consolidated statements of income, and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold. we record reductions to revenue at the time of the transaction for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. we base these estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. the actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which are inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. if we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination. provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers. reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are included within customer refund liability and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. as of december 31, 2018 there were $301.4 million in reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts within customer refund liability and $113.9 million as the estimated value of inventory associated with the reserves for sales returns within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. as of december 31, 2017, there were $246.6 million in reserves for customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts within accounts receivable, net. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of revenue recognition. allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. in determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates. if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. in the event we determine a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination was made. as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $22.2 million and $19.7 million, respectively. inventory valuation and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods. costs of finished goods inventories include all costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including inbound freight, duties and other costs. we value our inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. net realizable value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. if we determine that the estimated net realizable value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those that we projected, further adjustments may be required that would increase the cost of goods sold in the period in which such a determination was made. goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are allocated to the reporting units that are expected to receive the related benefits. goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. in conducting an annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of 42 table of contents the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if factors indicate that is the case, we perform the goodwill impairment test. we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. we calculate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, which indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business, and working capital effects. if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, goodwill is impaired to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. as of our annual impairment test, no impairment of goodwill was identified and the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our latin america reporting unit. the fair value of the latin america reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 14%. holding all other assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the latin america reporting unit constant, a 1% point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital would eliminate the headroom; whereas, a reduction in the growth rate of revenue by 1% point would still result in excess fair value over carrying value. no events occurred during the period ended december 31, 2018 that indicated it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired. in 2017, we recorded goodwill impairment of $28.6 million related to our connected fitness reporting unit. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of goodwill. we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows. when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. if future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value.in 2017, we recorded impairment charges of $12.1 million related to our connected fitness reporting unit. equity method investment on april 23, 2018, we invested 4.2 billion or $39.2 million in exchange for an additional 10% common stock ownership in dome corporation ("dome"), our japanese licensee. this additional investment brings our total investment in dome's common stock to 29.5%, from 19.5%. we accounted for our investment in dome under the equity method, given that we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over dome. as of december 31, 2018, the carrying value of our total investment in dome was $52.8 million. our proportionate share of dome's net assets exceeded our total investment by $63.8 million and is not amortized. for the year ended december 31, 2018, we recorded the allocable share of dome's net income in our consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the invested balance. in addition to the investment in dome, we have a license agreement with dome. we recorded license revenues from dome of $35.6 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. as of december 31, 2018, we have$13.1 million in licensing receivables outstanding, recorded in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line item within our consolidated balance sheet. income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made. a significant portion of our deferred tax assets relate to u.s. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future pre-tax earnings in the united states. due to our challenged results in the united states we incurred significant pre-tax losses in these jurisdictions in 2017 and 2018. based on these factors, we have evaluated our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets in future years. in evaluating the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at december 31, 2018, we have considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following: 43 table of contents positive 2018 taxable income in the u.s. and certain state jurisdictions; no material definite lived tax attributes subject to future expiration; no history of u.s. federal and state tax attributes expiring unused ; three year cumulative u.s. federal and state pre-tax income plus tax permanent differences; relatively low values of pre-tax income required to realize deferred tax assets relative to historic income levels; restructuring plans undertaken in 2017 and 2018 to improve future profitability; availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. reversal of deferred tax liabilities and timing thereof negative inherent challenges in forecasting future pre-tax earnings which rely , in part, on improved profitability from our restructuring efforts; the continuing challenge of changes in the u.s. consumer retail business environment; as of december 31, 2018, we believe that the weight of the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence regarding the realization of the majority of the net deferred tax assets. we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements. as of december 31, 2018, we had $99.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.76 years. this unrecognized compensation expense does not include any expense related to performance-based restricted stock units and stock options for which the performance targets have not been deemed probable as of december 31, 2018. the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. in addition, compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance targets are deemed probable, which requires management judgment. the achievement of operating income targets related to the performance-based restricted stock units and stock options granted in 2018 were deemed probable as of december 31, 2018. refer to note 2 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock-based compensation. recently issued accounting standards refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for our assessment of recently issued accounting standards. 44 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. as our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, as we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and inventory purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. these exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations. from time to time, we may elect to use foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations primarily on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our international subsidiaries. as we expand our international business, we anticipate expanding our current hedging program to include additional currency pairs and instruments. we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. as of december 31, 2018, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts was $671.2 million, which was primarily comprised of canadian dollar/u.s. dollar, pound sterling/u.s. dollar, euro/u.s. dollar, mexican peso/u.s. dollar and chinese renminbi/u.s. dollar currency pairs with contract maturities of one to fourteen months. the majority of our foreign currency contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. we enter into foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges. for foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value, excluding any ineffective portion, is recorded in other comprehensive income until net income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the hedged transaction. the effective portion is generally released to net income after the maturity of the related derivative and is classified in the same manner as the underlying exposure. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we reclassified $1.3 million and $0.4 million from other comprehensive income to cost of goods sold related to foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, respectively. the fair value of our foreign currency contracts was an asset of $19.5 million as of december 31, 2018 and was included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. the fair value of our foreign currency contracts was a liability of $6.8 million as of december 31, 2017 and was included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements. included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency contracts: (in thousands) year ended december 31, 2018 2017 2016 unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) $ 14,023 $ 29,246 $ (12,627) realized foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) 11,462 611 (6,906) unrealized derivative gains (losses) (109) (1,217) 729 realized derivative gains (losses) (14,712) (26,537) 15,192 we enter into foreign currency contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. interest rate risk i n order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations. 45 table of contents we utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt. the contracts pay fixed and receive variable rates of interest. the interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges and accordingly, the effective portion of the changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense over the life of the underlying debt obligation. as of december 31, 2018, the notional value of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts was $118.1 million. during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a $0.4 million decrease and $0.9 million increase in interest expense, respectively, representing the effective portion of the contracts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of $1.6 million and $1.1 million as of december 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were included in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet. in january 2019, we settled our interest rate swap contract in connection with the prepayment of our term loan. credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2018. refer to "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies and estimates - allowance for doubtful accounts" for further discussion on our policies. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in recent periods, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 46 table of contentsrisk

affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, unemployment, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in the united states, china or other key markets, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2019, sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 60% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations. we may not successfully execute our long-term strategies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. our ability to execute on our long-term strategies depends, in part, on successfully executing on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. our ability to invest in these growth initiatives would be negatively impacted if we are unable to grow net revenues in our international business at the rate we expect, or if our north america business, which represented 69% of our total net revenues in 2019, continues to decline or experiences significant market disruption. in addition, our long-term strategy depends on our ability to successfully drive expansion of our gross margins, manage our cost structure and drive return on our investments. if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected results of operations. 9 table of contents we may not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability. in 2017 and 2018 we executed restructuring plans designed to more closely align our financial resources against the critical priorities of our business, and in february 2020, we announced that we are evaluating a potential restructuring plan for 2020. our past plans included initiatives to improve operational efficiencies in targeted areas of our business, and included reductions in our global workforce. we may not achieve the operational improvements and efficiencies that we targeted in our past restructuring plans, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. the 2020 restructuring plan we are evaluating includes the potential decision to forego a flagship store in new york city while pursuing sublet options, in addition to further targeted cost saving measures we are assessing. if we fail to adopt a restructuring plan, our ability to optimize our cost structure will be negatively impacted. in addition, implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements and/or cost reductions. these risks include, among others, higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans, damage to our reputation and brand image and workforce attrition beyond planned reductions. if we fail to achieve targeted operating improvements and/or cost reductions, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health or political crises or other catastrophic events. we operate retail, distribution and warehousing facilities and offices across the world, and in locations subject to natural disasters or extreme weather conditions, as well as other potential catastrophic events, such as public health emergencies, terrorist attacks or political or military conflict. the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt our operations and negatively impact sales of our products. our customers and suppliers also manage global operations and could experience similar disruption. in addition, an occurrence of these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted region or, depending on the severity, globally, which could negatively impact our results of operations. for example, in december 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china, resulting in store closures and a decrease in consumer traffic in china, as well as potential delays in the manufacturing and shipment of products and raw materials to and from china. to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the production and packaging of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. we expect the coronavirus to negatively impact our results of operations, particularly our asia-pacific segment, though the extent and duration of this impact remain uncertain and may have a material negative impact on our results of operations. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences, successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products or engage our consumers, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. our failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products or design products in the categories and styles that consumers want, demand for our products could decline and our brand image could be negatively impacted. if we experience problems with the quality of our products, our brand reputation may be negatively 10 table of contents impacted and we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems, which could negatively impact our results of operations. consumer shopping preferences and shifts in distribution channels continue to evolve and could negatively impact our results of operations or our future growth. consumer preferences regarding the shopping experience continue to rapidly evolve. we sell our products through a variety of channels, including through wholesale customers and distribution partners, as well as our own direct to consumer business consisting of our brand and factory house stores and e-commerce platforms. if we or our wholesale customers do not provide consumers with an attractive in-store experience, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted. in addition, as part of our strategy to grow our e-commerce revenue, we are investing significantly in enhancing our platform capabilities and implementing systems to drive higher engagement with our consumers. if we do not successfully execute this strategy or continue to provide an engaging and user-friendly digital commerce platform that attracts consumers, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted as well as our opportunities for future growth. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. we generate a significant portion of our wholesale revenues from sales to our largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with our key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation, particularly in the sports specialty sector. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to continue to grow our net revenues, or our net revenues may decline. we must successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business, or our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and we must continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during the last two quarters of the year, which historically has been our peak season. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; 11 table of contents product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results. sales of performance products may not continue to grow or may decline, which could negatively impact our sales and our ability to grow our business. if consumers are not convinced performance apparel, footwear and accessories are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow or rather decline, our sales could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected financial results. in addition, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. our results of operations are affected by the performance of our equity investment, over which we do not exercise control. we maintain a minority investment in our japanese licensee, which we account for under the equity method, and are required to recognize our allocable share of its net income or loss in our consolidated financial statements. in addition, our results of operations are impacted by the licensee's performance under the license agreement. our results of operations are affected by the performance of that business, over which we do not exercise control, and in 2019, our net income was negatively impacted by losses realized by that business. we are also required to regularly review our investment for impairment, and an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of adverse events or management decisions that impact the fair value or estimated future cash flows to be generated from our investment. in the fourth quarter of 2019, we impaired our investment and recognized a $39.0 million charge as a result. while the carrying value of our investment has been significantly reduced as a result of this impairment, we may be required to further impair our investment in the future. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in products similar to ours and private label offerings of certain retailers, 12 table of contents including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies has been to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers have better sell through or earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline or our growth may be negatively impacted as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. in addition, our ability to achieve short-term growth targets may be negatively impacted if we are unwilling to engage in promotional activity on a scale similar to that of our competitors and we are unable to simultaneously offset declining promotional activity with increased sales at premium price points. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could negatively impact our brand image. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide raw materials for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. 13 table of contents many of the materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2019, 10 manufacturers produced approximately 52% of our apparel and accessories products, and 6 produced approximately 96% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. a significant element of our future growth strategy depends on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2019, 69% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices in certain regions outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in those markets. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources and may be more costly than we expect. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of more limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to successfully grow our business outside north america would negatively impact our ability to achieve our near-term and long-term growth targets. our financial results and ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted by economic, regulatory and political risks beyond our control. substantially all of our manufacturers are located outside of the united states and an increasing amount of our net revenue is generated by sales in our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: 14 table of contents political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; uncertainties and the ongoing effect of the united kingdom's withdraw from the european union; actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities impacting trade and foreign investment, particularly during periods of heightened tension between u.s. and foreign governments, including the imposition of new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties, trade restrictions or restrictions on the transfer of funds; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our stores, customers, manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could hamper our ability to sell products in international markets, negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials and increase our cost of doing business generally, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, or if we are required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill, it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, we may not realize the financial benefits or other synergies we anticipated. in addition, in connection with our acquisitions, we may record goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. we have recognized goodwill impairment charges in the past. if an acquired business does not produce results consistent with financial models used in our analysis of an acquisition, or if reporting units carrying goodwill do not meet our current expectations of future growth rates or market factors outside of our control change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. as of december 31, 2019, the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our latin america reporting unit. while no events have occurred that indicated it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired, an impairment may be required in the future if our current expectations for this reporting unit are not met. our credit agreement contains financial covenants, and both our credit agreement and debt securities contain other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. our debt securities limit our ability to, subject to certain significant exceptions, incur secured debt and engage in sale leaseback transactions. our credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement, and in the past we have amended our credit agreement to increase these ratios in certain quarterly periods. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement or our debt securities could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations (including our debt securities) will be considered an 15 table of contents event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. our debt securities include a cross acceleration provision which provides that the acceleration of certain other debt obligations (including our credit agreement) will be considered an event of default under our debt securities and, subject to certain time and notice periods, give bondholders the right to accelerate our debt securities. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. our credit ratings have been downgraded previously, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. in addition, the u.k. financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. our credit agreement permits us to borrow based on an adjusted libor rate, plus an applicable margin. while the credit agreement provides for a mechanism for determining an alternative interest rate following this phase out, uncertainty regarding alternative rates may make borrowing under our credit agreement or refinancing our other indebtedness more expensive or difficult to achieve on terms we consider favorable. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to the mix of our products sold during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. our quarterly results may also vary based on the timing of customer orders. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. we generated approximately 28% of our consolidated net revenues outside the united states. as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than 16 table of contents their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our business could be adversely impacted if negative publicity regarding our brand, our company or our business partners diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, while we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct, we do not control their practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. these and other types of negative publicity, especially through social media which potentially accelerates and increases the scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact our brand image and result in diminished loyalty to our brand, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. this could have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and disrupt our ability to conduct our business, as well as damage our brand image with consumers. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant unanticipated compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. 17 table of contents if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses or malware, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by severe weather conditions, floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties. this includes the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities, as well as partnering with third party distribution facilities in certain regions where we do not maintain our own facilities. from time to time, certain of our partners have experienced disruptions to their operations, including cyber-related disruptions. if we or our partners encounter such problems, our results of operations, as well as our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses or malware, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could have a materially adverse impact on our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications, and these systems face similar risk of interruption or attack. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. we also rely on third parties for the operation of certain of our e-commerce websites, and do not control these service providers. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, vendor, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or 18 table of contents cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could negatively impact our results of operations. for example, in early 2018 an unauthorized third party acquired data associated with our connected fitness users' accounts for our myfitnesspal application and website. approximately 150 million user accounts were affected by this issue, and the affected information included usernames, email addresses and hashed passwords. we continue to face legal proceedings in connection with this incident, and we may face claims or investigations by government regulators and agencies. we may also be required to incur additional expense to further enhance our data security infrastructure. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data. compliance with existing, proposed and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, called the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar or stricter measures. for example, in january 2020, the california consumer privacy act took effect, and establishes transparency roles and creates new data privacy rights for consumers. any of these factors could negatively impact our profitability, result in negative publicity and damage our brand image or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. in 2015, we began the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system, sap fashion management solution ("fms"), as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. the first phase of this implementation became operational during 2017 in our north america, emea and connected fitness operations. the next phase of this implementation became operational in 2019 in our asia-pacific region, and we are currently in the process of implementing fms in our latin american region, which is expected to become operational in 2020. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-u.s. earnings for which we have not previously provided applicable foreign withholding taxes, certain u.s. state income taxes, or foreign exchange rate impacts. for example, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017, which had a significant impact to our provision for income taxes. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service, and u.s. states taxing authorities could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. 19 table of contents additionally, we engage in multiple types of intercompany transactions, and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements are subject to review by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities. although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our tax provision. moreover, the organization for economic co-operation and development and many of the countries in which we do business continue to evaluate changes to tax laws which could significantly impact the allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries and impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates. we regularly assess all these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments to support our digital strategy. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, executive chairman and brand chief and patrik frisk, our chief executive officer and president and other top executives. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. to be successful in continuing to profitably grow our business and manage our operations, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business and achieve our long term objectives. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture the majority of our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. 20 table of contents our intellectual property rights and product offerings could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, including our digital business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are the subject of a number of ongoing legal proceedings that have resulted in significant expense, and adverse developments in our ongoing proceedings and/or future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. we are currently involved in a variety of litigation, investigations and other legal matters and may be subject to additional investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. for example, we are subject to an ongoing securities class action proceeding regarding our prior disclosures and derivative complaints regarding related matters, as well as past related party transactions, among other proceedings. refer to note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these specific matters. in addition, as previously disclosed in november 2019, we have been responding to requests for documents and information from the u.s. securities and exchange commission and department of justice regarding certain of our accounting practices and related disclosures. legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, or whether ongoing investigations will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in enforcement actions, charges or material damages, fines or other penalties. an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or 21 table of contents our stock price. any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers or our shareholders. furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our brand image. the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time. the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our non-voting class c common stock has traded at a discount to our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. kevin plank, our executive chairman and brand chief controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our executive chairman and brand chief, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. under certain circumstances, the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock, which would also result in the conversion of our class c common stock into class a common stock. as specified in our charter, these circumstances include when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding, if mr. plank were to resign as an approved executive officer of the company (or was otherwise terminated for cause) or if mr. plank sells more than a specified number of any class of our common stock within a one-year period. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 item 8

distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. the brand's performance apparel and footwear are engineered in many designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and are worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. we generate net revenues from the sale of our products globally to national, regional, independent and specialty wholesalers and distributors. we also generate net revenue from the sale of our products through our direct to consumer sales channel, which includes our brand and factory house stores and e-commerce websites. in addition, we generate net revenues through product licensing, digital fitness subscriptions and digital advertising on our connected fitness applications. a majority of our products are sold in north america; however we believe that our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. our digital strategy is focused on supporting these long term objectives, emphasizing the connection and engagement with our consumers through multiple digital touch points, including through our connected fitness business. we were incorporated as a maryland corporation in 1996. as used in this report, the terms we, our, us, under armour and the company refer to under armour, inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. we have registered trademarks around the globe, including under armour , heatgear , coldgear , ua hovr and the under armour ua logo, and we have applied to register many other trademarks. this annual report on form 10-k also contains additional trademarks and tradenames of our company and our subsidiaries. all trademarks and tradenames appearing in this annual report on form 10-k are the property of their respective holders. products our product offerings consist of apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. we market our products at multiple price levels and provide consumers with products that we believe are a superior alternative to traditional athletic products. in 2019, sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 66%, 21% and 8% of net revenues, respectively. licensing arrangements and revenue from our connected fitness business represented the remaining 5% of net revenues. refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for net revenues by product. apparel our apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility, regulate body temperature and improve performance regardless of weather conditions. our apparel is engineered to replace traditional non-performance fabrics in the world of athletics and fitness with performance alternatives designed and merchandised with a variety of innovative techniques and product styles. our highly technical products extend primarily across the sporting goods, outdoor and active lifestyle markets. we market our apparel for consumers to provide a benefit you never knew you needed, but can't imagine living without, including heatgear to wear when it is hot, coldgear to wear when it is cold, or our rush or recover designed to increase blood flow. our apparel comes in three primary fit types: compression (tight fit), fitted (athletic fit) and loose (relaxed). heatgear is designed to be worn in warm to hot temperatures under equipment or as a single layer. while a sweat-soaked traditional non-performance t-shirt can weigh two to three pounds, heatgear is engineered with a microfiber blend designed to wick moisture from the body which helps the body stay cool, dry and light. we offer heatgear in a variety of tops and bottoms in a broad array of colors and styles for wear in the gym or outside in warm weather. coldgear is designed to wick moisture from the body while circulating body heat from hot spots to help maintain core body temperature. our coldgear apparel provides both dryness and warmth in a single

and mapmyride. license we have agreements with licensees to develop certain under armour apparel, accessories and equipment. in order to maintain consistent quality and performance, our product, marketing, sales and quality assurance teams are involved in substantially all steps of the design and go to market process in order to maintain brand and compliance standards and consistency. during 2019, our licensees offered collegiate, national football league ("nfl") and national basketball association ("nba") apparel and accessories, baby and youth apparel, team uniforms, socks, water bottles, eyewear and other specific hard goods equipment that feature performance advantages and functionality similar to our other product offerings. marketing and promotion we currently focus on marketing our products to consumers primarily for use in athletics, fitness, and training activities and as part of an active lifestyle. we seek to drive consumer demand by building brand awareness that our products deliver advantages to help athletes perform better. sports marketing our marketing and promotion strategy begins with providing and selling our products to high-performing athletes and teams at the high school, collegiate and professional levels. we execute this strategy through outfitting agreements, professional, club, and collegiate sponsorship, individual athlete and influencer agreements and by providing and selling our products directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. we also seek to sponsor and host consumer events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level by hosting combines, camps and clinics for young athletes in many sports. as a result, our products are seen on the field and on the court, and by various consumer audiences through the internet, television, magazines and live at sporting events. this exposure to consumers helps us establish on-field authenticity as consumers can see our products being worn by high-performing athletes. we are the official outfitter of athletic teams in several high-profile collegiate conferences. we are an official supplier of footwear and gloves to the nfl and a partner with the nba which allows us to market our nba athletes in game uniforms in connection with our products, including basketball footwear. we sponsor and sell our products to international sports teams, which helps to drive brand awareness in various countries and regions around the world. media we feature our products in a variety of national digital, broadcast, and print media outlets. we also utilize social and mobile media to engage consumers and promote connectivity with our brand and our products. for example, in 2019, we had a digitally led marketing approach for the launch of our ua hovr run franchise, which included a variety of content on various social media platforms. 2 table of contents retail presentation the primary goal of our retail marketing strategy is to increase brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. the design and funding of under armour point of sale displays and concept shops within our major retail accounts has been a key initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our brand. under armour point of sale displays and concept shops enhance our brand's presentation within our major retail accounts with a shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images. sales and distribution the majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels, which include national and regional sporting goods chains, independent and specialty retailers, department store chains, institutional athletic departments and leagues and teams. in various countries where we do not have direct sales operations, we sell our products to independent distributors or we engage licensees to sell our products. we also sell our products directly to consumers through our own network of brand and factory house stores and through e-commerce websites globally. factory house store products are specifically designed for sale in our factory house stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing us to sell a portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products, while maintaining the pricing integrity of our brand in our other distribution channels. through our brand house stores, consumers experience the premium full expression of our brand while having broader access to our performance products. in 2019, sales through our wholesale, direct to consumer, licensing and connected fitness channels represented 60%, 34%, 3% and 3% of net revenues, respectively. we believe the trend toward performance products is global and plan to continue to introduce our products and simple merchandising story to athletes throughout the world. we are introducing our performance products and services outside of north america in a manner consistent with our past brand-building strategy, including selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes in these markets, thereby providing us with product exposure to broad audiences of potential consumers. our primary business operates in four geographic segments: (1) north america, comprising the united states and canada, (2) europe, the middle east and africa ("emea"), (3) asia-pacific, and (4) latin america. each of these geographic segments operate predominantly in one industry: the development, marketing and distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. we also operate our connected fitness business as a separate segment. effective january 1, 2019, we changed the way we internally analyze the business and exclude certain corporate costs from our segment profitability measures. we now report these costs within corporate other, which is designed to provide increased transparency and comparability of our operating segments. prior year amounts have been recast to conform to the 2019 presentation. these changes have no impact on previously reported consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, or cash flows. corporate other consists largely of general and administrative expenses not allocated to an operating segment, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments such as global marketing, global it, global supply chain, innovation and other corporate support functions; costs related to our global assets and global marketing, costs related to our headquarters; restructuring and restructuring related charges; and certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses. our north america segment accounted for approximately 69% of our net revenues for 2019. approximately 28% of our net revenues were generated from our international segments in 2019. approximately 3% of our net revenues were generated from our connected fitness segment in 2019. no customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in 2019. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term in part through continued expansion in new and established international markets. refer to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for net revenues by segment. north america we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories in north america through our wholesale and direct to consumer channels. net revenues generated from the sales of our products in the united states were $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. our direct to consumer sales are generated through our brand and factory house stores and e-commerce website. as of december 31, 2019, we had 169 factory house stores in north america primarily located in outlet 3 table of contents centers throughout the united states. as of december 31, 2019, we had 19 brand house stores in north america. consumers can purchase our products directly from our e-commerce website, www.underarmour.com. in addition, we earn licensing revenue in north america based on our licensees' sale of collegiate apparel and accessories, as well as sales of other licensed products. we distribute the majority of our products sold to our north american wholesale customers and our own retail stores and e-commerce businesses from distribution facilities we lease and operate in california, maryland and tennessee. in addition, we distribute our products in north america through third-party logistics providers with primary locations in canada, new jersey and florida. in some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from the factories that manufacture our products directly to customer-designated facilities. emea we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories primarily through wholesale customers, independent distributors, e-commerce websites, and brand and factory house stores within europe. we also sell our branded products to various sports clubs and teams in europe. we generally distribute our products to our retail customers and e-commerce consumers in europe through a third-party logistics provider in the netherlands. we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories through independent distributors in the middle east, africa and russia. asia-pacific we sell our apparel, footwear and accessories products in china, south korea and australia through stores operated by our distribution and wholesale partners, along with e-commerce websites and brand and factory house stores we operate. we also sell our products to distributors in new zealand, india, taiwan, hong kong and other countries in southeast asia where we do not have direct sales operations. we distribute our products in asia-pacific through third-party logistics providers based in hong kong, china, south korea, australia and india. we have a license agreement with dome corporation, which produces, markets and sells our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in japan. our branded products are sold in japan to large sporting goods retailers, independent specialty stores and professional sports teams, and through licensee-owned retail stores. we hold an equity method investment in dome. latin america we sell our products in mexico and chile through wholesale customers, e-commerce websites and brand and factory house stores. in these countries we operate through third-party distribution facilities. in other latin american countries we distribute our products through independent distributors which are sourced primarily through our international distribution hub in panama. we have a license and distribution agreement with a third party that sells our products in brazil. connected fitness we offer digital fitness subscriptions, along with digital advertising through our mapmyfitness, myfitnesspal and endomondo platforms. our mapmyfitness platform includes applications, such as mapmyrun and mapmyride. we engage this community by developing innovative services and other digital solutions to impact how athletes and fitness-minded individuals train, perform and live. seasonality historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the calendar year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, including a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. product design and development our products are developed in collaboration with our product development teams and manufactured with technical fabrications produced by third parties. this approach enables us to select and create superior, technically advanced materials, curated to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on style, performance and fit. with a mission to make athletes better, we seek to deliver superior performance in all products. our developers proactively identify opportunities to create and improve performance products that meet the evolving 4 table of contents needs of our consumer. we design products with consumer-valued technologies, utilizing color, texture and fabrication to enhance our consumers perception and understanding of product use and benefits. our product development team works closely with our sports marketing and sales teams as well as professional and collegiate athletes to identify product trends and determine market needs. for example, these teams worked closely to identify the opportunity and market for our coldgear infrared product, which is a ceramic print technology on the inside of our garments that provides athletes with lightweight warmth, and ua hovr , a proprietary underfoot cushioning wrapped in a mesh web, equipped with a mapmyrun powered sensor designed to deliver energy return and real-time coaching. sourcing, manufacturing and quality assurance many of the specialty fabrics and other raw materials used in our apparel products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short term, from a limited number of sources. the fabric and other raw materials used to manufacture our apparel products are sourced by our contracted manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us . in 2019, approximately 42% of the fabric used in our apparel products came from 5 suppliers. these fabric suppliers have primary locations in taiwan, china, malaysia, united states and vietnam. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. we also use cotton in some of our apparel products, as a blended fabric and also in our charged cotton line. cotton is a commodity that is subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. additionally, our footwear uses raw materials that are sourced from a diverse base of third party suppliers. this includes chemicals and petroleum-based components such as rubber that are also subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers. in 2019, our apparel and accessories products were manufactured by 37 primary contract manufacturers, operating in 15 countries, with approximately 55% of our apparel and accessories products manufactured in jordan, vietnam, china and malaysia. of our 37 primary contract manufacturers, 10 produced approximately 52% of our apparel and accessories products. in 2019, our footwear products were manufactured by six primary contract manufacturers, operating primarily in vietnam, china and indonesia. these six primary contract manufacturers produced approximately 96% of our footwear products. all manufacturers across all product divisions are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our internal teams prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. we also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of goods sold. we enter into a variety of agreements with our contract manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing, working conditions and other social concerns. we do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products for the long term. we have subsidiaries strategically located near our key partners to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for our products. we also manufacture a limited number of products, primarily for high-profile athletes and teams, on-premises in our quick turn, special make-up shop located at one of our facilities in maryland. inventory management inventory management is important to the financial condition and operating results of our business. we manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. these systems and processes, including our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. our practice, and the general practice in the apparel, footwear and accessory industries, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. as it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. 5 table of contents intellectual property we believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products, both domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. our major trademarks include the ua logo and under armour , both of which are registered in the united states, canada, mexico, the european union, japan, china and numerous other countries. we also own trademark registrations for other trademarks including, among others, ua , armour , heatgear , coldgear , protect this house , i will , and many trademarks that incorporate the term armour such as armourbox , armour fleece, and armour bra . we also own registrations to protect our connected fitness branding such as myfitnesspal , mapmyfitness and associated mapmy marks and under armour connected fitness . we own domain names for our primary trademarks (most notably underarmour.com and ua.com) and hold copyright registrations for several commercials, as well as for certain artwork. we intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. we will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally. we believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our products from those of others. these trademarks are among our most valuable assets. in addition to our distinctive trademarks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, and we believe our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace. we traditionally have had limited patent protection on some of the technology, materials and processes used in the manufacture of our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments. as we continue to expand and drive innovation in our products, we seek patent protection on products, features and concepts we believe to be strategic and important to our business. we will continue to file patent applications where we deem appropriate to protect our new products, innovations and designs that align with our corporate strategy. we expect the number of applications to increase as our business grows and as we continue to expand our products and innovate. competition the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. many of the fabrics and technology used in manufacturing our products are not unique to us, and we own a limited number of fabric or process patents. some of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition and significantly greater resources than us, such as nike and adidas. we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in performance apparel and footwear, and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. in addition, we must compete with others for purchasing decisions, as well as limited floor space at retailers. we believe we have been successful in this area because of the relationships we have developed and the strong sales of our products. however, if retailers earn higher margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. we believe we have been able to compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our products and our selective distribution policies. we also believe our focused product style merchandising story differentiates us from our competition. in the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and expect that we may face greater competition on pricing. this may favor larger competitors with lower production costs per unit that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. the purchasing decisions of consumers for our products often reflect highly subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements and changing styles. 6 table of contents employees as of december 31, 2019, we had approximately 16,400 employees, including approximately 11,300 in our brand and factory house stores and approximately 1,500 at our distribution facilities. approximately 7,000 of our employees were full-time. most of our employees are located in the united states. none of our employees in the united states are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there are no material collective bargaining agreements in effect in any of our international locations. we have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relations with our employees are good. available information we will make available free of charge on or through our website at https://about.underarmour.com/ our annual

affected by numerous risks. you should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this form 10-k. should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted. during a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. many of our products may be considered discretionary items for consumers. factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, unemployment, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. uncertainty in global economic conditions continues, and trends in consumer discretionary spending remain unpredictable. however, consumer purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. a downturn in the economies in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in the united states, china or other key markets, may materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition and our prospects for growth. we derive a substantial portion of our sales from large wholesale customers. if the financial condition of our customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. in 2019, sales through our wholesale channel represented approximately 60% of our net revenues. we extend credit to our wholesale customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. during weak economic conditions, customers may be more cautious with orders or may slow investments necessary to maintain a high quality in-store experience for consumers, which may result in lower sales of our products. in addition, a slowing economy in our key markets or a continued decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers. from time to time certain of our customers have experienced financial difficulties. to the extent one or more of our customers experience significant financial difficulty, bankruptcy, insolvency or cease operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition and results of operations. we may not successfully execute our long-term strategies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. our ability to execute on our long-term strategies depends, in part, on successfully executing on strategic growth initiatives in key areas, such as our international business, footwear and our global direct to consumer sales channel. our growth in these areas depends on our ability to continue to successfully expand our global network of brand and factory house stores, grow our e-commerce and mobile application offerings throughout the world and continue to successfully increase our product offerings and market share in footwear. our ability to invest in these growth initiatives would be negatively impacted if we are unable to grow net revenues in our international business at the rate we expect, or if our north america business, which represented 69% of our total net revenues in 2019, continues to decline or experiences significant market disruption. in addition, our long-term strategy depends on our ability to successfully drive expansion of our gross margins, manage our cost structure and drive return on our investments. if we cannot effectively execute our long-term growth strategies while managing costs effectively, our business could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected results of operations. 9 table of contents we may not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may negatively impact our profitability. in 2017 and 2018 we executed restructuring plans designed to more closely align our financial resources against the critical priorities of our business, and in february 2020, we announced that we are evaluating a potential restructuring plan for 2020. our past plans included initiatives to improve operational efficiencies in targeted areas of our business, and included reductions in our global workforce. we may not achieve the operational improvements and efficiencies that we targeted in our past restructuring plans, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. the 2020 restructuring plan we are evaluating includes the potential decision to forego a flagship store in new york city while pursuing sublet options, in addition to further targeted cost saving measures we are assessing. if we fail to adopt a restructuring plan, our ability to optimize our cost structure will be negatively impacted. in addition, implementing any restructuring plan presents significant potential risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating improvements and/or cost reductions. these risks include, among others, higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring plans, management distraction from ongoing business activities, failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing our restructuring plans, damage to our reputation and brand image and workforce attrition beyond planned reductions. if we fail to achieve targeted operating improvements and/or cost reductions, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted by natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health or political crises or other catastrophic events. we operate retail, distribution and warehousing facilities and offices across the world, and in locations subject to natural disasters or extreme weather conditions, as well as other potential catastrophic events, such as public health emergencies, terrorist attacks or political or military conflict. the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt our operations and negatively impact sales of our products. our customers and suppliers also manage global operations and could experience similar disruption. in addition, an occurrence of these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted region or, depending on the severity, globally, which could negatively impact our results of operations. for example, in december 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan, china, resulting in store closures and a decrease in consumer traffic in china, as well as potential delays in the manufacturing and shipment of products and raw materials to and from china. to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens, we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the production and packaging of our products, factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time, and industry-wide shipment of products may be negatively impacted. we expect the coronavirus to negatively impact our results of operations, particularly our asia-pacific segment, though the extent and duration of this impact remain uncertain and may have a material negative impact on our results of operations. if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences, successfully develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products or engage our consumers, our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted. our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. in addition, long lead times for certain of our products may make it hard for us to quickly respond to changes in consumer demands. our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. our failure to anticipate and respond timely to changing consumer preferences or to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products or design products in the categories and styles that consumers want, demand for our products could decline and our brand image could be negatively impacted. if we experience problems with the quality of our products, our brand reputation may be negatively 10 table of contents impacted and we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems, which could negatively impact our results of operations. consumer shopping preferences and shifts in distribution channels continue to evolve and could negatively impact our results of operations or our future growth. consumer preferences regarding the shopping experience continue to rapidly evolve. we sell our products through a variety of channels, including through wholesale customers and distribution partners, as well as our own direct to consumer business consisting of our brand and factory house stores and e-commerce platforms. if we or our wholesale customers do not provide consumers with an attractive in-store experience, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted. in addition, as part of our strategy to grow our e-commerce revenue, we are investing significantly in enhancing our platform capabilities and implementing systems to drive higher engagement with our consumers. if we do not successfully execute this strategy or continue to provide an engaging and user-friendly digital commerce platform that attracts consumers, our brand image and results of operations could be negatively impacted as well as our opportunities for future growth. a decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and negatively impact our prospects for growth. we generate a significant portion of our wholesale revenues from sales to our largest customers. we currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with our key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these customers and on our position in the marketplace. as a result, we face the risk that these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their relationship with us. the failure to increase our sales to these customers as much as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers' business could result in a material decrease in our net revenues and net income. in addition, our customers continue to experience ongoing industry consolidation, particularly in the sports specialty sector. as this consolidation continues, it increases the risk that if any one customer significantly reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient alternative customers to continue to grow our net revenues, or our net revenues may decline. we must successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business, or our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted. we have expanded our business and operations rapidly since our inception and we must continue to successfully manage the operational difficulties associated with expanding our business to meet increased consumer demand throughout the world. we may experience difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. we must also continually evaluate the need to expand critical functions in our business, including sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, our management information systems and other processes and technology. to support these functions, we must hire, train and manage an increasing number of employees. we may not be successful in undertaking these types of initiatives cost effectively or at all, and could experience serious operating difficulties if we fail to do so. these growth efforts could also increase the strain on our existing resources. if we experience difficulties in supporting the growth of our business, we could experience an erosion of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income. our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products. to ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. in addition, a significant portion of our net revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during the last two quarters of the year, which historically has been our peak season. if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include: an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products; our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products; 11 table of contents product introductions by competitors; unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders or at-once orders placed by retailers; the impact on consumer demand due to unseasonable weather conditions; weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political or labor instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials. inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on gross margin. in addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor relationships. the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period. a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability or cause us not to achieve our expected financial results. sales of performance products may not continue to grow or may decline, which could negatively impact our sales and our ability to grow our business. if consumers are not convinced performance apparel, footwear and accessories are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected. in addition, because performance products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. if industry-wide sales of performance products do not continue to grow or rather decline, our sales could be negatively impacted and we may not achieve our expected financial results. in addition, our ability to continue to grow our business in line with our expectations could be adversely impacted. our results of operations are affected by the performance of our equity investment, over which we do not exercise control. we maintain a minority investment in our japanese licensee, which we account for under the equity method, and are required to recognize our allocable share of its net income or loss in our consolidated financial statements. in addition, our results of operations are impacted by the licensee's performance under the license agreement. our results of operations are affected by the performance of that business, over which we do not exercise control, and in 2019, our net income was negatively impacted by losses realized by that business. we are also required to regularly review our investment for impairment, and an impairment charge may result from the occurrence of adverse events or management decisions that impact the fair value or estimated future cash flows to be generated from our investment. in the fourth quarter of 2019, we impaired our investment and recognized a $39.0 million charge as a result. while the carrying value of our investment has been significantly reduced as a result of this impairment, we may be required to further impair our investment in the future. we operate in highly competitive markets and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our net revenues and gross profit. the market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. because we own a limited number of fabric or process patents, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition. due to the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in products similar to ours and private label offerings of certain retailers, 12 table of contents including some of our retail customers. many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, more experience in global markets and greater economies of scale. in addition, our competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. as a result, these competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by: quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements or consumer preferences; readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities; discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off; devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement, partnerships and product endorsement; adopting aggressive pricing policies; and engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes. in addition, while one of our growth strategies has been to increase floor space for our products in retail stores and generally expand our distribution to other retailers, retailers have limited resources and floor space, and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions in the prices of our products, and if retailers have better sell through or earn greater margins from our competitors' products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our profitability may decline or our growth may be negatively impacted as a result of increasing pressure on pricing. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. these factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers or engage in more promotional activity than we anticipate, which could negatively impact our margins and cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. in addition, our ability to achieve short-term growth targets may be negatively impacted if we are unwilling to engage in promotional activity on a scale similar to that of our competitors and we are unable to simultaneously offset declining promotional activity with increased sales at premium price points. this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in addition, ongoing and sustained promotional activities could negatively impact our brand image. fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results. the fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and cotton. significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold. in addition, certain of our manufacturers are subject to government regulations related to wage rates, and therefore the labor costs to produce our products may fluctuate. the cost of transporting our products for distribution and sale is also subject to fluctuation due in large part to the price of oil. because most of our products are manufactured abroad, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances and an increase in the price of oil can significantly increase costs. manufacturing delays or unexpected transportation delays can also cause us to rely more heavily on airfreight to achieve timely delivery to our customers, which significantly increases freight costs. any of these fluctuations may increase our cost of products and have an adverse effect on our profit margins, results of operations and financial condition. we rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide raw materials for and to produce our products, and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity. 13 table of contents many of the materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources. substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2019, 10 manufacturers produced approximately 52% of our apparel and accessories products, and 6 produced approximately 96% of our footwear products. we have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity. we may experience a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. in addition, our unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. if we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. in addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers on our methods, products and quality control standards. any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term. we have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards. in that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. in addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace. labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business. our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. as a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers or manufacturers create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially resulting in canceled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income. our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may limit our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer. a significant element of our future growth strategy depends on our expansion efforts outside of north america. during the year ended december 31, 2019, 69% of our net revenues were earned in our north america segment. we have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices in certain regions outside of north america, and may face difficulties in expanding to and successfully operating in those markets. international expansion may place increased demands on our operational, managerial and administrative resources and may be more costly than we expect. in addition, in connection with expansion efforts outside of north america, we may face cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices and difficulties in keeping abreast of market, business and technical developments and customers' tastes and preferences. we may also encounter difficulty expanding into new markets because of more limited brand recognition leading to delayed acceptance of our products. failure to successfully grow our business outside north america would negatively impact our ability to achieve our near-term and long-term growth targets. our financial results and ability to grow our business may be negatively impacted by economic, regulatory and political risks beyond our control. substantially all of our manufacturers are located outside of the united states and an increasing amount of our net revenue is generated by sales in our international business. as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including: 14 table of contents political or labor unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are manufactured; currency exchange fluctuations or requirements to transact in specific currencies; the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change; uncertainties and the ongoing effect of the united kingdom's withdraw from the european union; actions of foreign or u.s. governmental authorities impacting trade and foreign investment, particularly during periods of heightened tension between u.s. and foreign governments, including the imposition of new import limitations, duties, anti-dumping penalties, trade restrictions or restrictions on the transfer of funds; reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; disruptions or delays in shipments; and changes in local economic conditions in countries where our stores, customers, manufacturers and suppliers are located. these risks could hamper our ability to sell products in international markets, negatively affect the ability of our manufacturers to produce or deliver our products or procure materials and increase our cost of doing business generally, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. in the event that one or more of these factors make it undesirable or impractical for us to conduct business in a particular country, our business could be adversely affected. if we fail to successfully manage or realize expected results from acquisitions and other significant investments, or if we are required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill, it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. from time to time we may engage in acquisition opportunities we believe are complementary to our business and brand. integrating acquisitions can also require significant efforts and resources, which could divert management attention from more profitable business operations. if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, we may not realize the financial benefits or other synergies we anticipated. in addition, in connection with our acquisitions, we may record goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. we have recognized goodwill impairment charges in the past. if an acquired business does not produce results consistent with financial models used in our analysis of an acquisition, or if reporting units carrying goodwill do not meet our current expectations of future growth rates or market factors outside of our control change significantly, then one or more of our reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. as of december 31, 2019, the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our latin america reporting unit. while no events have occurred that indicated it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired, an impairment may be required in the future if our current expectations for this reporting unit are not met. our credit agreement contains financial covenants, and both our credit agreement and debt securities contain other restrictions on our actions, which could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. we have, from time to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under our credit facility and the issuance of debt securities. our debt securities limit our ability to, subject to certain significant exceptions, incur secured debt and engage in sale leaseback transactions. our credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions limit our ability, among other things to incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. in addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement, and in the past we have amended our credit agreement to increase these ratios in certain quarterly periods. failure to comply with these operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. these covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best interests. failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement or our debt securities could result in a default. in addition, the credit agreement includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under certain other debt obligations (including our debt securities) will be considered an 15 table of contents event of default under the credit agreement. if an event of default occurs, the commitments of the lenders under the credit agreement may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. our debt securities include a cross acceleration provision which provides that the acceleration of certain other debt obligations (including our credit agreement) will be considered an event of default under our debt securities and, subject to certain time and notice periods, give bondholders the right to accelerate our debt securities. we may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. we have utilized cash on hand and cash generated from operations, accessed our credit facility and issued debt securities as sources of liquidity. if cash on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financing, to fund our growth. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of liquidity, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, are dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. our credit ratings have been downgraded previously, and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain our current ratings, which could increase our cost of borrowing in the future. in addition, equity financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of our common stock. the holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. if new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business. in addition, the u.k. financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021. our credit agreement permits us to borrow based on an adjusted libor rate, plus an applicable margin. while the credit agreement provides for a mechanism for determining an alternative interest rate following this phase out, uncertainty regarding alternative rates may make borrowing under our credit agreement or refinancing our other indebtedness more expensive or difficult to achieve on terms we consider favorable. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations, which could adversely affect the price of our publicly traded common stock. we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and income from operations. these variations are primarily related to the mix of our products sold during the fall selling season, including our higher price cold weather products, along with a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. our quarterly results may also vary based on the timing of customer orders. the majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of marketing expenses and changes in our product mix. variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly results of operations. for example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our coldgear line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations. as a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. this could cause the price of our publicly traded stock to fluctuate significantly. our financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations. we generated approximately 28% of our consolidated net revenues outside the united states. as our international business grows, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the united states are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into u.s. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than 16 table of contents their local currencies. in addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. as a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations. the value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are associated with negative publicity. our business could be adversely impacted if negative publicity regarding our brand, our company or our business partners diminishes the appeal of our brand to consumers. for example, while we require our suppliers, manufacturers and licensees of our products to operate their businesses in compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as the social and other standards and policies we impose on them, including our code of conduct, we do not control their practices. a violation, or alleged violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licensees. in addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. actions taken by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. these and other types of negative publicity, especially through social media which potentially accelerates and increases the scope of negative publicity, could negatively impact our brand image and result in diminished loyalty to our brand, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. this could have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations. sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image. a key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and collegiate athletes. we have developed licensing agreements to be the official supplier of performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level and sponsorship agreements with athletes. however, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. as a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected. our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity. the labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies, including the federal trade commission, consumer product safety commission and state attorneys general in the u.s., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in which our products are distributed or sold. if we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims or be required to recall products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and disrupt our ability to conduct our business, as well as damage our brand image with consumers. in addition, the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant unanticipated compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net revenues. our international operations are also subject to compliance with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, or fcpa, and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. although we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, agents and other partners will not take actions in violations of our policies. any such violation could subject us to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results. 17 table of contents if we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected. we rely on a limited number of distribution facilities for our product distribution. our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses or malware, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. in addition, because many of our products are distributed from a limited number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by severe weather conditions, floods, fires or other natural disasters in these locations, as well as labor or other operational difficulties or interruptions. we maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. in addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties. this includes the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities, as well as partnering with third party distribution facilities in certain regions where we do not maintain our own facilities. from time to time, certain of our partners have experienced disruptions to their operations, including cyber-related disruptions. if we or our partners encounter such problems, our results of operations, as well as our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected. we rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business. our business relies on information technology. our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. we also heavily rely on information systems to process financial and accounting information for financial reporting purposes. any of these information systems could fail or experience a service interruption for a number of reasons, including computer viruses or malware, programming errors, hacking or other unlawful activities, disasters or our failure to properly maintain system redundancy or protect, repair, maintain or upgrade our systems. the failure of our information systems to operate effectively or to integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, which could negatively impact our financial results. if we experienced any significant disruption to our financial information systems that we are unable to mitigate, our ability to timely report our financial results could be impacted, which could negatively impact our stock price. we also communicate electronically throughout the world with our employees and with third parties, such as customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. a service interruption or shutdown could have a materially adverse impact on our operating activities. remediation and repair of any failure, problem or breach of our key information systems could require significant capital investments. in addition, we interact with many of our consumers through both our e-commerce website and our mobile applications, and these systems face similar risk of interruption or attack. consumers increasingly utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our connected fitness community. if we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. the performance of our connected fitness business is dependent on reliable performance of its products, applications and services and the underlying technical infrastructure, which incorporate complex software. if this software contains errors, bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users or loss of revenue. data security or privacy breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to incur additional expense, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business and results of operations. we collect sensitive and proprietary business information as well as personally identifiable information in connection with digital marketing, digital commerce, our in-store payment processing systems and our connected fitness business. in particular, in our connected fitness business we collect and store a variety of information regarding our users, and allow users to share their personal information with each other and with third parties. we also rely on third parties for the operation of certain of our e-commerce websites, and do not control these service providers. hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks. any breach of our data security or that of our service providers could result in an unauthorized release or transfer of customer, consumer, vendor, user or employee information, or the loss of valuable business data or 18 table of contents cause a disruption in our business. these events could give rise to unwanted media attention, damage our reputation, damage our customer, consumer or user relationships and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. we may also be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or respond to or alleviate problems caused by a security breach, which could negatively impact our results of operations. for example, in early 2018 an unauthorized third party acquired data associated with our connected fitness users' accounts for our myfitnesspal application and website. approximately 150 million user accounts were affected by this issue, and the affected information included usernames, email addresses and hashed passwords. we continue to face legal proceedings in connection with this incident, and we may face claims or investigations by government regulators and agencies. we may also be required to incur additional expense to further enhance our data security infrastructure. we must also comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards throughout the world enacted to protect personal information and other data. compliance with existing, proposed and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and could negatively impact our profitability. in addition, an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and subject us to litigation or other regulatory proceedings. for example, the european union adopted a new regulation that became effective in may 2018, called the general data protection regulation ( gdpr ), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. failure to meet the gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. the gdpr also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar or stricter measures. for example, in january 2020, the california consumer privacy act took effect, and establishes transparency roles and creates new data privacy rights for consumers. any of these factors could negatively impact our profitability, result in negative publicity and damage our brand image or cause the size of our connected fitness community to decline. we are in the process of implementing a new operating and information system, which involves risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. in 2015, we began the process of implementing a global operating and financial reporting information technology system, sap fashion management solution ("fms"), as part of a multi-year plan to integrate and upgrade our systems and processes. the first phase of this implementation became operational during 2017 in our north america, emea and connected fitness operations. the next phase of this implementation became operational in 2019 in our asia-pacific region, and we are currently in the process of implementing fms in our latin american region, which is expected to become operational in 2020. implementation of new information systems involves risks and uncertainties. any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems could result in increased costs, disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products, delays in the collection of payment from our customers or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability. we are subject to income taxes in the united states (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-u.s. earnings for which we have not previously provided applicable foreign withholding taxes, certain u.s. state income taxes, or foreign exchange rate impacts. for example, the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ) on december 22, 2017, which had a significant impact to our provision for income taxes. the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under u.s. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the tax act, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. the u.s. treasury department, the internal revenue service, and u.s. states taxing authorities could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. 19 table of contents additionally, we engage in multiple types of intercompany transactions, and our allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries through our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements are subject to review by the internal revenue service and foreign tax authorities. although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our tax provision. moreover, the organization for economic co-operation and development and many of the countries in which we do business continue to evaluate changes to tax laws which could significantly impact the allocation of profits and losses among us and our subsidiaries and impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory rates. we regularly assess all these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision, which is subject to significant judgment. our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns. from time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, new businesses, and expansion of existing businesses, such as the ongoing expansion of our network of brand and factory house stores and our distribution facilities, investments to implement our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, or investments to support our digital strategy. these investments require substantial cash investments and management attention. we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability. the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or synergies we expect could adversely affect our financial results. infrastructure investments may also divert funds from other potential business opportunities. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, particularly kevin a. plank, our founder, executive chairman and brand chief and patrik frisk, our chief executive officer and president and other top executives. the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. we also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation, innovation, sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. if we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business objectives. to be successful in continuing to profitably grow our business and manage our operations, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience. competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. if we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business and achieve our long term objectives. a number of our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors. the intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture the majority of our products are generally owned or controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. our ability to obtain patent protection for our products is limited and we currently own a limited number of fabric or process patents. as a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to certain of our products. because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products based on certain of our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. if our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected. 20 table of contents our intellectual property rights and product offerings could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling or providing some of our products. our success depends in large part on our brand image. we believe our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. in addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments, including our digital business. from time to time, we have received or brought claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect such claims will continue or increase, particularly as we expand our business and the number of products we offer. any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend or prosecute. successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling or providing some of our products. in addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. any of these events could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues. we currently rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. in addition, intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. if we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer. from time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party's products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand, result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business. we have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation. we are the subject of a number of ongoing legal proceedings that have resulted in significant expense, and adverse developments in our ongoing proceedings and/or future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. we are currently involved in a variety of litigation, investigations and other legal matters and may be subject to additional investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to commercial disputes, intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. for example, we are subject to an ongoing securities class action proceeding regarding our prior disclosures and derivative complaints regarding related matters, as well as past related party transactions, among other proceedings. refer to note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii, item 8 of this annual report on form 10-k for additional information regarding these specific matters. in addition, as previously disclosed in november 2019, we have been responding to requests for documents and information from the u.s. securities and exchange commission and department of justice regarding certain of our accounting practices and related disclosures. legal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. in addition, we cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, or whether ongoing investigations will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in enforcement actions, charges or material damages, fines or other penalties. an unfavorable outcome may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations or 21 table of contents our stock price. any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our customers or our shareholders. furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our brand image. the trading prices for our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time. the trading prices of our class a and class c common stock may differ and fluctuate from time to time in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. these factors may include, among others, overall performance of the equity markets and the economy as a whole, variations in our quarterly results of operations or those of our competitors, our ability to meet our published guidance and securities analyst expectations, or recommendations by securities analysts. in addition, our non-voting class c common stock has traded at a discount to our class a common stock, and there can be no assurance that this will not continue. kevin plank, our executive chairman and brand chief controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock. our class a common stock has one vote per share, our class b common stock has 10 votes per share and our class c common stock has no voting rights (except in limited circumstances). our executive chairman and brand chief, kevin a. plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of class b common stock. as a result, mr. plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our board of directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. under certain circumstances, the class b common stock automatically converts to class a common stock, which would also result in the conversion of our class c common stock into class a common stock. as specified in our charter, these circumstances include when mr. plank beneficially owns less than 15.0% of the total number of shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding, if mr. plank were to resign as an approved executive officer of the company (or was otherwise terminated for cause) or if mr. plank sells more than a specified number of any class of our common stock within a one-year period. this concentration of voting control may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control or allowing us to take action that the majority of our shareholders do not otherwise support. in addition, we utilize shares of our class c common stock to fund employee equity incentive programs and may do so in connection with future stock-based acquisition transactions, which could prolong the duration of mr. plank's voting control. item 1b. unresolved staff comments not applicable. 22 table of contents item 2. properties the following includes a summary of the principal properties that we own or lease as of december 31, 2019. our principal executive and administrative offices are located at an office complex in baltimore, maryland, the majority of which we own and a portion of which we lease. for each of our european, latin america and asia pacific headquarters, we lease office space. additionally, we lease space in austin, texas and san francisco, california for our connected fitness business. we lease our primary distribution facilities, which are located in sparrows point, maryland, mount juliet, tennessee and rialto, california. combined, these facilities represent approximately 3.5 million square feet of facility space. these leases expire at various dates, with the earliest lease termination date through may 2023. we believe our distribution facilities and space available through our third-party logistics providers will be adequate to meet our short term needs. in addition, as of december 31, 2019, we leased 388 brand and factory house stores located primarily in the united states, china, mexico, korea, chile, and canada with lease end dates in 2019 through 2033. we also lease additional office space for sales, quality assurance and sourcing, marketing, and administrative functions. we anticipate that we will be able to extend these leases that expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to other locations. item 3. legal proceedings from time to time, we have been involved in litigation and other proceedings, including matters related to commercial disputes and intellectual property, as well as trade, regulatory and other claims related to our business. refer to note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for information on

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10-k for fiscal year 2018, filed with the sec on february 22, 2019. overview we are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. the brand's moisture-wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles. the under armour connected fitness strategy is focused on engaging with these consumers and increasing awareness and sales of our products. our net revenues grew to $5,267.1 million in 2019 from $3,963.3 million in 2015. we believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the under armour brand in the marketplace. our long-term growth strategy is focused on increased sales of our products through ongoing product innovation, investment in our distribution channels and international expansion. while we plan to continue to invest in growth, we also plan to improve efficiencies throughout our business as we seek to gain scale through our operations and return on our investments. financial highlights for full year 2019 as compared to the prior year period include: net revenues increased 1%. wholesale revenues increased 1% and direct to consumer revenues were flat. apparel revenue was flat. footwear revenue increased 2% and accessories revenue decreased 1%. revenue in our north america segment declined 2%. revenue in our asia-pacific, emea and latin america segments grew 14%, 5% and 3%, respectively, with 13% growth in our connected fitness segment. gross margin increased 180 basis points. selling, general and administrative expense increased 2%. a large majority of our products are sold in north america; however, we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. internationally, our net revenues are generated primarily from a mix of sales to retailers and distributors in our wholesale channel and sales through our direct to consumer channel in europe, latin america, and asia-pacific. we believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle. we believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. we also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non-performance products to performance products, which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin, helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort. we plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth, we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities or negatively impact our financial results, including, among others, the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers. for example, recent and ongoing developments regarding the coronavirus may negatively impact our results of operations. additionally, we may not be able to successfully execute on our long-term strategies, or successfully manage the increasingly complex operations of our global business effectively. although we have implemented restructuring plans in the past and may implement additional plans in the future, we 30 table of contents may not fully realize the expected benefits of these plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives. in addition, we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner. furthermore, our industry is very competitive, and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability. we also rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers outside the u.s. to provide fabrics and to produce our products, and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business. our results may also be negatively impacted by the performance of our japanese licensee. for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a. segment presentation and marketing effective january 1, 2019, we changed the way we internally analyze the business and now exclude certain corporate costs from our segment profitability measures. we now report these costs within corporate other, which is designed to provide increased transparency and comparability of the performance of our operating segments. prior year amounts have been recast to conform to the 2019 presentation. these changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity, or cash flows. corporate other consists largely of general and administrative expenses not allocated to an operating segment, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments such as global marketing, global it, global supply chain, innovation and other corporate support functions; costs related to our global assets and global marketing, costs related to our headquarters; restructuring and restructuring related charges; and certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses. in connection with the corporate other presentation discussed above, effective january 1, 2019, we changed the way we internally analyze marketing. personnel costs previously included in marketing expense are now included in other expense and digital advertising and placement services previously included in other expense are now included in marketing expense. we believe these changes provide management with increased transparency of our demand creation investments. certain prior year amounts have been recast to conform to the 2019 presentation. these changes did not have a material impact on marketing amounts. 2020 restructuring initiative in february 2020, we announced that we are currently assessing a potential 2020 restructuring initiative to rebalance our cost base to further improve profitability and cash flow generation. in connection with this initiative, we are considering $325 million to $425 million in estimated pre-tax charges for 2020, including approximately $225 million to $250 million related to the possibility of foregoing opening a flagship store in new york city while pursuing sublet options for the long-term lease. we expect to complete our assessment during the first quarter of 2020, and subject to review and approval by our board of directors, would announce any potential restructuring charges upon adoption of a restructuring plan. 2017 and 2018 restructuring plans in both 2017 and 2018, our board of directors approved restructuring plans (the "2017 restructuring plan" and "2018 restructuring plan") designed to more closely align our financial resources with the critical priorities of our business and optimize operations. we recognized approximately $203.9 million of pre-tax charges in connection with our 2018 restructuring plan and approximately $129.1 million of pre-tax charges in connection with our 2017 restructuring plan, inclusive of $28.6 million of restructuring related goodwill impairment charges for our connected fitness business. the summary of the costs incurred during the years ended december 31, 2018 and 2017, in connection with the 2018 and 2017 restructuring plans, respectively, are as follows: 31 table of contents year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 costs recorded in cost of goods sold: inventory write-offs $ 20,800 $ 5,077 total cost recorded in cost of goods sold 20,800 5,077 costs recorded in restructuring and impairment charges: impairment 12,146 71,378 employee related costs 9,949 14,572 contract exit costs 114,126

129,126 there were no restructuring charges incurred during the year ended december 31, 2019. general net revenues comprise net sales, license revenues and connected fitness revenues. net sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. our license revenues primarily consist of fees paid to us from licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on their products. our connected fitness revenues consist of digital advertising and subscriptions from our connected fitness business. cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs, inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for inventory obsolescence. the fabrics in many of our products are made primarily of petroleum-based synthetic materials. therefore our product costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. in general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear. a limited portion of cost of goods sold is associated with license and connected fitness revenues. we include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. as a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. these costs were $81.0 million, $91.8 million and $101.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and corporate services. we consolidate our selling, general and administrative expenses into two primary categories: marketing and other. the other category is the sum of our selling, product innovation and supply chain, and corporate services categories. the marketing category consists primarily of sports and brand marketing, media, and retail presentation. sports and brand marketing includes professional, club, collegiate sponsorship, individual athlete and influencer agreements, and products provided directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. media includes digital, broadcast and print media outlets, including social and mobile media. retail presentation includes sales displays and concept shops and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture programs. our marketing costs are an important driver of our growth. other expense, net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our foreign currency derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries. 32 table of contents results of operations

foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within our geographic operating segments, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program. the increase in net sales was driven primarily by unit sales growth in footwear, resulting from strength in our run category. the increase was partially offset by unit sales decline in accessories driven by softer demand. license revenues increased $14.0 million, or 11.2%, to $138.8 million in 2019 from $124.8 million in 2018, primarily driven by minimum guaranteed royalties and settlements with two of our north america licensing partners. connected fitness revenue increased $16.0 million, or 13.3%, to $136.4 million in 2019 from $120.4 million in 2018 primarily driven by an increase in new subscription revenue and a one-time development fee from a partner. this was partially offset by a decrease in media revenue. gross profit increased $130.0 million to $2,470.5 million in 2019 from $2,340.5 million in 2018. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, increased to 46.9% in 2019 compared to 45.1% in 2018. this increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following: approximate 90 basis point increase driven by supply chain initiatives related to favorable product costs and lower air freight; approximate 50 basis point increase driven by channel mix, primarily due to a lower percentage of off-price sales within our wholesale channel; and approximate 40 basis point increase driven by restructuring related charges in the prior year period. with the exception of improvements in supply chain initiatives related to product cost improvements, we do not expect these trends to have a material impact on the full year 2020. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $51.5 million to $2,233.8 million in 2019 from $2,182.3 million in 2018. as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 42.4% in 2019 from 42.0% in 2018. selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following: marketing costs increased $19.3 million to $579.0 million in 2019 from $559.7 million in 2018. this increase was primarily due to increased marketing investments with the growth of our international business and additional investments in brand marketing campaigns. this was partially offset by lower sports marketing sponsorship expense. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs increased to 11.0% in 2019 from 10.8% in 2018. other costs increased $32.2 million to $1,654.8 million in 2019 from $1,622.6 million in 2018. this increase was primarily due to higher compensation expense, increased process design efficiency consulting expense and increased spend in digital consulting and managed services. as a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 31.4% in 2019 from 31.2% in 2018. restructuring and impairment charges related to the 2018 restructuring plan were $183.1 million for the year ended december 31, 2018. there was no restructuring plan or charges in the year ended december 31, 2019. income (loss) from operations increased $261.8 million, or 1046.4%, to income of $236.8 million in 2019 from a loss of $25.0 million in 2018. as a percentage of net revenues, income from operations increased to income 34 table of contents of 4.5% in 2019 from a loss of 0.4% in 2018. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $203.9 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2018 restructuring plan. interest expense, net decreased $12.4 million to $21.2 million in 2019 from $33.6 million in 2018. this decrease was due to lower interest expense as a result of the prepayment of the outstanding balance of $136.3 million on our term loan and lower borrowings on our revolving credit facility. other expense, net decreased $3.5 million to $5.7 million in 2019 from $9.2 million in 2018. this decrease was due to lower net loss on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies as compared to the prior period, primarily due to increased number of currencies included in our foreign exchange hedging program. income tax expense (benefit) increased $90.6 million to an expense of $70.0 million in 2019 from a benefit of $20.6 million in 2018. our income tax expense (benefit) for 2019, as compared to 2018, was higher primarily due to pre-tax income in 2019 compared to pre-tax losses in 2018, increases in valuation allowances recorded for certain u.s. state jurisdictions, and the one-time benefit in 2018 for an intercompany intangible asset sale. these increases were partially offset by a decrease in valuation allowances recorded for certain foreign jurisdictions in 2019 compared to 2018. income (loss) from equity method investment decreased $48.6 million to a loss of $47.7 million in 2019 from income of $0.9 million in 2018. this decrease was primarily due to a $39.0 million impairment of our equity method investment in our japanese licensee for the year ended december 31, 2019. year ended december 31, 2018 compared to year ended december 31, 2017 net revenues increased $203.9 million, or 4.1%, to $5,193.2 million in 2018 from $4,989.2 million in 2017. net revenues by product

by the train category; and footwear unit sales growth, led by the run category. the increase was partially offset by unit sales decline in accessories. license revenues increased $8.2 million, or 7.0%, to $124.8 million in 2018 from $116.6 million in 2017. connected fitness revenue increased $18.5 million, or 18.1%, to $120.4 million in 2018 from $101.9 million in 2017 primarily driven by increased subscribers on our fitness applications. gross profit increased $89.1 million to $2,340.5 million in 2018 from $2,251.4 million in 2017. gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, was unchanged at 45.1% in 2018 compared to 2017. gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by lower promotional activity, improvements in product cost, lower air freight, higher proportion of international and connected fitness revenue and changes in foreign currency; these favorable impacts were offset by channel mix including higher sales to our off-price channel and restructuring related charges. selling, general and administrative expenses increased $82.8 million to $2,182.3 million in 2018 from $2,099.5 million in 2017. as a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 42.0% in 2018 from 42.1% in 2017. selling, general and administrative expense was impacted by the following: 35 table of contents marketing costs decreased $5.5 million to $559.7 million in 2018 from $565.2 million in 2017. this decrease was primarily due to restructuring efforts, resulting in lower sports marketing sponsorship expense. this decrease was partially offset by higher costs in connection with brand marketing campaigns and increased marketing investments with the growth of our international business. as a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 10.8% in 2018 from 11.3% in 2017. other costs increased $88.3 million to $1,622.6 million in 2018 from $1,534.3 million in 2017. this increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and higher costs incurred for the continued expansion of our direct to consumer distribution channel and international business. as a percentage of net revenues, other costs increased to 31.2% in 2018 from 30.8% in 2017. restructuring and impairment charges increased $59.1 million to $183.1 million from $124.0 million in 2017. refer to the 2017 and 2018 restructuring plans section above for a summary of charges. income (loss) from operations decreased $52.8 million, or 189.9%, to a loss of $25.0 million in 2018 from income of $27.8 million in 2017. as a percentage of net revenues, income from operations decreased to a loss of 0.4% in 2018 from income of 0.5% in 2017. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2018 was negatively impacted by $203.9 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2018 restructuring plan. income from operations for the year ended december 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by $129.1 million of restructuring, impairment and related charges in connection with the 2017 restructuring plan. interest expense, net decreased $0.9 million to $33.6 million in 2018 from $34.5 million in 2017. other expense, net increased $5.6 million to $9.2 million in 2018 from $3.6 million in 2017. this increase was due to higher net loss on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in foreign currencies as compared to the prior period. income tax expense (benefit) decreased $58.6 million to a benefit of $20.6 million in 2018 from an expense of $38.0 million in 2017. our effective tax rate was 30.3% in 2018 compared to (368.2)% in 2017. our effective tax rate for 2018, as compared to 2017, was positively impacted by a one-time tax benefit recorded in 2018 for an intercompany intangible asset sale and the decrease in one-time tax charges due to the tax act. these positive impacts were partially offset by the impact of the decrease in the u.s. federal rate applied to u.s. pre-tax losses in 2018. as of december 31, 2018, we had completed our accounting for the one-time tax effects of the enactment of the tax act. our 2018 provision for income taxes included a $1.5 million charge to income tax expense as a result of completing this accounting. this was comprised of $12.0 million of income tax expense related to the transition tax and $(10.5) million of income tax benefit for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets for the reduction in the u.s. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. 36 table of contents segment results of operations our operating segments are based on how the chief operating decision maker ( codm ) makes decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. our segments are defined by geographic regions, including north america, emea, asia-pacific, and latin america. connected fitness is also an operating segment. we exclude certain corporate costs from our segment profitability measures. we reports these costs within corporate other, which is designed to provide increased transparency and comparability of our operating segments performance. corporate other

following: net revenues in our north america operating segment decreased $76.9 million to $3,658.4 million in 2019 from $3,735.3 million in 2018 primarily due to a unit sales decrease of off-price sales within our wholesale channel and a unit sales decrease in our direct to consumer channel. this was partially offset by favorable impacts of returns activity within our wholesale channel, driven by approximately $33.1 million of specific customer returns that were lower than the reserves previously established. net revenues in our emea operating segment increased $30.1 million to $621.1 million in 2019 from $591.1 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale and direct to consumer channels. net revenues in our asia-pacific operating segment increased $78.9

increased $5.3 million to $196.1 million in 2019 from $190.8 million in 2018 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel, partially offset by a decrease due to a change in our business model in brazil from a subsidiary to a license and distributor model. net revenues in our connected fitness operating segment increased $16.0 million to $136.4 million in 2019 from $120.4 million in

$181.3 million in 2017 primarily due to unit sales growth in our wholesale channel in mexico and chile, partially offset by a decrease in unit sales due a change in our business model in brazil from a subsidiary to a license and distributor model. net revenues in our connected fitness operating segment increased $18.5 million to $120.4 million in 2018 from $101.9 million in 2017 primarily driven by additional subscription revenue on our fitness applications. operating income (loss) by segment is summarized below: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 $ change % change north america $

segments operating income in our north america operating segment increased $18.0 million to $718.2 million in 2018 from $700.2 million in 2017 primarily due to decreased marketing and selling costs. operating income in our emea operating segment increased $4.3 million to $30.4 million in 2018 from $26.0 million in 2017 primarily due to the increase in net sales discussed above, partially offset by a reserve related to a commercial dispute and increased marketing. operating income in our asia-pacific operating segment increased $14.2 million to $103.5 million in 2018 from $89.3 million in 2017 primarily due to sales growth discussed above. this increase was partially offset by higher investments in our direct to consumer business. operating loss in our latin america operating segment increased $2.5 million to $16.9 million in 2018 from $14.4 million in 2017 primarily due to lower gross margin based on a higher percentage of off-price and independent distributor sales within our wholesale channel. operating loss in our connected fitness segment decreased $12.5 million to income of $5.9 million in 2018 from a loss of $6.5 million in 2017 primarily driven by increased sales growth discussed above. non-operating segment operating loss in our corporate other non-operating segment increased $99.4 million to $866.2 million in 2018 from $766.8 million in 2017 primarily due to a $74.8 million increase in the 2018 restructuring plan charges of $203.9 million, compared to the 2017 restructuring plan charges of $129.1 million. seasonality historically, we have recognized a majority of our net revenues and a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the calendar year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products 39 table of contents during the fall selling season, including a larger proportion of higher margin direct to consumer sales. the level of our working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. we generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season. the following table sets forth certain financial information for the periods indicated. the data is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10-k. all recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below: quarter ended (unaudited) (in thousands) 3/31/2018 6/30/2018 9/30/2018 12/31/2018 3/31/2019 6/30/2019 9/30/2019 12/31/2019 net

(475.5) % 41.8 % 14.9 % (4.8) % 58.7 % 31.3 % financial position, capital resources and liquidity our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. we fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, borrowings available under our credit and long term debt facilities and the issuance of debt securities. our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues in the back half of the year. our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our brand and factory house stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems. our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. these systems and processes, including our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. in addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. we believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations, borrowings available to us under our credit agreement and other financing instruments and our ability to access the capital markets are adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, an economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity (refer to the risk factors section included in item 1a). in addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business on terms acceptable to us or at all. at december 31, 2019, $165.4 million, or approximately 21.0%, of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. based on the capital and liquidity needs of our foreign operations, we intend to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside the united states. in addition, our united states operations do not require the 40 table of contents repatriation of these funds to meet our currently projected liquidity needs. should we require additional capital in the united states, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states. the tax act imposed u.s. federal tax on all post-1986 foreign unrepatriated earnings accumulated through december 31, 2017. the portion of these earnings not subject to u.s. federal income tax as part of the one-time transition tax should, in general, not be subject to u.s. federal income tax. we will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings, as well as future earnings from our foreign subsidiaries, to fund international growth and operations. if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would still be required to accrue and pay certain taxes upon repatriation, including foreign withholding taxes and certain u.s. state taxes and record foreign exchange rate impacts. determination of the unrecorded deferred tax liability that would be incurred if such amounts were repatriated is not practicable. cash flows the following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented: year ended december 31, (in thousands) 2019 2018 2017 net cash provided by (used in): operating activities $ 509,031 $ 628,230 $ 237,460 investing activities (147,113) (202,904) (282,987) financing activities (137,070) (189,868) 106,759 effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 5,100 12,467 4,178 net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 229,948 $ 247,925 $ 65,410 operating activities operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. in addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses. cash flows provided by operating activities decreased $119.2 million to $509.0 million in 2019 from $628.2 million in 2018. the decrease was due to decreased net cash inflows from operating assets and liabilities of $360.2 million. the decrease in cash inflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following: a decrease in cash provided by accounts receivable of $232.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018; a decrease in changes in reserves and allowances and customer refund liabilities of $176.9 million in 2019 as compared to 2018; and a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $153.6 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. this was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by changes in prepaid expenses and other assets of $132.2 million and an increase in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $241.0 million year over year. investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased $55.8 million to $147.1 million in 2019 from $202.9 million in 2018, primarily due to lower capital expenditures and the purchase of an additional 10% common stock ownership in dome corporation ("dome"), our japanese licensee in 2018. total capital expenditures were $144.3 million and $154.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. capital expenditures for 2020 are expected to be approximately $165.0 million. financing activities cash used in financing activities decreased $52.8 million to $137.1 million in 2019 from $189.9 million in 2018. this decrease was primarily due to lower borrowings and net repayments on our credit facility in 2019 compared to 2018. 41 table of contents credit facility on march 8, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement, amending and restating our prior credit agreement. as amended and restated, our credit agreement has a term of five years, maturing in march 2024, and provides revolving credit commitments for up to $1.25 billion of borrowings, with no term loan borrowings, which were provided for under our prior credit agreement. as of december 31, 2019, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $136.3 million outstanding under our prior term loan. at our request and the lender's consent, revolving and or term loan borrowings may be increased by up to $300.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain conditions as set forth in the credit agreement, as amended. incremental borrowings are uncommitted and the availability thereof will depend on market conditions at the time we seek to incur such borrowings. the borrowings under the revolving credit facility have maturities of less than one year. up to $50.0 million of the facility may be used for the issuance of letters of credit. there were $5.0 million of letters of credit outstanding as of december 31, 2019. the credit agreement contains negative covenants that, subject to significant exceptions, limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge our assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. we are also required to maintain a ratio of consolidated ebitda, as defined in the credit agreement, to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.50 to 1.00 and we are not permitted to allow the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda to be greater than 3.25 to 1.00 ("consolidated leverage ratio"). as of december 31, 2019, we were in compliance with these ratios. in addition, the credit agreement contains events of default that are customary for a facility of this nature, and includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other material indebtedness, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under the credit agreement. borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) an alternate base rate, or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made ( adjusted libor ), plus in each case an applicable margin. the applicable margin for loans will be adjusted by reference to a grid (the pricing grid ) based on the consolidated leverage ratio and ranges between 1.00% to 1.25% for adjusted libor loans and 0.00% to 0.25% for alternate base rate loans. the weighted average interest rate under the outstanding term loans was 3.2% during the year ended december 31, 2018. during the year ended december 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under the outstanding term loan. the weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit facility borrowings was 3.6% and 3.0% during the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. we pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility and certain fees with respect to letters of credit. as of december 31, 2019, the commitment fee was 15 basis points. since inception, we incurred and deferred $3.4 million in financing costs in connection with the credit agreement. 3.250% senior notes in june 2016, we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.250% senior unsecured notes due june 15, 2026 (the notes ). the proceeds were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. interest is payable semi-annually on june 15 and december 15 beginning december 15, 2016. prior to march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or a make-whole amount applicable to such notes as described in the indenture governing the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. on or after march 15, 2026 (three months prior to the maturity date of the notes), we may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. the indenture governing the notes contains covenants, including limitations that restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to create or incur secured indebtedness and enter into sale and leaseback transactions and our ability to consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our properties or assets to another person, in each case subject to material exceptions described in the indenture. we incurred and deferred $5.3 million in financing costs in connection with the notes. 42 table of contents other long term debt in december 2012, we entered into a $50.0 million recourse loan collateralized by the land, buildings and tenant improvements comprising our corporate headquarters. in july 2018, this loan was repaid in full, without penalties, using borrowings under our revolving credit facility. interest expense, net was $21.2 million, $33.6 million, and $34.5 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. interest expense includes the amortization of deferred financing costs, bank fees, capital and built-to-suit lease interest and interest expense under the credit and other long term debt facilities. amortization of deferred financing costs was $2.4 million, $1.5 million, and $1.3 million for the years ended december 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. we monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the credit and other long term debt facilities, however during any period of significant instability in the credit markets lenders could be negatively impacted in their ability to perform under these facilities. contractual commitments and contingencies we lease warehouse space, office facilities, space for our brand and factory house stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating leases. the leases expire at various dates through 2035, excluding extensions at our option, and include provisions for rental adjustments. in addition, this table includes executed lease agreements for brand and factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of december 31, 2019. the operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time. our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31, 2019 as well as significant agreements entered into during the period after december 31, 2019 through the date of this report are summarized in the following table: payments due by period (in thousands) total less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years more than 5 years contractual obligations long term debt obligations (1) $ 726,750 $ 19,500 $ 39,000 $ 39,000 $ 629,250 operating lease obligations (2) 1,341,292

1,130 3,293 6,442 total $ 3,845,650 $ 1,395,648 $ 584,367 $ 493,281 $ 1,372,354 (1) includes estimated interest payments based on applicable fixed and currently effective floating interest rates as of december 31, 2019, timing of scheduled payments, and the term of the debt obligations. (2) includes the minimum payments for lease obligations. the lease obligations do not include any contingent rent expense we may incur at our brand and factory house stores based on future sales above a specified minimum or payments made for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes. contingent rent expense was $12.9 million for the year ended december 31, 2019. in february 2020, we announced that we are considering foregoing opening a flagship store in new york city while pursuing sublet options for the long-term lease. the amounts included above reflect our existing contractual obligations with respect to that lease, which totaled $506.2 million as of december 31, 2019. (3) we generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales. the amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders with our manufacturers for our apparel, footwear and accessories, including expected inbound freight, duties and other costs. these open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable prices. the product purchase obligations also includes fabric commitments with our suppliers, which secure a portion of our material needs for future seasons. the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of december 31, 2019. (4) includes sponsorships with professional teams, professional leagues, colleges and universities, individual athletes, athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our brand. some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations. it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. the amount of product 43 table of contents provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. in addition, it is not possible to determine the performance incentive amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based and other variables. the amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these sponsorship agreements. additionally, these amounts include minimum guaranteed royalty payments to endorsers and licensors based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products. (5) represents the future cash payments due related to the tax act enacted in 2017 as part of the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. the table above excludes a liability of $37.2 million for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions. off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad faith. based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations. critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. to prepare these financial statements, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. we believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results. our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements. we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management in its application. our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. it is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended december 31, 2019. the following description of our critical accounting policies largely summarize generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and are meant to provide clarity regarding our existing application of these policies. revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to accounting standards codification 606 ("asc 606"). net revenues consist of net sales of apparel, footwear and accessories, license and connected fitness revenue. we recognize revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring control of promised products or services to our customers, which occurs either at a point in time or over time, depending on when the customer obtains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the products or services. the amount of revenue recognized considers terms of sale that create variability in the amount of consideration that we ultimately expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services and is subject to an overall constraint that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods. sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis within the consolidated statements of operations, and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold. revenue transactions associated with the sale of apparel, footwear, and accessories, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. we satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. in our wholesale channel, transfer of control is based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the 44 table of contents country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. we may also ship product directly from our supplier to wholesale customers and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. in our direct to consumer channel, transfer of control takes place at the point of sale for brand and factory house customers and upon shipment to substantially all e-commerce customers. payment terms for wholesale transactions are established in accordance with local and industry practices. payment is generally required within 30 to 60 days of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer in the united states, and generally within 60 to 90 days of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer internationally. payment is generally due at the time of sale for direct to consumer transactions. gift cards issued to customers by us are recorded as contract liabilities until they are redeemed, at which point revenue is recognized. we also estimate and recognize revenue for gift card balances not expected to ever be redeemed ("breakage") to the extent that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of such unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. such estimates are based upon historical redemption trends, with breakage income recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual customer redemptions. revenue from our licensing arrangements is recognized over time during the period that licensees are provided access to our trademarks and benefit from such access through their sales of licensed products. these arrangements require licensees to pay a sales-based royalty, which for most arrangements may be subject to a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount. payments are generally due quarterly. we recognize revenue for sales-based royalty arrangements (including those for which the royalty exceeds any contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount) as licensed products are sold by the licensee. if a sales-based royalty is not ultimately expected to exceed a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty amount, the minimum is recognized as revenue over the contractual period. this sales-based output measure of progress and pattern of recognition best represents the value transferred to the licensee over the term of the arrangement, as well as the amount of consideration that we are entitled to receive in exchange for providing access to our trademarks. revenue from connected fitness subscriptions is recognized on a gross basis and is recognized over the term of the subscription. we receive payments in advance of revenue recognition for subscriptions and these payments are recorded as contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. related commission cost is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. revenue from connected fitness digital advertising is recognized as we satisfy performance obligations pursuant to customer insertion orders. we record reductions to revenue at the time of the transaction for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. we base these estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. the actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which are inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates. if we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination. provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers. reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are included within customer refund liability and the value of inventory associated with reserves for sales returns are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $219.4 million and $301.4 million, respectively, in reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts within customer refund liability and $61.1 million and $113.9 million, respectively, as the estimated value of inventory associated with the reserves for sales returns within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of revenue recognition. allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. in determining the amount of the reserve, we consider historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgment about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates. if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. in the event we determine a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the 45 table of contents period in which such a determination was made. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $15.1 million and $22.2 million, respectively. inventory valuation and reserves inventories consist primarily of finished goods. costs of finished goods inventories include all costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including inbound freight, duties and other costs. we value our inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost determination. net realizable value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. if we determine that the estimated net realizable value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, we record a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or net realizable value. if actual market conditions are less favorable than those that we projected, further adjustments may be required that would increase the cost of goods sold in the period in which such a determination was made. goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and are allocated to the reporting units that are expected to receive the related benefits. goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized and are required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. in conducting an annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. if factors indicate that is the case, we perform the goodwill impairment test. we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. we estimate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, under the income approach, which indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future. our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit's business, and working capital effects. if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is impaired to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year. as of our annual impairment test, in the fourth quarter of 2019, no impairment of goodwill was identified. the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our latin america reporting unit. the fair value of the latin america reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 19%. holding all other assumptions used in the fair value measurement of the latin america reporting unit constant, a reduction in the growth rate of revenue by 2.25 percentage points or a reduction in the growth rate of net income by 3.5 percentage points would eliminate the headroom. no events occurred during the period ended december 31, 2019 that indicated it was more likely than not that goodwill was impaired. refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of goodwill. we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows. when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. if future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. equity method investment in april 2018, we invested 4.2 billion or $39.2 million in exchange for an additional 10% common stock ownership in dome corporation ("dome"), our japanese licensee. this additional investment brought our total investment in dome's common stock to 29.5%, from 19.5%. we account for our investment in dome under the equity method, given that we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over dome. investments under the equity method are required to be considered for impairment when events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. if a qualitative assessment indicates that our investment in dome may be impaired, a quantitative assessment is performed. if the quantitative assessment indicates a decline in value that is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge would be recognized. in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended december 31, 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of potential impairment indicators for our investment in dome and determined that indicators of impairment exist. while there was no single event or factor, we considered dome's future rate of 46 table of contents growth and profitability and strategic objectives. we performed a valuation of our investment in dome and determined that the fair value of our investment is less than its carrying value by $39.0 million. we determined this decline in value to be other-than-temporary considering the extent to which the market value of our investment is less than the carrying value, the amount of dome's indebtedness maturing within a short-term period, and dome's long-term financial forecast. as a result, we recorded a $39.0 million impairment of our equity method investment in dome in the fourth quarter of 2019, for the year ended december 31, 2019. the impairment charge was recorded within income (loss) from equity method investment on the consolidated statements of operations and as a reduction to the invested balance within other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. we calculate fair value using the discounted cash flows model, which indicates the fair value of the investment based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the investment to generate in the future. for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded the allocable share of dome's net loss of $8.7 million and net income of $1.0 million, respectively, within income (loss) from equity method investment on the consolidated statements of operations and as an adjustment to the invested balance within other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of our total investment in dome was $5.1 million and $52.8 million, respectively. in addition to the investment in dome, we have a license agreement with dome. we recorded license revenues from dome of $37.8 million and $35.6 million for the years ended december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. as of december 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, we have $15.6 million and $13.1 million in licensing receivables outstanding, recorded in the prepaid expenses and other current assets line item within our consolidated balance sheet. to the extent dome continues to experience challenges in the performance of their business, we may not continue to realize the licensing revenues received from them in line with their past results. income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary. we made the policy election to record any liability associated with global intangible low taxed income ( gilti ) in the period in which it was incurred. assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made. a significant portion of our deferred tax assets relate to u.s. federal and state taxing jurisdictions. realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future u.s. pre-tax earnings. in evaluating the recoverability of these deferred tax assets at december 31, 2019, we considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, including but not limited to the following: positive 2019 pre-tax income plus tax permanent differences and taxable income in the u.s. federal and certain state jurisdictions; three year cumulative pre-tax income plus tax permanent differences in the u.s. federal jurisdiction; forecasted future pre-tax income plus tax permanent differences in the u.s. federal and certain state jurisdictions; no history of u.s. federal and state tax attributes expiring unused; restructuring plans undertaken in 2017, 2018, and being assessed for 2020, which aim to improve future profitability; available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies may exist; reversal of deferred tax liabilities and timing thereof. negative three year cumulative pre-tax losses plus tax permanent differences in certain state jurisdictions; forecasted year over year u.s. revenue declines in 2020 which decrease profitability in the u.s. federal and certain state jurisdictions; 47 table of contents restructuring plans undertaken in 2017, 2018, and being assessed for 2020, which result in significant one-time charges, which reduce profitability in the u.s. federal and certain state jurisdictions; inherent challenges in forecasting future pre-tax earnings which rely, in part, on improved profitability from our restructuring efforts; the continued challenges in the u.s. consumer retail business environment. as of december 31, 2019, we believe that the weight of the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence regarding the realization of our u.s. federal deferred tax assets. however, as of december 31, 2019, we believe the weight of the negative evidence outweighs the positive evidence regarding the realization of the majority of the state deferred tax assets and have recorded a valuation allowance against these assets. we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis. income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations. stock-based compensation we account for stock-based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements. as of december 31, 2019, we had $90.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.43 years. this unrecognized compensation expense does not include any expense related to performance-based restricted stock units and stock options for which the performance targets have not been deemed probable as of december 31, 2019. the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards represent management's best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. in addition, compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance targets is deemed probable, which requires management judgment. refer to note 2 and note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock-based compensation. recently issued accounting standards refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10-k for our assessment of recently issued accounting standards. 48 table of contents item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency and interest rate risk we are exposed to global market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency and interest rates. we use derivative instruments to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business and do not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. we may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under u.s. gaap. we formally document all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedged transactions. this process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to forecasted cash flows and assessing, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the hedging relationships. our foreign exchange risk management program consists of designated cash flow hedges and undesignated hedges. as of december 31, 2019, we had hedge instruments, primarily for british pound/ u.s. dollar, u.s. dollar/chinese renminbi, u.s. dollar/canadian dollar, euro/u.s. dollar, u.s. dollar/mexican peso, and u.s. dollar/japanese yen currency pairs. all derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value and classified based on the instruments maturity dates. the table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange agreements and presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by contractual maturity dates: fair value as of year ended (in thousands) 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and thereafter total december 31, 2019 december 31, 2018 on-balance sheet financial instruments usd functional currency eur notional

average exchange rate 20.18 20.79 20.29 we currently generate a majority of our consolidated net revenues in the united states, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the u.s. dollar. as our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the united states increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, as we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies and if the u.s. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the u.s. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. in addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. these gains and losses are driven by non-functional currency generated revenue, non-functional currency inventory purchases, investments in u.s. dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities, and certain other intercompany transactions. as of december 31, 2019, the 49 table of contents aggregate notional value of our outstanding cash flow hedges was $879.8 million, with contract maturities ranging from one to twenty-four months. in order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, we may enter into long term debt arrangements with various lenders which bear a range of fixed and variable rates of interest. the nature and amount of our long term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. we may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations from time to time. however, as of december 31, 2019, our exposure to interest rate fluctuations was not material to our financial condition or results of operations, as substantially all of our debt is fixed-rate indebtedness and we do not have a material investment portfolio. our interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. as of december 31, 2019, we had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts. for contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value are reported as other comprehensive income and are recognized in current earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects current earnings. one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions. by their very nature, our estimates of the anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income (loss) to other expense, net during the period in which the decrease occurs. we enter into derivative contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the derivative contracts. however, we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. although we have entered into foreign currency contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by our customer base. we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks as of december 31, 2019. refer to "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - critical accounting policies and estimates - allowance for doubtful accounts" for further discussion on our policies. inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations in recent periods, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs. 50 table of contents
