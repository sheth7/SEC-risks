( clark ) on april 30, 2019. the company allocated the purchase price to the identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their respective fair values. we identified the company's determination of the fair value of the identified intangible assets acquired in the clark acquisition as a critical audit matter. the principal considerations for our determination that the fair value of identified intangible assets in the acquisition of clark is a critical audit matter are because of the significant estimates management makes to determine their fair value. this requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our valuation specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's assumptions related to the discount rates, customer attrition, and revenue growth projections. our audit procedures related to the determination of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in the clark acquisition included the following, among others. we tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the accounting for the clark acquisition, which included the models used to determine the fair value of major classes of intangible assets along with any contingent consideration liabilities. we inspected the purchase agreement for this acquisition. we utilized valuation specialists to assess the reasonableness of the significant assumptions utilized by management within the models. we recalculated the calculation and support for the opening entry and subsequent recording of the entry for the clark acquisition. 25 accrued insurance as described further in note 1 to the financial statements, rollins, inc. (the company ) retains, up to certain policy-specified limits, certain risks related to general liability, workers' compensation, and vehicle and equipment liability costs. the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the retained loss program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur, whether reported or unreported (although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods) and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims. we identified accrued insurance reserves and related expenses ( accrued insurance ) as a critical audit matter. the principal considerations for our determination that accrued insurance is a critical audit matter are that the accrual for accrued insurance has higher risk of estimation uncertainty due to the loss development factors and inherent assumptions in actuarial methods used in determining the required reserves. the estimation uncertainty and complexity of the actuarial methods utilized resulted in auditor judgment when assessing if management's accrual for accrued insurance was determined utilizing a reasonable basis and was materially correct. our audit procedures related to the accrued insurance reserves included the following, among others: we utilized a specialist in evaluating management's methods and assumptions to ensure the methods provided a reasonable basis for determining reserves including selected loss development factors. we performed a retrospective review of prior projections to current projections to validate that changes in estimated ultimate losses were reasonable. we reconciled claims data to the actuarial information and tested a sample of underlying claims through review of accident reports, insurance claims and legal records to validate information utilized by management in developing the accrual for accrued insurance was complete and accurate. we tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating to accrued insurance, including, but not limited to, controls to (1) validate that claims were reported and submitted accurately and timely, and (2) internal claims data were reconciled to claims data maintained by the third party administrator and submitted to the company's actuary to validate information utilized by management in developing the accrual for accrued insurance was complete and accurate. implementation of asc 842 as more fully described in note 1 to the financial statements, the company adopted asc 842, leases, as of january 1, 2019 which resulted in the recognition of a right-of-use asset ( rou asset ) and a lease liability for operating leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease), at the commencement of the lease term. the liability is equal to the present value of future lease payments. the asset will be based on the liability, subject to certain adjustments, including initial direct costs and lessor provided incentives. we identified adoption of asc 842 as a critical audit matter driven primarily by the significant judgment in establishing the lease liability and rou asset specifically the discount rate to apply to the future lease payments. we identified the adoption of asc 842 as a critical audit matter because it is a substantial change in accounting for leases and as such requires significant auditor judgment in obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence related to management's determination of the lease liability and rou asset and their selection of a discount rate to be applied to future lease payments. our audit procedures related to the adoption of asc 842 include the following, among others. we tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the initial adoption of asc 842 and ongoing accounting for new leases obtained during the period. we evaluated the independent auditor's report on operating effectiveness of controls at the company's third party lease software vendor, which included testing the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant user controls due to the company's reliance on the third party software to appropriately calculate the related rou asset and lease liability. we verified the completeness of the population of leases that management evaluated as part of the initial impact of adoption and the on-going accounting. we inspected a sample of lease contracts, validated the relevant inputs to the lease software, and recalculated the software's calculation of the rou asset and lease liability. we performed procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of the discount rate used by the company in establishing the rou asset and lease liability, which included the use of a specialist to evaluate the reasonableness of the discount rate used by management in the initial measurement of the lease liability. /s/ grant thornton llp we have served as the company's auditor since 2004. atlanta, georgia february 28, 2020
