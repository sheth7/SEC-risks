risk factors 38 "risk factors." copper copper is an internationally traded commodity, and its prices are determined by the major metals exchanges the london metal exchange (lme), new york mercantile exchange (nymex) and shanghai futures exchange. prices on these exchanges generally reflect the worldwide balance of copper supply and demand, and can be volatile and cyclical. during 2016 , the lme spot copper price averaged $2.21 per pound, ranging from a low of $1.96 per pound to a high of $2.69 per pound, and was $2.50 per pound at december 31, 2016 . in general, demand for copper reflects the rate of underlying world economic growth, particularly in industrial production and construction. according to wood mackenzie, a widely followed independent metals market consultant, copper's end-use markets (and their estimated shares of total consumption) are construction (31 percent), consumer products (24 percent), electrical applications (24 percent), transportation (11 percent) and industrial machinery (10 percent). gold gold is used for jewelry, coinage and bullion as well as various industrial and electronic applications. gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world. benchmark prices are generally based on london bullion market association (london) pm quotations. during 2016 , the london pm gold price averaged $1,250 per ounce, ranging from a low of $1,077 per ounce to a high of $1,366 per ounce, and was $1,159 per ounce at december 31, 2016 . molybdenum molybdenum is a key alloying element in steel and the raw material for several chemical-grade products used in catalysts, lubrication, smoke suppression, corrosion inhibition and pigmentation. molybdenum, as a high-purity metal, is also used in electronics such as flat-panel displays and in super alloys used in aerospace. reference prices for molybdenum are available in several publications, including metals week, cru report and metal bulletin . during 2016 , the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged $6.47 per pound, ranging from a low of $5.15 per pound to a high of $8.47 per pound, and was $6.74 per pound at december 31, 2016 . products and sales fcx's consolidated revenues for 2016 primarily included sales of copper ( 70 percent ), gold ( 10 percent ), oil ( 9 percent ) and molybdenum ( 4 percent ). oil and gas sales to phillips 66 company represented 12 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2014 ; no other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in any of the past three years. refer to note 16 for a summary of our consolidated revenues and operating income (loss) by business segment and geographic area. copper products we are one of the world's leading producers of copper concentrate, cathode and continuous cast copper rod. during 2016 , 58 percent of our mined copper was sold in concentrate, 21 percent as cathode and 21 percent as rod from north america operations. the copper ore from our mines is generally processed either by smelting and refining or by solution extraction and electrowinning (sx/ew). before being subject to the smelting and refining process, ore is crushed and treated to produce a copper concentrate with copper content of approximately 20 to 30 percent. copper concentrate is then smelted ( i.e. , subjected to extreme heat) to produce copper anode, which weighs between 800 and 900 pounds and has an average copper content of 99.5 percent. the anode is further treated by electrolytic refining to produce copper cathode, which weighs between 100 and 350 pounds and has an average copper content of 99.99 percent. for ore subject to the sx/ew process, copper is extracted from the ore by dissolving it with a weak sulphuric acid solution. the copper content of the solution is increased in two additional solution-extraction stages, and then the copper-bearing solution undergoes an electrowinning process to produce cathode that is, on average, 99.99 percent copper. our copper cathode is used as the raw material input for copper rod, brass mill products and for other uses. 4 table of contents copper concentrate . we produce copper concentrate at six of our mines. in north america, copper concentrate is produced at the morenci, bagdad, sierrita and chino mines, and a significant portion is shipped to our miami smelter in arizona. copper concentrate is also produced at the cerro verde mine in peru and the grasberg minerals district in indonesia. copper cathode . we produce copper cathode at our electrolytic refinery located in el paso, texas, and at nine of our mines. sx/ew cathode is produced from the morenci, bagdad, safford, sierrita, miami, chino and tyrone mines in north america, and from the cerro verde and el abra mines in south america . copper cathode is also produced at atlantic copper (our wholly owned copper smelting and refining unit in spain) and pt smelting (pt-fi's 25-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery in indonesia). refer to "mining operations - smelting facilities and other mining properties" for further discussion of atlantic copper and pt smelting. continuous cast copper rod . we manufacture continuous cast copper rod at our facilities in el paso, texas; norwich, connecticut; and miami, arizona, primarily using copper cathode produced at our north america copper mines. copper sales north america . the majority of the copper produced at our north america copper mines and refined in our el paso, texas, refinery is consumed at our rod plants. the remainder of our north america copper production is sold in the form of copper cathode or copper concentrate under u.s. dollar-denominated annual contracts. cathode and rod contract prices are generally based on the prevailing commodity exchange inc. (comex - a division of nymex) monthly average spot price for the month of shipment and include a premium. generally, copper rod is sold to wire and cable manufacturers, while cathode is sold to rod, brass or tube fabricators. during 2016 , 12 percent of our north america mines' copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper. south america . production from our south america mines is sold as copper concentrate or copper cathode under u.s. dollar-denominated, annual and multi-year contracts. during 2016 , our south america mines sold approximately 75 percent of their copper production in concentrate and 25 percent as cathode. during 2016, four percent of our south america mines' copper concentrate sales volumes were shipped to atlantic copper. substantially all of south america's copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices. revenues from south america's concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties and treatment charges ( i.e., fees paid to smelters that are generally negotiated annually). in addition, because a portion of the metals contained in copper concentrate is unrecoverable from the smelting process, revenues from south america's concentrate sales are also recorded net of allowances for unrecoverable metals, which are a negotiated term of the contracts and vary by customer. indonesia . pt-fi sells its production in the form of copper concentrate, which contains significant quantities of gold and silver, under u.s. dollar-denominated, long-term contracts. pt-fi also sells a small amount of copper concentrate in the spot market. following is a summary of pt-fi's aggregate percentage concentrate sales to third parties, pt smelting and atlantic copper for the years ended december 31: 2016 2015 2014 third parties 56 % 61 % 36 % pt smelting 42 37 58 atlantic copper 2 2 6 100 % 100 % 100 % substantially all of pt-fi's concentrate sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) primarily based on quoted lme monthly average spot copper prices. revenues from pt-fi's concentrate sales are recorded net of royalties, export duties, treatment charges and allowances for unrecoverable metals. gold products and sales we produce gold mostly from the grasberg minerals district. gold is primarily sold as a component of our copper concentrate or in slimes, which are a product of the smelting and refining process at atlantic copper. gold generally is priced at the average london price for a specified month near the month of shipment. revenues from gold sold 5 table of contents as a component of our copper concentrate are recorded net of treatment and refining charges. revenues from gold sold in slimes are recorded net of refining charges. molybdenum products and sales we are the world's largest producer of molybdenum and molybdenum-based chemicals. in addition to production from the henderson and climax molybdenum mines, we produce molybdenum concentrate at certain of the north america copper mines and the cerro verde copper mine in peru. the majority of our molybdenum concentrate is processed in our own conversion facilities. during 2016 , our molybdenum sales were generally priced based on the average published metals week price for the month prior to the month of shipment. we have incorporated changes in the commercial pricing structure for our molybdenum-based chemical products to enable continuation of chemical-grade production. labor matters at december 31, 2016 , we employed approximately 30,000 people (12,200 in indonesia, 11,000 in north america, 5,400 in south america and 1,400 in europe and other locations). we also had contractors that employ personnel at many of our operations, including approximately 21,300 at the grasberg minerals district in indonesia, 3,700 at our south america mining operations, 3,700 in north america and 400 in europe and other locations. employees represented by unions at december 31, 2016 , are listed below, with the number of employees represented and the expiration date of the applicable union agreements: location number of unions number of union- represented employees expiration date pt-fi indonesia 2 9,456 september 2017 cerro verde peru 1 3,023 august 2018 el abra chile 2 583 april 2020 atlantic copper spain 2 422 december 2015 a kokkola - finland 3 409 november 2017 rotterdam the netherlands 1 61 september 2018 stowmarket united kingdom 1 39 may 2017 a. the collective labor agreement between atlantic copper and its workers' unions expired in december 2015, but has been extended through december 2017 by mutual agreement from both parties in accordance with spanish law. refer to item 1a.

million pounds of molybdenum in 2015 , and 500 million pounds of copper and 11 million pounds of molybdenum in 2014 . cerro verde is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging 1.5 inches per year and is in an active seismic zone. the highest bench elevation is 2,750 meters above sea level, and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1,570 meters above sea level. the peruvian general mining law and cerro verde's mining stability agreement grant the surface rights of mining concessions located on government land. additional government land if obtained prior to 1997, must be leased or purchased. cerro verde has a mining concession covering approximately 157,000 acres, including 14,500 acres rented from the regional government of arequipa, plus 71 acres of owned property, and 80 acres of rights-of-way outside the mining concession area. cerro verde receives electrical power under long-term contracts with kallpa generaci n sa, electroperu and engie energia peru s.a. water for our cerro verde processing operations comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. in 2015, cerro verde completed the construction of a wastewater treatment plant that intercepts raw sewage that would otherwise be discharged into the rio chili and processes it for both use at the cerro verde mine and for recharge of treated water into the rio chili. we believe the cerro verde operation has sufficient water resources to support current operations. for further discussion of risks associated with the availability of water, see item 1a. risk factors. el abra we own a 51 percent interest in el abra, and the remaining 49 percent interest is held by the state-owned copper enterprise corporaci n nacional del cobre de chile (codelco). el abra is an open-pit copper mining complex that has been in operation since 1996 and is located 47 miles north of calama in chile's el loa province, region ii. the site is accessible by paved highway and by rail. the el abra mine is a porphyry copper deposit that has sulfide and oxide mineralization. the predominant primary sulfide copper minerals are bornite and chalcopyrite. there is a minor amount of secondary sulfide mineralization as chalcocite. the oxide copper minerals are chrysocolla and pseudomalachite. there are lesser amounts of copper-bearing clays and tenorite. the el abra operation consists of an open-pit copper mine and a sx/ew facility with a capacity of 500 million pounds of copper cathode per year from a 125,000 metric ton-per-day crushed leach circuit and a similar-sized rom leaching operation. the available fleet consists of thirty-six 220-metric ton haul trucks loaded by four shovels with buckets ranging in size from 34 to 63 cubic meters, which are capable of moving an average of 214,000 metric tons of material per day. 15 table of contents in response to market conditions, in the second half of 2015, we adjusted operations at el abra to reduce mining and stacking rates by approximately 50 percent to achieve lower operating and labor costs, defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the existing operations. el abra's copper production totaled 220 million pounds in 2016 , 324 million pounds in 2015 and 367 million pounds in 2014 . we continue to evaluate a potential large-scale milling operation at el abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. exploration results in recent years at el abra indicate a significant sulfide resource, which could potentially support a major mill project. future investments will be dependent on technical studies, economic factors and market conditions. el abra is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. the highest bench elevation is 4,180 meters above sea level, and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 3,430 meters above sea level. el abra controls a total of approximately 151,300 acres of mining claims covering the ore deposit, stockpiles, process plant, and water wellfield and pipeline. in addition, el abra has land surface rights for the road between the processing plant and the mine, the water wellfield, power transmission lines and for the water pipeline from the salar de ascot n aquifer. el abra currently receives electrical power under a long-term contract with engie energia chile s.a. water for our el abra processing operations comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascot n aquifer pursuant to regulatory approval. we believe el abra has sufficient water rights and regulatory approvals to support current operations. for a discussion of risks associated with the availability of water, refer to item 1a. risk factors. indonesia ownership . pt-fi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia. we directly own 81.28 percent of the outstanding common stock of pt-fi and indirectly own 9.36 percent through our wholly owned subsidiary, pt indocopper investama; the indonesian government owns the remaining 9.36 percent. pt-fi has an unincorporated joint venture with rio tinto, under which rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver through 2022 in block a of pt-fi's contract of work (cow), and after 2022, a 40 percent interest in all production from block a. the block a area is where all of pt-fi's proven and probable mineral reserves and all of its current mining operations are located. refer to note 3 for further discussion of the joint venture agreement. 16 table of contents contract of work . pt-fi conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia through a cow with the indonesian government. the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties, repatriation and other matters, and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law, which expresses indonesia's foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors. specifically, the cow provides that the indonesian government will not nationalize or expropriate pt-fi's mining operations. any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration. pt-fi's original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by the current cow in 1991. the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021, but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. the cow allows us to conduct exploration, mining and production activities in the 24,700-acre block a area. under the cow, pt-fi also conducts exploration activities in the block b area currently covering 502,000 acres. under the cow, pt-fi pays royalties on copper, gold and silver in the concentrate it sells (refer to note 13 for further discussion of the royalty rates). a large part of the mineral royalties under indonesian government regulations is designated to the provinces from which the minerals are extracted. in connection with its fourth concentrator mill expansion completed in 1998, pt-fi agreed to pay the indonesian government additional royalties, which were not required by the cow, to provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua. pt-fi's royalties totaled $131 million in 2016 , $114 million in 2015 and $115 million in 2014 . regulatory matters . pt-fi continues to seek approval from indonesian authorities for the export of its copper concentrate, consistent with its rights under the cow. in january 2014, the indonesian government published regulations that among other things imposed a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricts concentrate exports after january 12, 2017. despite pt-fi's rights under its cow to export concentrate without the payment of duties, pt-fi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from mid-january 2014 through july 2014. in july 2014, pt-fi and the indonesian government entered into a memorandum of understanding (mou) in which, subject to concluding an agreement to extend pt-fi's operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms, pt-fi agreed to construct new smelter capacity in indonesia and to divest an additional 20.64 percent interest in pt-fi at fair market value. under the mou, pt-fi provided a $115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development, agreed to increase royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties until certain smelter development milestones were met. the mou also anticipated an amendment of the cow within six months to address other matters; however, no terms of the cow other than those relating to the smelter bond, increased royalties and export duties were changed. in january 2015, the mou was extended to july 25, 2015, and it expired on that date. the indonesian government has continued to impose the increased royalty rates, export duties and smelter assurance bond. pt-fi paid export duties totaling $95 million in 2016 , $109 million in 2015 and $ 77 million in 2014 . in october 2015, the indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to pt-fi indicating that it would revise regulations allowing it to approve the extension of pt-fi's operations beyond 2021, and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under the current cow. in january and february 2017, the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. the new regulations permit the continuation of copper concentrate exports for a five-year period through january 2022, subject to various conditions, including conversion from a contract of work to a special operating license (known as an iupk, which provides virtually none of the protections of a contract of work), commitment to completion of smelter construction in five years and payment of export duties to be determined by the ministry of finance. in addition, the new regulations enable application for extension of operating rights five years before expiration of the iupk and require foreign iupk holders to divest 51 percent to indonesian interests no later than the tenth year of production. export licenses would be valid for one-year periods, subject to review every six months, depending on smelter construction progress. 17 table of contents the january 2017 regulations permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for pt smelting (ptfi's 25-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik, indonesia) to continue operating. pt smelting is seeking to renew its anode slimes export license; however, we cannot predict when pt smelting's anode slimes export license may be renewed. in addition, a labor strike at pt smelting has resulted in a shutdown of its operations since january 19, 2017. although pt-fi is taking near-term actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting, or approximately 40 percent of pt-fi's concentrate production capacity, on february 10, 2017, pt-fi was forced to suspend production as a result of limited storage capacity at pt-fi and pt smelting. pt smelting has indicated that it expects to resume operations in march 2017. delays in pt smelting obtaining its anode slimes export license or restarting operations could further impact pt-fi's operations. following the issuance of the january and february 2017 regulations and discussions with the government, pt-fi advised the indonesian government that it was prepared to convert its cow to an iupk, subject to obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty enumerated under its cow, and provided that the cow would remain in effect until it is replaced by a mutually satisfactory alternative. pt-fi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a five-year timeframe after approval of the extension of its long-term operating rights. under its cow, pt-fi has specified rights to export copper concentrate without restriction or payment of export duties. pt-fi has requested that concentrate exports be permitted without the imposition of export duties while the new license and stability agreement are negotiated. the indonesia government has indicated that in order to export its concentrate production, pt-fi would be required to immediately convert to an iupk, forgo its current rights to fiscal and legal certainty and commit to a new smelter prior to completing a long-term investment stability agreement. pt-fi has advised the indonesian government that attempts to enforce the new regulations on pt-fi violates its cow and that it is unwilling to terminate its cow unless replaced by a mutually acceptable form of agreement providing fiscal and legal assurances to support its long-term investment plans in papua, indonesia. as of february 24, 2017 , pt-fi has not obtained approval to export concentrate and production remains suspended. pt-fi is taking near-term actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting, or approximately 40 percent of pt-fi's concentrate production capacity (assuming that pt smelting's export license is approved and its operations are resumed in march 2017). pt-fi has begun to significantly adjust its cost structure, reduce its workforce and spending with local suppliers, and suspend investments in its underground development projects and new smelter. on february 17, 2017, pursuant to the cow's dispute resolution provisions, pt-fi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government's breaches and violations of the cow, which are described in item 1a. "risk factors." we cannot predict whether or when pt-fi will be able to resume exporting copper concentrate. for each month of delay in obtaining approval to export, pt-fi's share of production is projected to be reduced by approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 70 thousand ounces of gold. the inability of either pt-fi to export copper concentrate, or pt smelting to export anode slimes or restart operations, for any extended period of time would lead to the continued suspension of production in indonesia. we also cannot predict whether pt-fi will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of pt-fi's long-term mining rights. if pt-fi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion of risks associated with operations in indonesia. grasberg minerals district . pt-fi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua, indonesia, which is on the western half of the island of new guinea. we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967. the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines, the grasberg open pit, the deep ore zone (doz) underground mine and the big gossan underground mine where operations restarted in fourth-quarter 2016. in addition, in september 2015, pt-fi initiated pre-commercial production at the deep mill level zone (dmlz) underground mine. pt-fi also has several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit, including the grasberg block cave underground mine (refer to md&amp;a for further discussion). in aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to produce large-scale quantities of copper and gold 18 table of contents following the transition from the grasberg open pit. our current plans and mineral reserves at pt-fi assume that the cow will be extended beyond 2021 (refer to "regulatory matters" above for discussion of matters that could impact pt-fi's development plans). pt-fi's production, including our joint venture partner's share, totaled 1.1 billion pounds of copper and 1.1 million ounces of gold in 2016 , 752 million pounds of copper and 1.2 million ounces of gold in 2015 and 651 million pounds of copper and 1.1 million ounces of gold in 2014 . our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coal-fired power plant that we built in 1998. diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity. a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations. our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches. grasberg open pit pt-fi began open-pit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990 and is currently mining the final phase of the grasberg open pit, which contains high copper and gold ore grades. pt-fi expects to mine high-grade ore over the next several quarters prior to transitioning to the grasberg block cave underground mine during 2018. additionally, production from the ore stockpiles, which are located outside of the pit limits, is expected to continue until early 2019. production in the open pit is currently at the 3,310- to 3,520-meter elevation level and totaled 44 million metric tons of ore in 2016 , which provided 72 percent of pt-fi's 2016 mill feed. the current open-pit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units. the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 132 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 276 metric tons and 16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 17 to 42 cubic meters, which mined an average of 180,500 metric tons of material per day in 2016 , 250,400 metric tons per day in 2015 and 298,400 metric tons per day in 2014 . crushing and conveying systems are integral to the grasberg mine and provide the capacity to transport more than 250,000 metric tons of ore per day. during 2016 , grasberg's crushing and conveying systems delivered an average of 121,000 metric tons of ore per day to the mill. from january 2016 to may 2016, the grasberg overburden handling system delivered 1.9 million metric tons of overburden to the overburden stockpiles. the remaining overburden moved by haul trucks averaged 16,100 metric tons per day during 2016. ore milled from the grasberg open pit averaged 119,700 metric tons per day in 2016 , 115,900 metric tons per day in 2015 and 69,100 metric tons per day in 2014 . doz underground mine the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone. pt-fi began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open-stope mining methods, but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit. production resumed in september 2000 using the block-cave method and is at the 3,110-meter elevation level. the doz is a mature block-cave mine that previously operated at 80,000 metric tons of ore per day. current operating rates from the doz underground mine are driven by the value of the incremental doz ore grade compared to the ore from the grasberg open pit and ore grade material from the development of the dmlz and grasberg block cave underground mines. ore milled from the doz underground mine averaged 38,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2016, 43,700 metric tons of ore per day in 2015 and 50,500 metric tons of ore per day in 2014. production at the doz underground mine is expected to continue through 2021 and to ramp up to 60,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2017. the doz mine fleet consists of over 180 pieces of mobile equipment. the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 46 lhd units and 22 haul trucks. each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore. using ore passes and chutes, the lhd units transfer ore into 55-metric ton capacity haul trucks. the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers, and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing. the success of the development of the doz mine, one of the world's largest underground mines, provides confidence in the future development of pt-fi's large-scale, underground ore bodies. 19 table of contents dmlz underground mine the dmlz ore body lies below the doz underground mine at the 2,590-meter elevation and represents the downward continuation of mineralization in the ertsberg east skarn system and neighboring ertsberg porphyry. in september 2015, pt-fi initiated pre-commercial production at the dmlz underground mine, which represents ore extracted during the development phase for the purpose of obtaining access to the ore body. ore milled from the dmlz underground mine averaged 4,400 metric tons of ore per day in 2016 and 2,900 metric tons per day in 2015. targeted production rates once the dmlz underground mine reaches full capacity are expected to approximate 80,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022. production at the dmlz underground mine is expected to continue through 2041. the dmlz mine fleet consists of over 210 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes 24 lhd units and 16 haul trucks used in production and development activities. big gossan underground mine production from the big gossan ore body, which restarted in fourth-quarter 2016, is expected to ramp up to 7,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2022. the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site. it is a tabular, near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1,200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters. the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill. stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level. trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher. the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two-skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt. the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing. the big gossan mine fleet consists of over 71 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes 8 lhd units and 9 haul trucks used in development and production activities. description of ore bodies . our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite. the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them. the igneous-hosted ore bodies (the grasberg open pit and block cave, and portions of the doz block cave) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides, dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a lesser extent, bornite. the sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies (portions of the doz and all of the big gossan) occur as magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn replacements, whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions. the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite concentrations are common. moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district's ore bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals, though, in some deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite. 20 table of contents the following diagram indicates the relative elevations (in meters) of our reported indonesia ore bodies. the following map, which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers (approximately 16 square miles), indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported indonesia ore bodies and their locations. smelting facilities and other mining properties atlantic copper . our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva, spain, port authorities, which are scheduled to expire in 2027. the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 295,000 metric tons of copper per year, and the refinery has a capacity of 285,000 metric tons of copper per year. atlantic copper produced 296,900 metric tons of copper anode 21 table of contents from its smelter and 285,800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016 ; 293,100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 284,800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2015; and 294,100 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 283,800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2014. following is a summary of atlantic copper's concentrate purchases from third parties and our copper mining operations for the years ended december 31: 2016 2015 2014 third parties 77 % 71 % 50 % north america copper mines 13 23 21 south america mining 7 3 a 21 indonesia mining 3 3 8 100 % 100 % 100 % a. lower purchases from the south america mines primarily reflect the impact of the november 2014 sale of the candelaria and ojos del salado mines. atlantic copper's major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years, with shorter-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. atlantic copper completed a 68-day major maintenance turnaround in 2013 and a 13-day shorter-term maintenance in 2015. the next 21-day maintenance turnaround is scheduled for second-quarter 2017. pt smelting . pt-fi's cow required us to construct, or cause to be constructed, a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable. in 1995, following the completion of a feasibility study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting, an indonesian company, and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik, indonesia. pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery. pt-fi owns 25 percent of pt smelting, with the remainder owned by mitsubishi materials corporation (60.5 percent), mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd. (9.5 percent) and jx nippon mining &amp; metals corporation (5 percent). pt-fi's contract with pt smelting requires pt-fi to supply 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements (at market rates subject to a minimum or maximum treatment charge rate) necessary for pt smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. an extension of the minimum and maximum treatment charge rate, which expires in april 2017, is currently being negotiated. pt-fi may also sell copper concentrate to pt smelting at market rates for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. pt-fi supplied 88 percent of pt smelting's concentrate requirements in 2016 and approximately 80 percent in both 2015 and 2014. pt smelting produced 255,700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 241,700 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2016 ; 199,700 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 198,400 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2015; and 236,900 metric tons of copper anode from its smelter and 231,800 metric tons of copper cathode from its refinery in 2014. following a temporary suspension in july 2015, pt smelting operated at approximately 80 percent capacity from september 2015 to november 2015 when required repairs of an acid plant cooling tower that was damaged during the suspension were completed. pt smelting's maintenance turnarounds (which range from two weeks to a month to complete) typically are expected to occur approximately every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. pt smelting completed a 25-day maintenance turnaround during 2016, and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2018. in january and february 2017, the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. these regulations permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for pt smelting to continue operating. pt smelting is seeking to renew its anode slimes export license; however, we cannot predict when pt smelting's anode slimes export license may be renewed. in addition, a labor strike at pt smelting has resulted in a shutdown of its operations since january 19, 2017. pt smelting has indicated that it expects to resume operations in march 2017. refer to item 1a. risk factors for further discussion of indonesia regulatory matters. 22 table of contents miami smelter . we own and operate a smelter at our miami mining operation in arizona. the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies, to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements. the miami smelter is installing emission control equipment that will allow it to operate in compliance with adopted air quality standards (refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion). the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our north america copper mines. concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 673,300 metric tons in 2016 , 686,700 metric tons in 2015 and 603,700 metric tons in 2014. in addition, because sulphuric acid is a by-product of smelting concentrate, the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations (refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion). major maintenance turnarounds (which take approximately three weeks to complete) typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. the miami smelter completed a major maintenance turnaround in third-quarter 2016, and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for second-quarter 2017. rod &amp; refining operations . our rod &amp; refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america, including a refinery in el paso, texas; rod mills in el paso, texas, norwich, connecticut, and miami, arizona; and a specialty copper products facility in bayway, new jersey. we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery. the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode, which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at our miami smelter. our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate, copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold, silver, platinum and palladium. molybdenum conversion facilities . we process molybdenum concentrate at our conversion plants in the u.s. and europe into such products as technical-grade molybdic oxide, ferromolybdenum, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide. we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita, arizona; fort madison, iowa; and rotterdam, the netherlands, and we operate a molybdenum pressure-leach plant in bagdad, arizona. we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket, united kingdom. freeport cobalt . in march 2013, we acquired a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola, finland, and the related sales and marketing business which provided direct end-market access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke mine. the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt, and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest. the remaining effective ownership interest is held by lundin mining corporation (24 percent) and la g n rale des carri res et des mines (20 percent). the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 15,000 metric tons of cobalt. as further discussed in note 2, we have agreed to negotiate exclusively with china molybdenum co., ltd. until february 28, 2017, to enter into a definitive agreement to sell our interest in freeport cobalt for $100 million. other north america copper mines . we also have five non-operating copper mines in north america ajo, bisbee, twin buttes and tohono in arizona, and cobre in new mexico that have been on care-and-maintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies, new permits, and additional capital investment, which could be significant, to return them to operating status. mining development projects and exploration capital expenditures for mining operations totaled $1.6 billion (including $1.2 billion for major projects) in 2016 , $3.3 billion (including $2.4 billion for major projects) in 2015 and $4.0 billion (including $2.9 billion for major projects) in 2014 . capital expenditures for major projects during the three years ended december 31, 2016 , were primarily associated with expansion projects at morenci and cerro verde, and underground development activities at grasberg. refer to md&amp;a for projected capital expenditures for the year 2017. pt-fi has begun suspending investments in its underground development projects, pending resolution of its long-term mining rights. if pt-fi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, we may be required to further reduce or defer investments in underground development projects. we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies. as further discussed in md&amp;a, our near-term major development projects primarily include the underground development activities in the grasberg minerals district. considering the long- 23 table of contents term nature and large size of our development projects, actual costs and timing could vary from estimates. additionally, in response to market conditions and indonesian regulatory uncertainty, the timing of our expenditures will continue to be reviewed. as further discussed in "mining operations - indonesia," pt-fi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a five year timeframe after obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty enumerated under pt-fi's cow, which has not been received as of february 24, 2017 . as a result, pt-fi has begun suspending investments in its underground development projects and new smelter. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion of indonesia regulatory matters. we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves. we also have an additional long-term underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body, which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2,605-meter elevation level. we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the block-cave method; aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate $2.6 billion (which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2031). additionally, our current mine development plans include approximately $5.7 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg open-pit operations cease. we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be made between 2019 and 2034. if pt-fi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its long-term mining rights, we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects. our mining exploration activities are generally associated with our existing mines focusing on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity. exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future potential reserve additions in north and south america. exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled $44 million in 2016 , $96 million in 2015 and $182 million in 2014 . exploration spending is expected to approximate $47 million for the year 2017 . sources and availability of energy, natural resources and raw materials our copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. energy represented approximately 20 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2016 and included purchases of approximately 214 million gallons of diesel fuel; 8,400 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north and south america copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation); 780 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia; and 1 million mmbtu (british thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our north america mines. based on current cost projections, we estimate energy will approximate 20 percent of our copper mine site operating costs in 2017 . our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. the loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations. for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water, refer to item 1a. risk factors and item 3. legal proceedings. sulphuric acid is used in the sx/ew process and is produced as a by-product of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulfur burners at the safford mine. sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties. as further discussed in item 1a. "risk factors," if production were to be curtailed at the miami smelter, we would be required to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid from third parties, thereby increasing our operating costs. community and human rights we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations. we continue to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs, which include: comprehensive job training programs basic education programs public health programs, including malaria control and human immunodeficiency virus agricultural assistance programs small and medium enterprise development programs 24 table of contents cultural promotion and preservation programs clean water and sanitation projects community infrastructure development charitable donations in december 2000, we endorsed the joint u.s. state department-british foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security (voluntary principles). we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy. the voluntary principles provide guidelines for our security programs, including interaction with host-government security personnel, private security contractors and our internal security employees. we completed a corporate level human rights impact assessment in 2014, the results of which were used to evaluate our human rights program, including a review of our human rights policy. in february 2015, we updated our human rights policy to, among other things, reflect our commitment to integrating the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our human rights program. we have embarked on a program to plan and conduct site-level human rights impact assessments at operations with higher potential risks. we also participate in a multi-industry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and are integrating human rights due diligence into our business practices. we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations. as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainable community development, we make significant investments in social programs, including in-kind support and administration, across our global operations. over the last five years, these investments have averaged $170 million per year. nevertheless, social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations. refer to item 1a. risk factors for further discussion. south america . cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years. following engagements with regional and local governments, civic leaders and development agencies, in 2006, cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa. in addition, an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage network that was financed by cerro verde and a distribution network that was financed by the cerro verde civil association (the association). the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education, training, health, cultural preservation and basic infrastructure. cerro verde reached an agreement with the regional government of arequipa, the national government, sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance, engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa, which was completed in 2015. the wastewater treatment plant supplements existing water supplies to support cerro verde's concentrator expansion and also improves the regional water quality, enhances agriculture products grown in the area and reduces waterborne illnesses. in addition to these projects, cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region. security matters . consistent with our operating permits in peru and our commitment to protect our employees and property, we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. as part of its security program, cerro verde maintains its own internal security department. both employees and contractors perform functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring shipments of supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. the security department receives human rights and voluntary principles training annually. some contractors assigned to protection of expatriate personnel are armed. these contractors receive training in motivation and defensive driving weekly; human rights and voluntary principles monthly; and firearms quarterly. cerro verde's costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $6 million in both 2016 and 2015 and $7 million in 2014. cerro verde, and all businesses and residents of peru, rely on the peruvian government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. the peruvian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations. since 1997, the peruvian government has relied on cerro verde to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the peruvian government. cerro verde's financial support for the peruvian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged, 25 table of contents and have the logistical resources to secure cerro verde's operating area. in addition, providing such support reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship, and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that promote human rights. cerro verde's share of support costs for the government-provided security approximated $1 million in each of the years 2016, 2015 and 2014. this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police. indonesia . in 1996, pt-fi established the freeport partnership fund for community development (the partnership fund) through which pt-fi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education and economic development of the area. pt-fi has committed through 2018 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operations through the partnership fund. pt-fi recognized $33 million in 2016 , $27 million in 2015 and $31 million in 2014 for this commitment. the amungme and kamoro community development organization ( lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or lpmak) oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund. lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors, which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities, government leaders, church leaders, and one representative of pt-fi on each board. the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations. in addition to the partnership fund, pt-fi annually makes significant investments in public health, education, community infrastructure and economic development. security matters . consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property, we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. as part of its security program, pt-fi maintains its own internal security department. both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring shipments of supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. the security department receives human rights training annually. pt-fi's share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $58 million for both 2016 and 2015 and $57 million for 2014 . pt-fi, and all businesses and residents of indonesia, rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia's vital national assets. this designation results in the police, and to a lesser extent, the military, playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations. from the outset of pt-fi's operations, the indonesian government has looked to pt-fi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua. pt-fi's financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged, and have the logistical resources to patrol pt-fi's roads and secure its operating area. in addition, the provision of such support is consistent with pt-fi's obligations under the cow, reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship, and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights. pt-fi's share of support costs for the government-provided security was $20 million in 2016 , $21 million in 2015 and $27 million in 2014 . this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police.

31,1994, and 60 percent of all remaining cash flow. 31 table of contents in defining our open-pit reserves, we apply a variable cutoff grade strategy. the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations. we use a "break-even cutoff grade" to define the in-situ reserves for our underground ore bodies. the break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production. our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals, such as gold, molybdenum and silver. we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade. copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal. the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade. the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31, 2016 : copper equivalent cutoff grade (percent) molybdenum cutoff grade (percent) mill crushed or agitation leach rom

achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit. the following table sets forth the average drill

following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and from related stockpiles. the chart also shows the term of pt-fi's cow. production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life. the sequencing dates shown in the chart below include development activity that results in metal production. the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors, including the results of our exploration and development efforts, and may vary from the dates shown below. in addition, we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies. significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the life-of-mine plans reflected below. mill and leach stockpiles mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery. mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities. because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low 34 table of contents percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. for newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31, 2016 :

properties, which represented 90 percent of our total proved reserves as of december 31, 2015, and 83 percent of our total oil and natural gas production for the year ended december 31, 2016. in january 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell our property interests in the madden area in central wyoming. following the completion of the madden transaction, our portfolio of oil and gas assets would include oil and natural gas production onshore in south louisiana and on the gom shelf and oil production offshore california, which had total oil and gas sales volumes of 6.4 mmboe in 2016. acreage at december 31, 2016 , we owned interests in oil and gas leases covering 411 thousand gross acres ( 218 thousand acres net to our interest), consisting of 325 thousand gross ( 160 thousand net) of developed acres and 86 thousand gross ( 58 thousand net) of undeveloped acres. developed acres are acres spaced or assigned to productive wells and do not include undrilled acreage held by production under the terms of the lease. undeveloped acres are acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil or gas, regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. exploration and development activities capital expenditures for our oil and gas operations totaled $1.2 billion in 2016 (including $0.6 billion incurred for gom and $0.5 billion for changes in capital expenditure accruals), $3.0 billion in 2015 (including $ 2.6 billion incurred for gom) and $3.2 billion in 2014 (including $2.6

states (u.s.) federal securities laws. forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; operating cash flows; capital expenditures; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities and costs; liquidity; tax rates; the impact of copper, gold and molybdenum price changes; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; future dividend payments; and share purchases and sales. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. we caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following: financial risks declines in the market prices of copper and molybdenum have adversely affected our earnings, cash flows and asset values and, if sustained, may adversely affect our ability to repay debt. fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold and molybdenum have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in our financial performance and in the trading prices of our debt and common stock. our financial results will vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper and gold, and to a lesser extent molybdenum. as described below, beginning in 2015, copper prices declined significantly, before recovering in fourth-quarter 2016. if prices decline in the future, they may have a material adverse effect on our financial results, the value of our assets and/or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations; and may depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities. in response to market-conditions, beginning in the second half of 2015, we made adjustments to operating plans for our mining operations, including reducing operating and capital costs and adjusting production at our north america copper mines; reducing mining and stacking rates at our el abra mine in chile by approximately 50 percent to achieve lower operating and labor costs, defer capital expenditures and extend the life of the operation; and operating the henderson molybdenum mine in colorado at reduced rates. if market prices for our primary commodities decline or persist at low levels, we may have to further revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, in which case we may incur additional losses, and those losses may be material. fluctuations in commodities prices are caused by varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels; global economic and political conditions; international regulatory, trade and tax policies; commodities investment activity and speculation; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. copper prices may be affected by demand from china, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, and by changes in demand for industrial, commercial and residential products containing copper. copper prices declined significantly during 2015 and remained low throughout most of 2016, with london metal exchange (lme) spot copper prices averaging $2.21 per pound in 2016, $2.49 per pound in 2015 and $3.11 per pound in 2014. during fourth-quarter 2016, copper prices improved, with the lme spot price averaging $2.39 per pound. the lme spot copper price was $2.50 per pound on december 31, 2016 , and $2.73 per pound on february 15, 2017 . factors affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the u.s. dollar to other currencies, inflation and interest rate expectations, purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from china and india, two of the world ' s largest consumers of gold, and global demand for jewelry containing gold. the london pm gold price averaged $1,250 per ounce in 2016, $1,160 per ounce in 2015 and $1,266 per ounce in 2014. the london pm gold price was $1,224 per ounce on february 15, 2017 . 39 table of contents molybdenum prices also declined significantly during 2015 and have remained low throughout 2016, with the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price averaging $6.47 per pound in 2016, $6.66 per pound in 2015 and $11.41 per pound in 2014. the metals week molybdenum dealer oxide weekly average price was $7.59 per pound on february 15, 2017 . lower copper and molybdenum prices during 2016 and 2015 resulted in non-cash charges for inventory adjustments ( $36 million for the year 2016 and $338 million for the year 2015) and long-lived mining asset impairments ( $37 million for the year 2015). refer to notes 4 and 5 for additional information. declines in copper and/or molybdenum prices could result in additional metals inventory adjustments and impairment charges for our long-lived assets. other events that could result in impairment of our long-lived assets include, but are not limited to, decreases in estimated proven and probable mineral reserves and any event that might have a material adverse effect on mine production costs. our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility. at december 31, 2016 , our total consolidated debt was $ 16.0 billion (see note 8) and our total consolidated cash was $4.2 billion . we also have various other financial commitments, including reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following: limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we operate; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and/or material contingencies, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt; requiring us to sell assets to reduce debt; or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments. any failure to comply with the financial and other covenants in our debt agreements may result in an event of default that would allow the creditors to accelerate maturities of the related debt, which in turn may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt agreements. our available cash and liquidity would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our debt instruments that are accelerated upon an event of default. from august 2015 through november 2016, we sold 326.5 million shares of our common stock under registered at-the-market equity programs, which generated $3.5 billion in gross proceeds (refer to note 10). in addition, during 2016, we issued 48.1 million shares of our common stock in connection with the settlement of two drilling rig contracts (refer to note 13) and 27.7 million shares of our common stock in exchange for $369 million of fcx senior notes (refer to note 10). any additional issuance of equity capital to fund operations, reduce debt, improve our financial position or for other purposes, may have a negative impact on our stock price. as of february 15, 2017 , our senior unsecured debt was rated "bb-" with a stable outlook by standard &amp; poor's (s&amp;p), "bbb-" with a negative outlook by fitch ratings (fitch), and "b1" with a positive outlook by moody's investors service (moody's). there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. for more information, refer to the risk factor below relating to mine closure and reclamation regulations and plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas operations. 40 table of contents mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our remaining oil and gas properties, and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations. changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. we are required by u.s. federal and state laws and regulations to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans for our mining properties if we are unable to do so. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and state agencies may also require financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980 (cercla) or similar state laws. refer to note 12 for additional information regarding our financial assurance obligations. with respect to our mining operations, most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction, depending on how each state regulates land use and groundwater quality. although section 108(b) of cercla has required epa to identify classes of facilities that must establish evidence of financial responsibility since it was adopted in 1980, currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under cercla. in august 2014, several environmental organizations initiated litigation against epa to require it to set a schedule for adopting financial assurance regulations under cercla governing the hard rock mining industry. epa and the environmental organizations reached a joint agreement and submitted it to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for approval. notwithstanding industry objections, the court approved the agreement on january 29, 2016, thereby requiring the epa to propose financial assurance regulations for the hard rock mining industry by december 1, 2016, and to provide notice of its final action by december 1, 2017. the proposed regulations were published on january 11, 2017, subject to a 60-day comment period. the proposed rules, if promulgated without material modification, would result in onerous financial responsibility obligations for our u.s. hard rock mining operations, and the form, cost and availability of financial mechanisms necessary to meet such obligations is uncertain (if they could be met at all). in addition, complying with these obligations could be very costly, harm the international competitiveness of our u.s. hard rock mining operations and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our remaining oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws, including financial responsibility required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill. in 2016, the u.s. bureau of ocean energy management issued revised requirements for lessees operating in federal waters to secure the cost of plugging, abandoning, decommissioning and/or removing wells, platforms and pipelines at the end of production. the revised requirements eliminate previously provided waivers from requirements to post security. the new requirements to post significant amounts of security in the form of bonds or similar assurances could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. the cost for bonds or assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases. as of december 31, 2016 , our financial assurance obligations totaled $1.1 billion for closure and reclamation/restoration costs of u.s. mining sites, and $0.7 billion for plugging and abandonment obligations of our remaining oil and gas operations (refer to note 12). a substantial portion of our financial assurance obligations are satisfied by fcx guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. as a result of the downgrade of our credit ratings on our debt to below investment grade by s&amp;p and moody's, we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or collateral. these other forms of assurance are costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of the affected properties. refer to notes 1 and 12 , for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations. unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business or are associated with environmental issues arising from legacy operations conducted over the years by freeport minerals corporation (fmc) and its affiliates, including those described in 41 table of contents note 12 and in item 3. "legal proceedings" involving matters such as remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, claims of personal injury or property damage arising from such contamination or from exposure to substances such as lead, arsenic, asbestos, talc and other allegedly toxic substances, disputes over water rights, and disputes with foreign governments or regulatory authorities over royalties, taxes, rights and obligations under concession or other agreements, or other matters. we are also involved periodically in other reviews, inquiries, investigations and other proceedings initiated by or involving government agencies, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. in addition, from time to time we are involved in disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites. the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcome of any individual legal proceeding will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although individual or cumulative outcomes could be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on the nature and magnitude of the outcome and the operating results for the period. with respect to the asbestos exposure cases described in note 12, there has been an increase in the number of cases against fmc and its affiliates alleging exposure to talc contaminated with asbestos and to talc that is not alleged to be contaminated with asbestos. recently, there have been a limited number of large jury awards in single plaintiff cases primarily brought by consumers against makers of common consumer products containing talc and alleging serious health risks, including ovarian cancer associated with long-term use of such products. prior affiliates were involved in talc mining, and some of those affiliates have been named as defendants in some of those cases. we have indemnification rights against a successor to those businesses, and the successor has acknowledged those indemnification obligations and has taken responsibility for all cases we have tendered to it. however, the indemnitor may have limited financial resources and limited amounts of insurance available to meet those obligations. international risks our international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the u.s. we are a u.s.-based mining company with substantial assets located outside of the u.s. we conduct international mining operations in indonesia, peru and chile. accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the u.s., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries. risks of conducting business in countries outside of the u.s. include: renegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts; expropriation or nationalization of property; changes in the host country's laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters, which because of rising "resource nationalism" in countries around the world, may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment; political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism; changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities in which we operate with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety, infrastructure and community development and other factors that may affect our social license to operate, all of which lead to increased costs; changes in u.s. trade, tax, immigration or other policies that may harm relations with foreign countries or result in retaliatory policies; foreign exchange controls and movements in foreign currency exchange rates; and 42 table of contents the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory. our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the u.s. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. our international operations must comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws in recent years, and a steadily increasing focus on enforcement of those laws continues. any violation of those laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities (refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters). other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below. because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in indonesia. our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia (pt-fi) pursuant to a contract of work (cow) with the indonesian government. maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among indonesia's most significant business enterprises. partially because of their significance to indonesia's economy, the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, and the number of people employed, our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. for further discussion of the history of pt-fi's cow, refer to note 13 . the initial term of pt-fi's cow expires in 2021, but the cow explicitly provides that it can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to indonesian government approval, which cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. pt-fi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow, including extending its term. notwithstanding provisions in the cow prohibiting it from doing so, the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts, including pt-fi's cow, to address provisions contained in the mining law enacted in 2009; and mining regulations adopted thereunder, including provisions that conflict with the cow, such as the size of contract concessions, government revenues, domestic processing of minerals, divestment, provision of local goods and services, conversion from a cow to a licensing framework for extension periods, and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a cow's expiration. regulations published in january 2014 imposed, among other things, a progressive export duty on copper concentrate and restricted exports of copper concentrate and anode slimes (a by-product of the copper refining process containing metals, including gold) after january 12, 2017. despite pt-fi's rights under its cow to export concentrate without the payment of duties, pt-fi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from mid-january 2014 through july 2014. in july 2014, pt-fi entered into a memorandum of understanding (mou) with the indonesian government, in which, subject to concluding an agreement to extend pt-fi's operations beyond 2021 on acceptable terms, pt-fi agreed to construct new smelter capacity in indonesia and to divest an additional 20.64 percent interest at fair value. under the mou, pt-fi provided a $115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development, agreed to pay higher royalty rates and agreed to pay export duties until certain smelter development milestones were met. the mou also anticipated an amendment of the cow within six months to address other matters; however, no terms of the cow other than those relating to the smelter bond, increased royalties and export duties were changed. in january 2015, the mou was extended to july 25, 2015, and it expired on that date. the indonesian government has continued to impose the increased royalty rates, export duties and smelter assurance bond. 43 table of contents in october 2015, the indonesian government provided a letter of assurance to pt-fi indicating that it would revise regulations allowing it to approve the extension of pt-fi's operations beyond 2021, and provide the same rights and the same level of legal and fiscal certainty provided under the current cow. in january and february 2017, the indonesian government issued new regulations to address exports of unrefined metals, including copper concentrate and anode slimes, and other matters related to the mining sector. the new regulations permit the continuation of copper concentrate exports for a five-year period through january 2022, subject to various conditions, including conversion from a contract of work to a special operating license (known as an iupk, which provides virtually none of the protections of a contract of work), commitment to completion of smelter construction in five years and payment of export duties to be determined by the ministry of finance. in addition, the new regulations enable application for extension of operating rights five years before expiration of the iupk and require foreign iupk holders to divest 51 percent to indonesian interests no later than the tenth year of production. export licenses would be valid for one-year periods, subject to review every six months, depending on smelter construction progress. the january 2017 regulations permit the export of anode slimes, which is necessary for pt smelting (ptfi's 25-percent-owned copper smelter and refinery located in gresik, indonesia) to continue operating. pt smelting is seeking to renew its anode slimes export license; however, we cannot predict when pt smelting's anode slimes export license may be renewed. in addition, a labor strike at pt smelting has resulted in a shutdown of its operations since january 19, 2017. although pt-fi is taking near-term actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting, or approximately 40 percent of pt-fi's concentrate production capacity, on february 10, 2017, pt-fi was forced to suspend production as a result of limited storage capacity at pt-fi and pt smelting. pt smelting has indicated that it expects to resume operations in march 2017. delays in pt smelting obtaining its anode slimes export license or restarting operations could further impact pt-fi's operations. following the issuance of the january and february 2017 regulations and discussions with the government, pt-fi advised the indonesian government that it was prepared to convert its cow to an iupk, subject to obtaining an investment stability agreement providing equivalent rights with the same level of legal and fiscal certainty enumerated under its cow, and provided that the cow would remain in effect until it is replaced by a mutually satisfactory alternative. pt-fi also committed to commence construction of a new smelter during a five-year timeframe after approval of the extension of its long-term operating rights. under its cow, pt-fi has specified rights to export copper concentrate without restriction or payment of export duties. pt-fi has requested that concentrate exports be permitted without the imposition of export duties while the new license and stability agreement are negotiated. the indonesia government has indicated that in order to export its concentrate production, pt-fi would be required to immediately convert to an iupk, forgo its current rights to fiscal and legal certainty and commit to a new smelter prior to completing a long-term investment stability agreement. pt-fi has advised the indonesian government that attempts to enforce the new regulations on pt-fi violates its cow and that it is unwilling to terminate its cow unless replaced by a mutually acceptable form of agreement providing fiscal and legal assurances to support its long-term investment plans in papua, indonesia. as of february 24, 2017 , pt-fi has not obtained approval to export concentrate and production remains suspended. pt-fi is taking near-term actions to reduce production to match available processing capacity at pt smelting, or approximately 40 percent of pt-fi's concentrate production capacity (assuming that pt smelting's export license is approved and its operations are resumed in march 2017). pt-fi has begun to significantly adjust its cost structure, reduce its workforce and spending with local suppliers, and suspend investments in its underground development projects and new smelter. on february 17, 2017, pursuant to the cow's dispute resolution provisions, pt-fi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government's breaches and violations of the cow as described in the risk factor below pt-fi's cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel. we cannot predict whether or when pt-fi will be able to resume exporting copper concentrate. for each month of delay in obtaining approval to export, pt-fi's share of production is projected to be reduced by approximately 70 million pounds of copper and 70 thousand ounces of gold. the inability of either pt-fi to export copper concentrate, or pt smelting to export anode slimes or restart operations, for any extended period of time would lead to the 44 table of contents continued suspension of production in indonesia, which would have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position, and could result in asset impairments, inventory write downs, difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities, and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves. we also cannot predict whether pt-fi will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of its long-term mining rights. if pt-fi is unable to reach agreement with the indonesian government on its long-term rights, we may be required to reduce or defer investments in underground development projects, which would have a material adverse effect on our future production, cash flow, results of operations and financial position, and could result in asset impairments, inventory write downs, difficulty in meeting covenants under our credit facilities, and a significant reduction in our reported mineral reserves. in october 2016, a new minister of energy and mineral resources was appointed, and is the fourth person to hold the office since july 2016. we cannot predict what impact the transition will have on the progress or outcome of pt-fi's license and stability agreement negotiations. pt-fi's cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel. pt-fi's cow was entered into under indonesia's 1967 foreign capital investment law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements. recently adopted indonesian laws and regulations conflict with the mining rights established under the cow. although the cow grants to pt-fi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow, government agencies have sought and continue to seek to impose additional restrictions on pt-fi that could affect exploration and operating requirements. for further discussion, refer to the above risk factor "because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in indonesia." pt-fi's cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. on february 17, 2017, pursuant to the cow's formal dispute resolution provisions, pt-fi provided formal notice to the indonesian government of an impending dispute listing the government's breaches and violations of the cow, including, but not limited to, the following: restrictions on pt-fi's basic right to export mining products in violation of the cow; imposition of export duties other than those taxes and other charges expressly provided for in the cow; imposition of surface water taxes in excess of the restrictions imposed by the cow (refer to note 12 for further discussion of these assessments); requirement for pt-fi to build a smelter, while such requirements are not contained in the cow; unreasonable withholding and delay in granting approval of two successive ten-year extensions of the term of the cow; and imposition of divestment requirements that are not provided for in the cow. if the dispute is not resolved by june 17, 2017, pt-fi may commence arbitration under the united nations commission on international trade law (uncitral) arbitration rules to enforce all provisions of the cow and seek damages, specifically in respect of the issuance of the january 11, 2017, regulations which are not in accordance with honoring the contractual commitments of the indonesian government and pt-fi under the cow. the arbitration proceedings would take place in jakarta, indonesia, and for limited purposes, would be overseen by the indonesian courts under the indonesian arbitration act. the international arbitration process is complex and could take considerable time to complete and there is no assurance that we will prevail. if we prevail, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory. additionally, our operations may be materially and adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending. 45 table of contents at times, certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998 ( i.e., during the suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including pt-fi's cow, which was signed in december 1991. we cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons. we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires. our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. as a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow. prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 17 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31, 2016 , representing 22 percent of pt-fi's share of recoverable copper reserves and 33 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves. there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions. for further discussion, refer to the above risk factors "because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in indonesia" and "pt-fi's cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel." operational risks our mining operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business. our mines are very large in scale and, by their nature are subject to significant operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. these operational risks, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flow, include earthquakes, rainstorms, floods, and other natural disasters; equipment failures; accidents; wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses of our underground mines or tailings impoundments; and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates. the waste rock (including overburden) and tailings produced in our mining operations represent our largest volume of waste. managing the volume of waste rock and tailings presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks. we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material, which are effectively large dams that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse. our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage at all of our operations. in indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks, as discussed below. the failure of tailings and other impoundments at any of our mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life, and we apply significant financial resources and both internal and external technical resources to the effective, safe management of all those facilities. the importance of careful design, management and monitoring of large impoundments was emphasized in recent years by large scale tailings dam failures at unaffiliated mines, which caused extensive property and environmental damage and resulted in the loss of life. as a member company of the international council on mining and metals (icmm), we intend to augment our existing practices to be consistent with the icmm's tailings governance framework adopted in december 2016 in an effort to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure of tailings storage facilities. labor unrest, activism and civil and religious strife could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. as of december 31, 2016 , approximately half of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately one third of our global labor force was covered by agreements that have expired and are currently being negotiated or will expire during 2017, including the agreement covering employees at our pt-fi operations in indonesia. labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we 46 table of contents may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected. refer to items 1. and 2., "business and properties," for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements. we could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts that could adversely affect our operations. for example, in october 2014, a large percentage of grasberg open-pit operators did not report to their scheduled shifts and during third-quarter 2016, pt-fi experienced labor productivity issues and a 10-day work stoppage that began in late september 2016. these labor productivity issues have continued during fourth-quarter 2016 and early 2017, and could be heightened by the workforce reductions that began in february 2017. significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes, which could adversely affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. indonesia has long faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua, where our grasberg minerals district is located. in papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military. in addition, illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities. social, economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations. in 2009, a series of shooting incidents occurred within the pt-fi project area, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations. the shooting incidents have continued on a sporadic basis with the last incident occurring on january 1, 2015. during this time, there were 20 fatalities and 59 injuries to our employees, contractor employees, government security personnel and civilians. to date, no one person or group has claimed responsibility for the shootings. the safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and pt-fi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues. the investigation of these incidents is ongoing. we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys. we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations. if other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time. our mining operations depend on the availability of secure water supplies. our mining operations require physical availability and secure legal rights to significant quantities of water for mining and ore processing activities, and related support facilities. most of our north and south america mining operations are in areas where competition for water supplies is significant. continuous production at our mines is dependent on many factors, including our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. in arizona, where our operations use both surface and ground water, we are a participant in an active general stream adjudication in which the arizona courts have been attempting, for over 40 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for the gila river, one of the state's largest river systems, which primarily affects our morenci, safford and sierrita mines. the adjudication is addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as significant federal water claims that are potentially adverse to the state law claims of both surface water and groundwater users. groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law, which historically allowed land owners to pump unlimited quantities of subsurface water, subject only to the requirement of putting it to "reasonable use." however, court decisions in the adjudication have concluded that underground water is often hydrologically connected to surface water so that it actually is surface water and is therefore subject to the arizona doctrine of prior appropriation, as a result of which it would be subject to the adjudication and potentially unavailable to groundwater pumpers in the absence of valid surface water claims, which historic groundwater pumpers typically do not have. any re-characterization of groundwater as surface water could affect the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. because we are a user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceeding. 47 table of contents water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collects water primarily from seasonal precipitation. as a result of occasional drought conditions, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our cerro verde operations. in january 2016, the peruvian government declared a temporary state of emergency with respect to the water supply in the rio chili basin because of drought conditions. as a result, the cerro verde water rights from the rio chili were temporarily decreased during february 2016. water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascot n aquifer. in 2010, el abra obtained regulatory approval for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascot n aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. the agreement to pump from this aquifer is subject to continued monitoring of the aquifer level to ensure that environmentally sensitive areas are not impacted by our pumping. if impact occurs, we would have to reduce pumping to restore water levels, which could have an adverse effect on production from el abra. although we typically have sufficient water for our indonesian operations, lower rainfall resulting from el ni o weather conditions affected operations in the second half of 2015 and may do so again in the future. although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, as discussed above some supplies are subject to adjudication proceedings, the outcome of which we cannot predict, and the availability of additional supplies that may be required for potential future expansions is uncertain. while we are taking actions to acquire additional back-up water supples, such supplies may not be available at acceptable cost, or at all, so that the loss of a water right or currently available water supply could force us to curtail operations or force premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations. in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our indonesia mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and on unusually difficult terrain. the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia. these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. in addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster. underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in may 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at pt-fi when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed. pt-fi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed open-pit mining and concentrating activities on june 24, 2013, and underground operations on july 9, 2013. no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future. we must continually replace reserves depleted by production, but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries. our existing mineral reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. because our profits are primarily derived from our mining operations, our ability to replenish our mineral reserves is essential to our long-term success. our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits that can be produced profitably. we may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. consolidated capital expenditures are expected to approximate $1.8 billion for 2017, including $1.1 billion for major projects primarily associated with underground development activities at grasberg and $0.7 billion for sustaining capital. refer to the risk factor "because our grasberg mining operation in indonesia is a significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in indonesia" for further discussion of regulatory matters in indonesia that may impact future investments in pt-fi's underground development projects. 48 table of contents there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects. the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, estimated capital and operating costs, and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity. the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or timing can adversely affect project economics. new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. the actual costs, production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. our operations are subject to extensive regulations, some of which require permits and other approvals. these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations. our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. as a natural resource company, compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business. for additional information, see "environmental risks" below. we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety, including the requirements of the u.s. occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions. in the u.s., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the u.s. mine safety and health administration (msha) under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977. msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred. if such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. many other governmental bodies regulate other aspects of our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. in addition, new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions. cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. we believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition. environmental risks our operations are subject to complex, evolving and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain existing operations or expansion opportunities. our operations, both in the u.s. and internationally, are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances; solid waste disposal; air emissions; wastewater discharges; remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including mine closures and reclamation; well plug and abandonment requirements; protection of endangered and protected species and designation of critical habitats; and other related matters. in addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations. our miami, arizona smelter processes approximately half of the aggregate copper concentrate produced by our north america copper mines. epa regulations require us to invest in new pollution control equipment to reduce sulfur dioxide (so 2 ) to meet both regional haze requirements and to allow the state of arizona to demonstrate compliance with epa's so 2 ambient air quality standards. the deadline for the smelter to install the so 2 pollution 49 table of contents control equipment to comply with the regional haze rules is january 1, 2018. arizona regulators have promulgated rules for complying with the national ambient air quality standards, which must be approved by the epa to become effective, but it is possible that they will be effective prior to january 1, 2018. in order to meet both regulatory requirements, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $250 million, and we expect those expenditures to be made through 2018. if these expenditures are delayed or deferred for technical, financial or any other reasons, we may be forced to curtail production at the miami smelter, which would require us to export concentrate rather than process it ourselves and to purchase sulphuric acid that would otherwise be generated during the smelting process, which would result in increased production costs. laws such as cercla and similar state laws may expose us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by our operations, or by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by fmc and certain of its affiliates. noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. in addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as other factors. new or revised environmental regulatory requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business, including those regarding financial assurance in the financial risk factor above. in addition, in 2015, the epa promulgated rules that could reclassify certain mineral processing materials as "hazardous waste" under the federal resource conservation and recovery act and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements. these rules are currently being challenged by multiple parties in court; however, if the legal challenges are unsuccessful, and the regulatory agencies reclassify certain mineral processing materials as hazardous waste," costs at our u.s. copper and molybdenum processing facilities could materially increase. the epa has also adopted rules that bring remote tributaries into the regulatory definition of waters of the united states that are protected by the clean water act, thereby imposing significant additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land uses, and is in many ways aggressively attempting to expand its regulatory authority over air quality, water quality and solid wastes, among other things. these rules are being litigated by multiple parties. regulations are also being considered at various governmental levels to increase federal financial responsibility requirements both for mine closure and reclamation and for oil and gas decommissioning, and to increase regulation of or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs, threaten certain operating activities and constrain our expansion opportunities. in february 2016, the department of the interior's fish &amp; wildlife service (fws) adopted final rules that broaden the regulatory definitions of "critical habitat" and "destruction or adverse modification," both of which are integral to the fws's implementation of the endangered species act, which protects federally-listed endangered and threatened species. the new rules increase fws's discretion to limit uses of land and water courses that may become suitable habitat for listed species in the future, or that are occasionally used by protected species. the new rules may limit the ability of landowners, including us, to obtain federal permits or authorizations needed for expansion of our operations, and may also affect our ability to obtain, retain or deliver water to some operations. we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations totaling $0.4 billion in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. for 2017 , we expect to incur approximately $0.6 billion of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs, which includes expenditures for the miami smelter pollution control equipment discussed above. the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs on continuing matters. 50 table of contents we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on properties that have not been operated in many years. fmc and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies, have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the u.s. for more than a century. activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment. with the passage of cercla in 1980, companies like fmc became legally responsible for remediating hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them as well as properties where they arranged for disposal of such substances, irrespective of when the release to the environment occurred or who caused it. that liability is often asserted on a joint and several basis with other prior and subsequent owners, operators and arrangers, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is, and each arranger may be, held fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other responsible parties no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. as a result, because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are potentially responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the u.s., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. at december 31, 2016 , we had more than 100 active remediation projects in 26 u.s. states. in addition, fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties that contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and from time to time these provisions become the source of claims against us. at december 31, 2016 , we had $1.2 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of operating facilities. our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon: our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago; our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates. significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material. in addition, remediation standards imposed by the epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become even more stringent in the future. imposition of more stringent remediation standards, particularly for arsenic and lead in soils, poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at our active remediation sites and at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation. refer to note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations. our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs. mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the 51 table of contents ore that we mine. our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands. another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. in the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. in addition, overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailings management area; this additional material, while predicted in our environmental studies, influences the deposition of finer tailings material in the estuary. from time to time, certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition. because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations. carbon-based energy is a significant input in our operations, and our revenues include sales of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, and other carbon-based energy products. the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. as a result of the paris agreement reached during the 21 st conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in 2015, a number of governments have pledged "nationally determined contributions" to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. in the u.s., epa has finalized regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing power plants. while these rules are being challenged in court, increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs. other risks our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ' ability to receive dividends . we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock and intercompany receivables of our subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. cash at our international operations is also typically subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the u.s. in addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to us or repay loans to us, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit agreements that restrict their ability to make distributions or loan repayments to us if such subsidiary is in default under such agreements, to repay any subordinated loan we may make to such subsidiary unless specified conditions are met, or to transfer substantially all of the assets of such subsidiary without the consent of the lenders. our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors. 52 table of contents anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. these provisions: authorize the board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us; establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings; limit who may call stockholder meetings; and require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price. these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board. in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us. these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.
