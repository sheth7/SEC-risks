pumped to the candelaria tailings facility for final deposition. the candelaria facility has sufficient capacity for the remaining ojos del salado tailings. ojos del salado's production totaled 52 million pounds of copper and 14 thousand ounces of gold in 2013 , 53 million pounds of copper and 14 thousand ounces of gold in 2012 , and 58 million pounds of copper and 16 thousand ounces of gold in 2011 . ojos del salado is located in a desert environment with rainfall averaging less than one inch per year and is in an active seismic zone. the highest underground level is at an elevation of 530 meters above sea level, with the lowest underground level at 40 meters above sea level. the ojos del salado mineral rights encompass approximately 15,800 acres, which includes 6,800 acres of owned land in and around the ojos del salado underground mines and plant site. ojos del salado receives electrical power through long-term contracts with aes gener s.a. ojos del salado's water supply comes from a nearby wastewater treatment facility and our desalination plant and pipeline that was completed in 2013. we believe that both of these sources will supply ojos del salado's long term water needs. 17 table of contents indonesia ownership . pt-fi is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the republic of indonesia and incorporated in delaware. we directly own 81.28 percent of the outstanding common stock of pt-fi and indirectly own 9.36 percent through our wholly owned subsidiary, pt indocopper investama; the indonesian government owns the remaining 9.36 percent. we have established certain unincorporated joint ventures with rio tinto plc (rio tinto), under which rio tinto has a 40 percent interest in certain assets and future production exceeding specified annual amounts of copper, gold and silver. refer to note 3 for further discussion of our joint ventures with rio tinto. we also conducted exploration activities in papua, indonesia through two other entities: pt nabire bakti mining (ptnbm) and pt irja eastern minerals (eastern minerals), of which we own 100 percent. as further discussed below, we have begun the process to terminate the contracts of work (cow) for ptnbm and eastern minerals and to return the exploration areas to the indonesian government. contracts of work . pt-fi conducts its current exploration and mining operations in indonesia through a cow with the indonesian government. the cow governs our rights and obligations relating to taxes, exchange controls, royalties, repatriation and other matters, and was concluded pursuant to the 1967 foreign capital investment law, which expresses indonesia's foreign investment policy and provides basic guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization, a framework for economic incentives and basic rules regarding other rights and obligations of foreign investors. specifically, the cow provides that the indonesian government will not nationalize or expropriate pt-fi's mining operations. any disputes regarding the provisions of the cow are subject to international arbitration; however, we have not had an arbitration during the more than 40 years we have operated in indonesia. pt-fi's original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by a new cow in 1991. the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021, but can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. the cow allows us to conduct exploration, mining and production activities in the 24,700-acre block a area, which is where all of pt-fi's proven and probable mineral reserves and current mining operations are located. under the cow, pt-fi also conducts exploration activities in the block b area. we expect the block b area to be reduced to approximately 413,000 acres once the department of energy and mineral resources (demr) formally accepts pt-fi's relinquishment of approximately 89,000 acres, and further relinquishments may result from the cow evaluation process discussed in note 13 . 18 table of contents pt-fi pays royalties on copper, gold and silver under its cow, and has agreed to pay additional royalties to the indonesian government that are not required under its cow. the additional royalties provide further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua. pt-fi's share of the combined royalties totaled $109 million in 2013 , $93 million in 2012 and $137 million in 2011 . under a joint venture agreement through ptnbm, we were allowed to conduct exploration activities under a separate cow on three parcels contiguous to pt-fi's block b and one of eastern minerals' blocks. since 2011, we have made a number of requests of the demr, including suspension of activities for the cow, while awaiting receipt of permits from the indonesian government's department of forestry that would allow us to resume exploration activities. in september 2013, we received notification from the demr advising us to lodge a completed feasibility study within 30 days and enter into the construction period within the cow timeline. however, since we had not completed our exploration program, we were unable to comply. the letter was in effect, a denial of our previously unanswered requests, resulting in a decision to terminate the cow. we have initiated actions required under the cow that will result in its formal termination. eastern minerals is allowed to conduct exploration in papua through a joint venture agreement under a separate cow. the situation with the eastern minerals cow is similar to that of ptnbm, and we expect to receive a similar response from the demr. because of this expected outcome, we have notified the demr of our intentions to terminate the cow and have initiated the formal termination process. in 2009, indonesia enacted a mining law (2009 mining law), which operates under a licensing system that is significantly less protective of licensees than the contract of work system that governs pt-fi, eastern minerals and ptnbm. the 2009 mining law and the regulations issued pursuant to that law provide that contracts of work would continue to be honored until their expiration. however, the regulations, including those issued in january 2014, attempt to apply certain provisions of the 2009 mining law and regulations to existing contracts of work and seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work. in january 2012, the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team of ministers to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and to take steps to assess and determine the indonesian government's position on reduction to the size of contract concessions, increasing government revenues and domestic processing of minerals. we have been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government to complete this evaluation process and obtain an extension of the pt-fi cow beyond its primary term ending in 2021 to 2041, as provided under the terms of the cow, which can only be modified by mutual agreement between pt-fi and the indonesian government. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion. in january 2014, the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12, 2017, but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates, including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates in the amount of 25 percent in 2014, rising to 60 percent by mid-2016. pt-fi's cow authorizes it to export concentrates and specifies the taxes and other fiscal terms available to its operations. the cow states that pt-fi shall not be subject to taxes, duties or fees subsequently imposed or approved by the indonesian government except as expressly provided in the cow. additionally, pt-fi complied with the requirements of its cow for local processing by arranging for the construction and commissioning of indonesia's only copper smelter and refinery, which is owned and operated by pt smelting (refer to "smelting facilities and other mining properties"). the january 2014 regulations conflict with pt-fi's contractual rights under its cow. we are working with the indonesian government to clarify the situation and to defend pt-fi's rights under its cow. pt-fi is also seeking to obtain the required administrative permits for 2014 exports, which have been delayed as a result of the new regulations. as of february 21, 2014, pt-fi has not obtained administrative approval for 2014 exports. pt-fi has implemented near-term changes to its operations to coordinate its concentrate production with pt smelting's operating plans. since mid-january 2014, pt-fi's milling rate has averaged approximately 112,000 metric tons of ore per day, which is approximately half of normal rates. pt-fi is engaging with the government of indonesia to reach a resolution that would enable pt-fi to resume normal operations as soon as possible. in the event that pt-fi is unable to resume normal operations for an extended period, we plan to consider further actions, including constraining operating 19 table of contents costs, deferring capital expenditures and implementing workforce reductions. pt-fi may also be required to declare force majeure under its concentrate sales agreements. grasberg minerals district . pt-fi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua, indonesia, which is on the western half of the island of new guinea. we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967. the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines: the grasberg open pit, the deep ore zone (doz) underground mine and the big gossan underground mine. we also have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit. in aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to produce approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day following the transition from the grasberg open pit, currently anticipated to occur in 2017. refer to mining development projects and exploration for further discussion. pt-fi's production, including our joint venture partner's share, totaled 928 million pounds of copper and 1.14 million ounces of gold in 2013 , 695 million pounds of copper and 862 thousand ounces of gold in 2012 and 882 million pounds of copper and 1.44 million ounces of gold in 2011 . our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coal-fired power plant that we built in 1998. diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity. a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations. our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches. grasberg open pit we began open-pit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990, with mining operations expected to continue through early 2017. production in the open pit is currently at the 3,190- to 3,940- meter elevation level and totaled 46 million metric tons of ore in 2013 , which provided 71 percent of pt-fi's 2013 mill feed. the current open-pit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units. the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 157 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 330 metric tons and 16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 to 42 cubic meters, which mined an average of 381,000 metric tons of material per day during 2013 , 399,000 metric tons per day in 2012 and 486,000 metric tons per day in 2011 . grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 250,000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 150,000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles. the remaining overburden is moved by haul trucks. doz underground mine the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone. we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods, but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit. production resumed in september 2000 using the block-cave method and is at the 3,110-meter elevation level. production from the doz mine averaged 49,400 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2013 and is expected to ramp up to the design rate of 80,000 metric tons of ore per day during 2014 pending approval of export permits as described above. production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2019. the doz mine fleet consists of over 200 pieces of mobile heavy equipment, which is capable of mining an average of 80,000 metric tons of material per day. the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 44 lhd units and 20 haul trucks. each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore. using ore passes and chutes, the lhd units transfer ore into 55-metric ton capacity haul trucks. the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing. the success of the development of the doz mine, one of the world's largest underground mines, provides confidence in the future development of pt-fi's large-scale undeveloped underground ore bodies. 20 table of contents big gossan underground mine the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site. it is a tabular, near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1,200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters. the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill. stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level. trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher. the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two-skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt. the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing. the big gossan underground mine averaged 2,100 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2013 and is expected to ramp up to 7,000 metric tons of ore per day by 2016. although development activities continue, production from the big gossan underground mine is currently suspended pending resolution of the export regulatory matter discussed above. the big gossan underground mine fleet consists of over 70 pieces of mobile heavy equipment, which includes 11 loaders and eight trucks used in development and production activities. description of ore bodies . our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite. the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them. the igneous-hosted ore bodies (the grasberg open pit and block cave, and portions of the doz block cave) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides, dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a lesser extent, bornite. the sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies (portions of the doz and all of the big gossan) occur as magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn replacements, whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions. the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite concentrations are common. moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district's ore bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals, though, in some deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite. the following diagram indicates the relative elevations (in meters) of our reported ore bodies. 21 table of contents the following map, which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers (approximately 16 square miles), indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported indonesia ore bodies and their locations. africa tfm is organized under the laws of the drc. we own an effective 56 percent interest in tfm, with the remaining ownership interests held by lundin mining corporation (lundin) (an effective 24 percent interest) and la g n rale des carri res et des mines (g camines), which is wholly owned by the drc government (a 20 percent non-dilutable interest). tfm is entitled to mine in the drc under an amended and restated mining convention (armc) with the drc government. the original mining convention was entered into in 1996 and was replaced with the armc in 2005, which was further amended in 2010 (approved in 2011). the current armc will remain in effect for as long as the tenke concessions are exploitable. tfm pays a royalty of two percent of net revenues under the armc, which totaled $29 million in 2013 , $25 million in 2012 and $24 million in 2011 . 22 table of contents the tenke minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi and is accessible by paved roads and by rail. the deposits are sediment-hosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide and sulfide mineralization. the dominant oxide minerals are malachite, pseudomalachite and heterogenite. important sulfide minerals consist of bornite, carrollite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite. initial copper production commenced at the tenke minerals district in march 2009. tfm completed its second phase expansion project in early 2013, which included optimizing the current plant and increasing mine, mill and processing capacity. the expanded mill facility throughput rates averaged 14,900 metric tons of ore per day during 2013, compared with original design capacity of 14,000 metric tons of ore per day, enabling an increase in tenke's copper production to over 430 million pounds per year. the addition of a second sulphuric acid plant is expected to be completed in 2016. we continue to engage in exploration activities and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective tenke minerals district. these analyses are being incorporated into future plans for potential expansions of production capacity. future expansions are subject to a number of factors, including economic and market conditions and the business and investment climate in the drc. the current equipment fleet includes one 10-cubic meter mass excavator, three 17-cubic meter mass excavators, three 12-cubic meter front-end loaders, ten 7-cubic meter front-end loaders, thirty-two 91-metric ton haul trucks and eleven 45-metric ton haul trucks. copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitation-leach plant. production from the tenke minerals district totaled 462 million pounds of copper and 28 million pounds of cobalt in 2013 , 348 million pounds of copper and 26 million pounds of cobalt in 2012 and 281 million pounds of copper and 25 million pounds of cobalt in 2011 . the tenke minerals district is located in a tropical region; however, temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes. weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season, each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year. the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1,518 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1,110 meters above sea level. the tenke deposits are covered by six exploitation permits totaling approximately 394,450 acres. tfm has long-term power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la soci t nationale d'electricit , the state-owned electric utility company serving the region. the results of a recent water exploration program, as well as the regional geological and hydro-geological conditions, indicate that adequate water is available during the expected life of the operation. smelting facilities and other mining properties atlantic copper . our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva, spain, port authorities, which are scheduled to expire in 2027. the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300,000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 285,000 metric tons of copper per year. during 2013 , atlantic copper treated approximately 869,400 million metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 224,300 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 226,000 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery. following is a summary of atlantic copper's concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties for the last three years: 2013 2012 2011 north america copper mines 13 % 16 % 2 % south america mining 32 % 31 % 30 % indonesia mining 16 % 10 % 17 % third parties 39 % 43 % 51 % 100 % 100 % 100 % during 2013, atlantic copper successfully completed a scheduled 68-day major maintenance turnaround. atlantic copper's major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. the next short-term maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the second half of 2015. 23 table of contents pt smelting . pt-fi's cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable. in 1995, following the completion of a feasibility study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting, an indonesian company, and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik, indonesia. pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery. pt-fi, mitsubishi materials corporation, mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd. and jx nippon mining &amp; metals corporation own 25 percent, 60.5 percent, 9.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the outstanding pt smelting common stock. pt-fi's contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements (subject to a minimum or maximum rate) necessary for pt smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. pt-fi also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting (at market rates) for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. during 2013 , pt smelting treated 967,800 metric tons of concentrate and produced 217,700 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 214,300 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery. pt smelting's maintenance turnarounds (which range from two weeks to a month to complete) typically are expected to occur approximately every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. pt smelting completed an 18-day maintenance turnaround during first-quarter 2014, and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2016. miami smelter . we own and operate a smelter at our miami, arizona, mining operation. the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies, to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements. as a result of new air quality standards for sulfur dioxide emissions, the miami smelter is required to install pollution control equipment as part of an expansion that will allow the smelter to operate and comply with the new standard (refer to item 1a. risk factors for further discussion). the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our arizona copper mines. concentrate processed through the smelter totaled approximately 629,000 metric tons in 2013 . in addition, because sulphuric acid is a by-product of smelting concentrates, the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations. major maintenance turnarounds (which take approximately three weeks to complete) typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter, with shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. rod &amp; refining operations . our rod &amp; refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america, including a refinery in el paso, texas; rod mills in el paso, texas, norwich, connecticut, and miami, arizona; and a specialty copper products facility in bayway, new jersey. we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery. the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode, which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at miami. our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate, copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold, silver, platinum and palladium. molybdenum conversion facilities . we process molybdenum concentrates at our conversion plants in the u.s. and europe into such products as technical-grade molybdic oxide, ferromolybdenum, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide. we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita, arizona; fort madison, iowa; and rotterdam, the netherlands, and we operate a molybdenum pressure leach plant in bagdad, arizona. we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket, united kingdom. freeport cobalt . on march 29, 2013, we, through a newly formed consolidated joint venture, completed the acquisition of a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola, finland, and the related sales and marketing business. the acquisition provides direct end-market access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke minerals district. the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt, and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest. the remaining effective ownership interest is held by our partners in tfm, including 24 percent by lundin and 20 percent by g camines. the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 12,000 metric tons of cobalt, sufficient to refine the majority of the cobalt we produce in the tenke minerals district. 24 table of contents other north america copper mines . in addition to our operating mines, we have four non-operating copper mines in north america ajo, bisbee and tohono in arizona, and cobre in new mexico that have been on care-and-maintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies, new permits, and additional capital investment, which could be significant, to return them to operating status. in december 2009, we purchased the twin buttes copper mine, which ceased operations in 1994 and is adjacent to our sierrita mine in arizona. the purchase provides significant synergies in the sierrita minerals district, including the potential for expanded mining activities and access to material that can be used for sierrita tailings and stockpile reclamation purposes. we have completed drilling on the property and metallurgical studies to support a future feasibility study. mining development projects and exploration we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies. our near-term major development projects, which will require substantial additional capital investment, are presented below. also refer to md&amp;a for further discussion of these projects, our other development projects and exploration activities. considering the long-term nature and large size of our development projects, actual costs and timing could vary from estimates. we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves. morenci . we are expanding mining and milling capacity at morenci to process additional sulfide ores identified through exploratory drilling. the project is targeting incremental annual production of approximately 225 million pounds of copper beginning in 2014 (an approximate 40 percent increase from 2013) through an increase in milling rates from 50,000 metric tons of ore per day to approximately 115,000 metric tons of ore per day. at full rates, morenci's copper production is expected to approach 1 billion pounds in 2015 compared with 564 million pounds in 2013. at december 31, 2013, construction is more than 60 percent complete and the project is on track for first copper production in the first half of 2014. cerro verde . construction activities associated with a large-scale expansion at cerro verde are in progress. at december 31, 2013, engineering was more than 90 percent complete and construction progress is advancing on schedule. the project is expected to expand the concentrator facilities from 120,000 metric tons of ore per day to 360,000 metric tons of ore per day and provide incremental annual production of approximately 600 million pounds of copper and 15 million pounds of molybdenum beginning in 2016. in addition, construction activities are progressing on a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa, which will be used to supplement existing water supplies to support the concentrator expansion. el abra . we continue to evaluate a potential large-scale milling operation at el abra to process additional sulfide material and to achieve higher recoveries. exploration results in recent years at el abra indicate a significant sulfide resource, which could potentially support a major mill project. grasberg . we have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies. in aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to produce approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day following the transition from the grasberg open pit, currently anticipated to occur in 2017. development of the grasberg block cave and deep mill level zone (dmlz) mines is advancing to enable dmlz to commence production in 2015 and the grasberg block cave mine to commence production in 2017. in addition to the near-term development projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district, we also have an additional long-term underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body, which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2,605-meter elevation level. we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the block-cave method; aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate $2 billion (which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2032). additionally, our current mine development plans include approximately $3 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg open-pit operations cease (we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be m ade between 2016 and 2034). 25 table of contents sources and availability of energy, natural resources and raw materials our copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. energy represented approximately 20 percent of our 2013 consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 260 million gallons of diesel fuel; 7,200 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america, south america and africa copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation); 705 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia; and 1 mmbtu (million british thermal units) of natural gas at certain of our north america mines. for 2014 , we estimate energy will approximate 21 percent of our consolidated copper production costs. our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights, the loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations. for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water, refer to item 1a. risk factors and item 3. legal proceedings. sulphuric acid is used in the sx/ew process and is produced as a by-product of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burners at the safford and tenke mines. sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties. community and human rights we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects basic human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations. we continue to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs, which include: comprehensive job training programs basic education programs public health programs, including malaria control and hiv testing agricultural assistance programs small and medium enterprise development programs cultural promotion and preservation programs clean water and sanitation projects community infrastructure development charitable donations in december 2000, we endorsed the joint u.s. state department-british foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security (voluntary principles). we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resources companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy and site level projects. we also are currently integrating the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our human rights program by conducting a corporate level human rights impact assessment. the results of this assessment will be used to evaluate and help direct our human rights program going forward, including a review of our human rights policy. we also participate in a multi-industry human rights working group to help us learn from peer companies and determine the best way to integrate human rights due diligence into our business practices and to support our voluntary principles program. we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations. as part of our ongoing, annual commitment to sustainable community development, we have made significant investments in social programs, including in-kind support and administration, across our global operations. over the last three years, these investments have averaged $179 million per year. nevertheless, social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations. refer to item 1a. risk factors for further discussion. south america . cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years. following engagements with regional and local governments, civic leaders and development agencies, in 2006, cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa. in addition, an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage and distribution network, which was 26 table of contents financed by the cerro verde civil association (the association). the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education, training, health, cultural preservation and basic infrastructure. cerro verde has also reached agreement with the regional government of arequipa, the national government, sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance, engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa (refer to md&amp;a for further discussion). treating this water will improve the rio chili's water quality, enhance agriculture products grown in the area and reduce waterborne illnesses. indonesia . in 1996, pt-fi established the freeport partnership fund for community development (the partnership fund), through which pt-fi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education and economic development of the area. pt-fi has committed through 2016 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund. our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled $41 million in 2013 , $39 million in 2012 and $50 million in 2011 . the amungme and kamoro community development organization ( lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or lpmak) oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund. lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors, which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities, government leaders, church leaders, and one representative of pt-fi on each board. the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations. security matters . consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property, we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. as part of its security program, pt-fi maintains its own internal security department, which is unarmed and performs functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring shipments of supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. the security department has received human rights training and each member is required to certify his or her compliance with our human rights policy. pt-fi's share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $51 million for 2013 , $52 million for 2012 and $37 million for 2011 . pt-fi, and all businesses and residents of indonesia, rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia's vital national assets. this designation results in the police, and to a lesser extent, the military, playing a significant role in protecting the area of our operations. the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations. from the outset of pt-fi's operations, the indonesian government has looked to pt-fi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua. pt-fi's financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged, and have the logistical resources to patrol pt-fi's roads and secure its operating area. in addition, the provision of such support is consistent with pt-fi's obligations under the cow, reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship, and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights. pt-fi's share of support costs for the government-provided security was $25 million in 2013 , $22 million in 2012 and $14 million in 2011 . this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion of security risks in indonesia. africa . tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc. initiatives include an integrated malaria control program, construction, renovation and building of local health facilities, construction and renovation of local schools, installation of over 90 clean water wells in rural villages as well as construction of urban water distribution systems, and economic development programs supporting 27 table of contents development and training of local entrepreneurs, contractors and farmers. we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country, including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems. through the amended and restated mining convention, tfm has also committed to contribute 0.3 percent of net sales revenue from production to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services including health, education and agriculture. the tfm social community fund is managed by a board of directors comprised of two local community representatives, one representative nominated by the provincial governor and four tfm representatives. a community stakeholder forum comprised of 40 community representatives provides for increased community participation and input regarding project priorities, community needs, and transparency of fund management. the tfm social community fund contributions totaled $4 million in each of the years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . security matters . tfm maintains an unarmed internal security department. the national government also has assigned mines police to the tfm concession area. the mines police are a division of the congolese national police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the drc. tfm provides food, housing, monetary allowances and logistical support as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area. the total cost to tfm for this support, including in-kind support, totaled less than $1 million in each of the years 2013 , 2012 and 2011 . tfm also participates in monthly security coordination meetings with host country security personnel, other mining companies, and representatives from the united nations to discuss security issues and concerns. as an outcome of the coordination meetings, tfm has partnered with monusco (united nations stabilization mission in the drc) to conduct human rights training in the tfm concession for host government security personnel, local representatives and tfm security employees. 28 table of contents mining production data years ended december 31, (fcx's net interest in %) 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 copper (millions of recoverable pounds) north america

reserves from our mining operations summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31, 2013 , in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934. proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries. proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. the term reserve, as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. the term proven reserves means mineral reserves for which (1) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (2) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (3) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. the term probable reserves means mineral reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. the degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees; a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination. estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at december 31, 2013 , were determined using long-term average prices of $2.00 per pound for copper (consistent with the long-term average copper price used since december 31, 2010), $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. for the three-year period ended december 31, 2013 , lme spot copper prices averaged $3.64 per pound, london pm gold prices averaged $1,550 per ounce, and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged $12.85 per pound. the recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. recoverable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves estimated at december 31, 2013 copper a (billion pounds) gold (million ounces) molybdenum (billion pounds) silver b

calculated by reference to its proven and probable reserves as of december 31, 1994, and 60 percent of all remaining cash flow. 34 table of contents in defining our open-pit reserves, we apply a variable cutoff grade strategy. the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations. we use a "break-even cutoff grade" to define the in-situ reserves for our underground ore bodies. the break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production. our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals, such as gold, molybdenum, silver and cobalt. we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade. copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal. the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade. the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december 31, 2013 : copper

professionals, such as geologists and geological engineers, in determining the suitability of data coverage (on a relative basis) in a given deposit type and mining method scenario so as to achieve a given level of confidence in the resource estimate. drill hole spacing is only one of several criteria necessary to establish resource classification. drilling programs are typically designed to achieve an optimum sample spacing to support the level of confidence in results that apply to a particular stage of development of a mineral deposit. the following table sets forth the average drill

probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body. the chart also shows the term of pt-fi's cow. production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life. the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors, including the results of our exploration and development efforts, and may vary from the dates shown below. in addition, we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies. significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the life-of-mine plans reflected below. mill and leach stockpiles mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from the ore body and are available for copper recovery. for mill stockpiles, recovery is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. for leach stockpiles, recovery is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities. because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. 37 table of contents expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production-scale process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. for newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. processes and recovery rates are monitored continuously, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31, 2013 : recoverable million average recovery copper metric tons ore grade (%) rate (%) (billion pounds) mill stockpiles cerro

contents oil and gas operations as further discussed in note 2, during second-quarter 2013, we acquired oil and gas operations by completing the acquisitions of pxp and mmr. our oil and gas operations include oil production facilities and growth potential in the deepwater gom, oil production from the onshore eagle ford shale play in texas, oil production facilities onshore and offshore california, onshore natural gas resources in the haynesville shale play in louisiana, natural gas production from the madden area in central wyoming, and an industry-leading position in the emerging shallow-water inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous natural gas trend on the shelf of the gom and onshore in south louisiana. refer to "general" for a map showing the locations of our oil and gas operations. acreage at december 31, 2013, we owned interests in approximately 45 thousand oil and gas leases covering 5.1 million gross acres (2.8 million acres net to our interest). the following table summarizes, by

acreage is expected to be retained by drilling operations or other means. the lease for our morocco acreage expires in 2016; however, we have the ability to extend the lease through 2019. oil and gas properties our oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions. we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with our use of the properties in the operation of our business. we believe that we have satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties. as is customary in the oil and gas industry, we make minimal investigation of title at the time we acquire undeveloped properties. we make title investigations and receive title opinions of local counsel only before we commence drilling operations. we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets. although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases, we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use in the operation of our business. following are descriptions of our primary u.s. oil and gas properties: gulf of mexico . deepwater gom. our deepwater gom portfolio includes a 100 percent working interest in the holstein, horn mountain, marlin, dorado and king fields, a 31 percent working interest in the ram powell field and a 33.3 percent working interest in the diana and hoover fields. 40 table of contents the following table summarizes our deepwater gom platforms at december 31, 2013: capacity per day platform field location type of platform production commenced

marlin field (s/2 viosca knoll block 871 and n/2 viosca knoll block 915), the dorado field (s/2 viosca knoll block 915) and the king field (mississippi canyon blocks 84, 85, 128 and 129). the marlin field currently produces via a combination of platform and subsea tie-back wells while the dorado and king fields currently produce exclusively via subsea wells and tie-back infrastructure. c. the hoover platform is a deep draft caisson vessel located in alaminos canyon block 25. the diana field is located in east breaks blocks 945, 946 and 989, and the hoover field is located in alaminos canyon blocks 25 and 26. additionally, our subsidiary plains offshore operations inc. (plains offshore), holds a 23.33 percent working interest in the lucius oil field and a 50 percent working interest in the phobos discovery. refer to note 2 for further discussion of plains offshore. our deepwater gom exploration portfolio includes interests in 147 blocks containing 60 prospects in the pliocene, miocene and lower tertiary reservoirs. gom shelf. our gom shelf properties are primarily located on the outer continental shelf in the shallow waters (less than 500 feet of water) of the gom and onshore in the gulf coast area of louisiana, with drilling depths not exceeding 15,000 feet considered to be traditional shelf prospects. inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous. prospects with drilling depths below the salt weld (generally at depths exceeding 25,000 feet) are considered inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous prospects. refer to "exploration and development activities" for further discussion. eagle ford . the eagle ford shale play is upper cretaceous in age, and typical well depths range from 9,500 feet to 11,500 feet. the area is currently being developed with horizontal wells with lateral lengths ranging from 3,500 feet to 6,000 feet at a measured total depth from 14,500 to 17,500 feet. we own approximately 392 square miles of 3-d seismic data on our acreage. based on the 60 to 130 acre well spacing, we anticipate over 600 potential well locations, with approximately 250 locations remaining. california . onshore california. we hold a 100 percent working interest in the majority of our los angeles basin properties in the inglewood, las cienegas, montebello, packard and san vicente fields, and a 100 percent working interest in the majority of our san joaquin basin properties in the cymric, midway sunset and south belridge fields. the los angeles basin properties are characterized by light crude oil (21 to 32 degree american petroleum institute (api) gravity), have well depths ranging from 2,000 feet to over 10,000 feet and include both primary production and mature wells using waterflood recovery methods (whereby water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil), where producing wells have a high ratio of water produced compared to total liquids produced (high water cuts). the san joaquin basin properties are long-lived fields that have heavier oil (12 to 16 degree api gravity) and shallow wells (generally less than 2,000 feet) that require enhanced oil recovery techniques, including steam injection, and produce with high water cuts. 41 table of contents we also hold a 100 percent working interest (94 percent net revenue interest) in the arroyo grande field located in san luis obispo county, which is a long-lived field that has heavier oil (12 to 16 degree api gravity) and well depths averaging 1,700 feet requiring continuous steam injection. offshore california. all of our offshore california properties are located in federal waters approximately five to seven miles offshore in the santa maria basin. we hold a 69.3 percent working interest (58 perecent net revenue interest) in the point arguello unit, composed of the hidalgo, hermosa and harvest platforms, and the various partnerships owning the related transportation, processing and marketing infrastructure. we also hold a 100 percent working interest (83 percent net revenue interest) in the point pedernales field, which includes the irene platform, that is utilized to access the federal outer continental shelf monterey reservoir by extended reach directional wells and support facilities which lie within the onshore lompoc field. haynesville . the haynesville shale play is characterized by gas production from the jurassic aged haynesville shale formation in louisiana, and typical well depth is 10,500 feet. the area has historically been developed with approximately 4,000 foot horizontal wells at a measured total depth of 16,000 feet. madden . we own an approximate 14 percent working interest in the madden deep unit and lost cabin gas plant located in central wyoming. the madden deep unit is a federal unit operated by a third party and consists of acreage in the wind river basin. the madden area is characterized by gas production from multiple stratigraphic horizons of the lower fort union, lance, mesaverde and cody sands and the madison dolomite. production from the madden deep unit is typically found at depths ranging from 5,500 to 25,000 feet. exploration and development activities our oil and gas business has significant proved, probable and possible reserves with financially attractive organic growth opportunities. the portfolio includes a broad range of development opportunities and high-potential exploration prospects. substantial capital expenditures will continue to be required for our oil and gas exploration and development activities, which are expected to be funded by oil and gas operating cash flows and proceeds from asset sales. also refer to md&amp;a for further discussion of our oil and gas exploration, operating and development activities. gulf of mexico . multiple development and exploration opportunities have been identified in the deepwater gom that are expected to benefit from tie-back opportunities to available production capacity at the fm o&amp;g operated large-scale holstein, marlin and horn mountain deepwater production platforms. holstein, in which we have a 100 percent working interest, is located in green canyon and has production facilities capable of producing in excess of 100 thousand barrels of oil equivalents (mboe) per day. the holstein platform rig refurbishment program was conducted in the second half of 2013 in preparation for drilling and workover activity, which commenced in first-quarter 2014. over the 2014 to 2016 period, we expect to drill seven sidetrack wells from the holstein platform and five subsea tie-back wells from contracted drill ships to enhance production volumes from the spar. near-term tie-back prospects in the holstein area include holstein deep and copper. the holstein deep development, in which we have a 100 percent working interest, is located four miles west of the holstein platform. fm o&amp;g acquired the acreage associated with this development in the 2013 lease sale held by the bureau of ocean energy management. two successful wells had previously been drilled and encountered approximately 500 net feet of oil pay in recent years. we plan to delineate this prospect during 2014. the copper exploration prospect, in which we have a 100 percent working interest, is located southeast of the holstein field in 4,400 feet of water and is a subsea tie-back opportunity to the holstein facility. the prospect is a holstein analog play with pliocene objectives and has a proposed total depth of 14,500 feet. development of the lucius field in keathley canyon, in which our subsidiary plains offshore has a 23.33 percent working interest, is progressing with first production anticipated in the second half of 2014. the geologic results from the six wells drilled since 2009 confirm a significant oil resource. subsea infrastructure is currently being installed, and topside facilities are more than 90 percent complete and on schedule to be delivered and lifted into place during 2014. the sanctioned development of lucius is a subsea development consisting of a truss spar hull located in 7,200 feet of water with a topside capacity of 80 thousand barrels (mbbls) of oil per day and 450 million cubic feet (mmcf) of gas per day. 42 table of contents during 2014, plains offshore also plans to commence drilling at the tara exploration prospect, in which we have a 100 percent working interest, located northwest of the lucius discovery in keathley canyon in 8,700 feet of water. tara is a lucius analog prospect with pliocene/miocene objectives and has a proposed total depth of 23,000 feet. eagle ford . we have an attractive position in an oil- and ngl-rich section of the eagle ford shale play in south texas. production from the field has grown significantly in recent years and sales averaged 46 mboe per day for the seven-month period following the acquisition of our oil and gas operations in 2013. as part of our capital spending reduction initiatives, we have reduced drilling activity at eagle ford from eight rigs in mid-2013. at december 31, 2013 , there were three drilling rigs operating, which we expect to reduce to two during 2014. at december 31, 2013 , there were 36 wells that were drilling or were drilled and pending completion or connection to pipelines. california . development plans are principally focused on maintaining stable production levels in the long established producing fields onshore california through continued drilling. haynesville . we have rights to a substantial natural gas resource, located in the haynesville shale play in north louisiana. drilling activities in recent years have been significantly reduced to maximize cash flows in a low natural gas price environment and to benefit from potentially higher future natural gas prices. inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous . we have an industry leading position in the emerging shallow-water inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous natural gas trend, located on the shelf of the gom and onshore south louisiana. we have a significant onshore and offshore lease acreage position with high-quality prospects and the potential to develop a significant long-term, low-cost source of natural gas. data from eight wells drilled to date indicate the presence of geologic formations that are analogous to productive formations in the deepwater gom and onshore in the gulf coast region. the near-term focus is on defining the trend onshore. we are currently completing two inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous exploration prospects, including one onshore well, and plan to perform production tests on these two wells and a third well in 2014. the lomond north discovery well within the highlander area, in which we are the operator and have a 72 percent working interest, located in st. martin parish, louisiana, has encountered gas pay in several wilcox and cretaceous aged sands between 24,000 feet and 29,000 feet. the wireline log and core data obtained from the wilcox and cretaceous sand packages indicated favorable reservoir characteristics with approximately 150 feet of net pay. the lomond north discovery well is currently in completion operations to test lower wilcox and cretaceous objectives found below the salt weld. we have identified multiple exploratory prospects in the highlander area where we control rights to approximately 56,000 gross acres. during 2013 , we commenced completion operations at davy jones no. 2, in which we have a 75 percent working interest, located on south marsh island block 234. flow testing is anticipated in the first half of 2014. during 2014, we also plan to complete the blackbeard west no. 2 well, in which we have a 92 percent working interest, located on ship shoal block 188. the lineham creek exploration well, in which we have a 36 percent working interest, located in cameron parish has been suspended while future plans are being developed. future production from certain specified inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous exploration prospects is subject to a five percent overriding royalty interest held by gulf coast ultra deep royalty trust. the overriding royalty interest is proportionately reduced based on our working interest in each prospect as provided in the trust documents. at december 31, 2013, we beneficially owned 27 percent of the royalty trust. refer to note 2 for further discussion of the royalty trust. morocco . we have a commitment to fund and drill two wells offshore the kingdom of morocco. we expect to commence drilling of the first exploration well in early 2015. 43 table of contents production and sales data the following table presents summary production data, average realized prices and average production costs for our oil and gas operations for the seven-month period in 2013 following the acquisition dates. seven-month period june 1,

reconciliation to production and delivery costs reported in our consolidated financial statements. oil and natural gas reserves our reserve volumes have been determined in accordance with the current regulations and guidelines established by the sec, which require the use of an average price, calculated as the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference price as adjusted for location and quality differentials, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions and the impact of derivatives. reference prices for reserve determination are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas. at december 31, 2013, our estimates were based on reference prices of $96.94 per barrel and $3.67 per mmbtu. all of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in the u.s. proved reserves. all of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at december 31, 2013, are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. (nsai) and ryder scott company, l.p. (ryder scott). the scope and results of procedures employed by nsai and ryder scott are summarized in letters that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. for purposes of reserve estimation, we and our independent petroleum engineers used technical and economic data including well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. our reserves have been estimated using deterministic methods. standard engineering and geoscience methods were used, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy, which we and our independent petroleum engineers considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with sec definitions and regulations. a substantial portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations; such reserves are based on estimates of reserve volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover. 44 proved reserves represent quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. at december 31, 2013, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled 464 mmboe, of which 80 percent was comprised of oil (including ngls). proved oil and natural gas reserves estimated at december 31, 2013 oil a natural gas total (mmbbls) (bcf) (mmboe) proved developed: gulf of mexico 73 125 94 eagle ford 36 41 43 california 126 29 131 haynesville/madden/other 1 228 39 236

proved reserves, consisting of 14 mmbbls of proved developed and 6 mmbbls of proved undeveloped. at december 31, 2013 , we have an estimated total proved reserve life of seven years and a proved developed reserve life of 4.6 years. at december 31, 2013, our proved undeveloped reserves are 34 percent of our total proved reserves; 93 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled for development within five years and 91 percent, or $3.2 billion, of our estimated future proved undeveloped capital is associated with the development of those reserves. the only exceptions are related to four planned sidetrack development wells in certain shelf and deepwater gom properties that cannot be executed until the current producing wells deplete. during the seven month period from june 1, 2013, to december 31, 2013, we invested $369 million and converted 19 mmboe to proved developed. during the seven month period from june 1, 2013, to december 31, 2013, we participated in 66 gross exploratory wells, of which 65 were successful, and 95 gross development wells, of which 94 were successful (refer to "drilling activities"). during this period, proved reserve additions from extensions and discoveries totaled 24 mmboe. the following table reflects the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes from the production and sale of our estimated proved reserves reconciled to the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows (standardized measure) at december 31, 2013 (in millions): estimated undiscounted future net cash flows before income taxes $ 19,647 present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes (pv-10) a,b $ 12,643 discounted future income taxes (3,226 ) standardized measure (refer to note 21) $ 9,417 a. in accordance with sec guidelines, estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials. reference prices as of december 31, 2013 , were $96.94 per barrel of oil and $3.67 per mmbtu of natural gas. these prices are held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. in accordance with the guidelines and excluding the impact of derivative instruments, the average realized prices used in our reserve reports as of december 31, 2013 , were $99.67 per barrel of oil and $3.64 per mcf of natural gas. our reference prices are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas and are calculated as the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical prices. 45 b. the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes (pv-10) is not considered a u.s. generally accepted accounting principle (gaap) financial measure. we believe that our pv-10 presentation is an important measure and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis, net operating loss carryforwards and other factors. we believe investors use our pv-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. pv-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under u.s. gaap and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. pv-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under u.s. gaap. probable reserves. all of our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves at december 31, 2013, are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of nsai and ryder scott. probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves, but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. in addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves, probable reserves may be assigned to areas where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonably certain criterion. probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. probable reserve estimates also include potential incremental qualities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. undeveloped reserves that meet the reasonably certain, economic and other requirements to be classified as proved undeveloped, except that they are not expected to be developed within five years, are classified as probable reserves. at december 31, 2013, our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves totaled 184 mmboe, of which 83 percent was comprised of oil (including ngls). probable oil and natural gas reserves estimated at december 31, 2013 oil a natural gas total (mmbbls) (bcf) (mmboe) probable developed b : gulf of mexico 22 34 28 eagle ford 1 2 2

recovery from existing production/injection wells that require minimal to no future development costs and reserves associated with work performed on existing producers/injectors that do not meet the reasonable certainty requirements to be classified as proved reserves. internal control and qualifications of third party engineers and internal staff. the technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates at nsai and ryder scott meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers. both nsai and ryder scott are independent firms of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; neither firm owns an interest in our properties nor are employed on a contingent fee basis. our internal reservoir engineering staff are led and overseen by our vice president of engineering, who has over 37 years of technical experience in petroleum engineering and reservoir evaluation and analysis. this individual directs the activities of our internal reservoir staff for the internal reserve estimation process and also to provide the appropriate data to nsai and ryder scott for our year-end oil and natural gas reserves estimation process. 46 drilling activities the following table provides the total number of wells that we drilled during the seven month period from june 1, 2013, to december 31, 2013: gross net exploratory productive: oil 40 35 gas 25 2 dry 1 1 66 38 development productive: oil 71 66 gas 23 8 dry 1 1 95 75 161 113 at december 31, 2013, there were 36 gross exploratory and 60 gross development wells (23 net exploratory and 19 net development wells) in progress, including 50 gross wells (5 net wells) in progress in the haynesville shale play and 36 gross wells (31 net wells) in progress in the eagle ford shale play. productive wells at december 31, 2013, we had working interests in 3,310 gross (3,153 net) active producing oil wells and 1,651 gross (238 net) active producing natural gas wells. one or more completions in the same well bore are considered one well. if any well in which one of the multiple completions is an oil completion, such well is classified as an oil well. at december 31, 2013, we owned interests in five gross wells containing multiple completions. 47 table of contents item 1a. risk factors. this report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of united states (u.s.) federal securities laws. forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; cash production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe); operating cash flows; capital expenditures; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities and costs; liquidity; tax rates; the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum, cobalt and crude oil price changes; the impact of derivative positions; availability of power, water, labor and equipment; reclamation and closure costs and plans; litigation contingencies; political, economic and social conditions; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; future dividend payments; debt reduction and share purchases. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following: financial risks declines in the market prices of copper, gold and/or oil could adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and asset values and, if sustained, could adversely affect our ability to repay debt. fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold or oil can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and common stock. our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and oil, and to a lesser extent molybdenum, silver, cobalt and natural gas. for further information about the market prices of our primary commodities, refer to the discussion below and md&amp;a. a substantial or extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, the value of our assets and/or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations, and could depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities. additionally, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, halting or delaying expansion projects, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may incur losses. fluctuations in commodities prices can occur because of varied and complex factors beyond our control, including: global supply and demand balances and inventory levels; global economic and geopolitical conditions; government regulatory, trade and tax policies; commodities investment activity and speculation; price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. copper prices may also be affected by demand from china, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, and by increases in demand for industrial products containing copper. factors particularly affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the u.s. dollar to other currencies, inflation and interest rate expectations, purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from china and india, two of the world ' s largest consumers of gold, and demand for jewelry containing gold. 48 table of contents crude oil prices may also be affected by actions of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other major oil producing nations; political and weather conditions in oil producing regions; transportation and refinery capacity; the amount of foreign imports of oil into the u.s.; and potential changes in u.s. laws restricting oil exports. substantially all of our copper concentrate and cathode sales contracts provide final copper pricing in a specified future month (generally one to four months from the shipment date) based primarily on quoted london metal exchange (lme) monthly average spot copper prices. accordingly, in times of rising copper prices, our revenues benefit from adjustments to the final pricing of provisionally priced sales pursuant to contracts entered into in prior periods; in times of falling copper prices, the opposite occurs. a decline in the price of crude oil, and to a lesser extent natural gas, could also result in a "ceiling" write-down of the carrying value of our proved oil and natural gas properties and/or of goodwill recorded in connection with our oil and gas acquisitions. at december 31, 2013 , the ceiling with respect to our oil and gas properties exceeded the net capitalized costs of those properties by approximately 4 percent, and we did not record an impairment. given the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, it is likely that our estimate of discounted future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves will change in the near term. if crude oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, even if only by a small amount, impairments of our oil and gas properties could occur. for further discussion of our accounting policies and estimates used in evaluating our oil and gas properties and goodwill for impairment, refer to note 1 and md&amp;a. any impairment charge related to our oil and gas properties or goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stockholders' equity, but would have no effect on cash flows. our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility. at december 31, 2013 , our total consolidated debt was $20.7 billion, including $17.2 billion incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition of plains exploration &amp; production company (pxp), and our total consolidated cash was $2.0 billion. although we have been successful in repaying significant amounts of debt in the past, there can be no assurance that we can do so in the future. we also have various other financial commitments, including for reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts, derivative contracts and leases. our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following: limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we operate; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt; or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments. in addition, a future downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital. at december 31, 2013 , our senior unsecured debt was rated "bbb" with a negative outlook by standard and poor's, "bbb" with a stable outlook by fitch ratings, and "baa3" with a stable outlook by moody's investors service. we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. in addition, a downgrade could affect our requirements to provide significant financial assurance of our performance under certain legal requirements and contractual arrangements. refer to the following risk factor for more information. under u.s. federal and state laws that require closure and reclamation plans for our mines, we generally are required to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement those plans if we are unable to do so. we are also required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with our oil and gas operations. the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. we are required by u.s. federal and state mining laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so. the u.s. environmental protection 49 table of contents agency (epa) and state agencies may also seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla) or equivalent state regulations. with respect to our mining operations, most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction. currently there are no financial assurance requirements under cercla, but in july 2009, epa published a notice identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements under cercla. in epa's semi-annual regulatory agenda issued in november 2013, epa indicated that it intends to propose regulations regarding hardrock mining financial responsibility in august 2016. it is uncertain how the new requirements, if promulgated, will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations. we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws. for example, permits, bonding and insurance are required to drill, operate, and plug and abandon wells. also, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (bsee) regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters require that lessees have substantial u.s. assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met. financial responsibility requirements are also required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill. boem has signaled its intention to redesign and implement revised financial assurance requirements associated with offshore plugging and abandonment obligations. boem has recently taken a stricter approach regarding the level of decommissioning liabilities to be included in its financial test for purposes of determining eligibility for exemption from financial assurance requirements. it is uncertain whether additional changes will be implemented by the boem and how these changes might affect the form and amount of our existing and future financial assurance obligations associated with our offshore activities in federal waters. as of december 31, 2013 , our financial assurance obligations associated with closure, reclamation and remediation in our mining and plugging and abandonment obligations in our oil and gas operations totaled approximately $2.4 billion , and a substantial portion of these obligations were satisfied by fcx guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. if our financial condition were to deteriorate substantially or our credit rating were downgraded, we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or collateral. these other forms of assurance would be costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines or suspension of the affected oil and gas operations. for additional information, refer to the environmental risk factor "mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations. we also have plugging and abandonment obligations relating to our oil and gas operations." movements in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our operating results. the functional currency for most of our operations is the u.s. dollar. all of our revenues and a significant portion of our costs are denominated in u.s. dollars; however, some costs and certain asset and liability accounts are denominated in local currencies, including the indonesian rupiah, australian dollar, chilean peso, peruvian nuevo sol and euro. generally, our results are positively affected when the u.s. dollar strengthens in relation to those foreign currencies and adversely affected when the u.s. dollar weakens in relation to those foreign currencies. refer to item 7a. "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" for a summary of the estimated impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our annual operating costs. from time to time, we may implement currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; however, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and any of our unhedged foreign currency payments will continue to be subject to market fluctuations. 50 table of contents international risks our international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the u.s. we are a u.s.-based natural resource company with substantial mining assets located outside of the u.s. (as of december 31, 2013 , substantially all of our oil and gas operations were in the u.s.). we conduct international mining operations in indonesia, peru, chile and the democratic republic of congo (drc). accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the u.s., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries. risks of conducting business in countries outside of the u.s. include: renegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts; expropriation or nationalization of property; changes in another country's laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters, which because of rising "resource nationalism" in countries around the world, may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment; political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism; changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities in which we operate with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety, infrastructure and community development and other factors that may affect our social license to operate, all of which lead to increased costs; foreign exchange controls; and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory. our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the u.s. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our international operations must comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws. although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of violations of such laws, any violation could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax matters with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities (refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters). other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below. because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia. our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia (pt-fi) pursuant to a contract of work (cow) with the indonesian government. maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among indonesia's most significant business enterprises. partially because of their significance to indonesia's economy, the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, 51 table of contents and the number of people employed, our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. in 2009, indonesia enacted a mining law (2009 mining law), which operates under a licensing system that is significantly less protective of licensees than the contract of work system that governs pt-fi. the 2009 mining law and the regulations issued pursuant to that law provide that contracts of work would continue to be honored until their expiration. however, the regulations, including those issued in january 2014, attempt to apply certain provisions of the 2009 mining law and regulations to existing contracts of work and seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work. in january 2012, the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team of ministers to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and to take steps to assess and determine the indonesian government's position on reduction to the size of contract concessions, increasing government revenues and domestic processing of minerals. we have been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government to complete this evaluation process and obtain an extension of the pt-fi cow beyond its primary term ending in 2021 to 2041, as provided under the terms of the cow, which can only be modified by mutual agreement between pt-fi and the indonesian government. we cannot predict the outcome of our engagement with the indonesian government regarding the relationship between the 2009 mining law and related regulations and our cow, nor whether or on what terms we will be able to secure an extension of our cow, but the outcome of these discussions may result in revisions to certain terms of the cow. in january 2014, the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12, 2017, but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates, including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates in the amount of 25 percent in 2014, rising to 60 percent by mid-2016. pt-fi's cow authorizes it to export concentrates and specifies the taxes and other fiscal terms available to its operations. the cow states that pt-fi shall not be subject to taxes, duties or fees subsequently imposed or approved by the indonesian government except as expressly provided in the cow. additionally, pt-fi complied with the requirements of its cow for local processing by arranging for the construction and commissioning of indonesia's only copper smelter and refinery, which is owned and operated by pt smelting (pt-fi's 25 percent owned smelter). the january 2014 regulations conflict with pt-fi ' s contractual rights under its cow. we are working with the indonesian government to clarify the situation and to defend pt-fi ' s rights under its cow. pt-fi is also seeking to obtain the required administrative permits for 2014 exports, which have been delayed as a result of the new regulations. as of february 21, 2014, pt-fi has not obtained administrative approval for 2014 exports. pt-fi has implemented near-term changes to its operations to coordinate its concentrate production with pt smelting's operating plans. since mid-january 2014, pt-fi's milling rate has averaged approximately 112,000 metric tons of ore per day, which is approximately half of normal rates. pt-fi is engaging with the government of indonesia to reach a resolution that would enable pt-fi to resume normal operations as soon as possible. in the event that pt-fi is unable to resume normal operations for an extended period, we plan to consider further actions, including constraining operating costs, deferring capital expenditures and implementing workforce reductions. pt-fi may also be required to declare force majeure under its concentrate sales agreements. in april 2014, indonesia will hold elections for legislators at the national, provincial and district levels. the presidential election will be held in july 2014, with a run-off in september 2014, if required. the outcome of these elections could affect the country ' s policies pertaining to foreign investment. indonesia has also faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. several separatist groups have sought political independence for the province of papua, where our grasberg minerals district is located. in response, indonesia enacted regional autonomy laws, which became effective january 1, 2001. the manner in which those laws are being implemented and the degree of political and economic autonomy they may bring to individual provinces, including papua, remain uncertain and continue to be ongoing issues in indonesian politics. in papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military. social, economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesian operations. 52 table of contents since july 2009 there have been 51 incidents in and around the grasberg minerals district, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations, which have resulted in 17 fatalities and 59 injuries. the safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and pt-fi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues. the investigation of these incidents is ongoing. we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys. any additional prolonged limitations on access to the road could adversely affect our indonesian operations. large numbers of illegal miners continue to operate along the river used to transport the tailings from the mill to pt-fi's government-approved tailings management area in the lowlands. the illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted unsuccessfully for years to move them away from our facilities. in 2006, the illegal miners temporarily blocked the road leading to the grasberg mine and mill in protest, and pt-fi temporarily suspended mining and milling operations as a precautionary measure. we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations. if other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time. for discussion of labor disruptions at pt-fi, refer to the operational risk factor "labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects." we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires. the initial term of pt-fi's cow expires in 2021, but can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. as a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow. prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 26 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31, 2013 , representing 32 percent of pt-fi's share of recoverable copper reserves and 45 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves. there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions. for further discussion, refer to the above risk factor "because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia." pt-fi's cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel. pt-fi's cow was entered into under indonesia's 1967 foreign capital investment law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements. certain indonesian laws and regulations may conflict with the mining rights established under the cow. although the cow grants to pt-fi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow, government agencies may seek to impose additional restrictions on pt-fi that could affect exploration and operating requirements. for discussion of the regulations published in january 2014 by the indonesian government, which conflict with our cow, refer to the risk factor "because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia." at times, certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998 ( i.e., during the suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including pt-fi's cow, which was signed in december 1991. we cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons. pt-fi's cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. accordingly, if a dispute arises under the cow, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an 53 table of contents international arbitration panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory. additionally, our operations may be adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending. the tenke fungurume (tenke) minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc, and may be adversely affected by security risks and political, economic and social instability in the drc. since gaining independence in 1960, the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence, changes in national leadership and financial crises. these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines (the ministry) in the drc, in february 2008, we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining s.a.r.l.'s (tfm) mining contracts. in october 2010, the drc government concluded its review of tfm's existing mining contracts and confirmed that they are in good standing. in connection with the review, several amendments were made to tfm ' s mining contracts and governing documents, and in march 2012, fcx's effective ownership in tfm was reduced from 57.75 percent to 56 percent. political, economic, social and security risks in the drc are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business. these risks include legal and regulatory uncertainties; exposure to an environment of governmental corruption and bribery; attempts to increase taxes or claims for fees and penalties by governmental officials, including retroactive claims; administrative disputes; security risks resulting from political instability in the drc; and risk of loss because of civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism. in addition to ongoing conflict in the eastern region of the drc, there have been acts of violence in the katanga province where the tenke minerals district is located. the safety of our workforce at all of our operations is our highest priority, and tfm works cooperatively with government officials to address security issues; however, no assurance can be given that conflict or random acts of violence will not occur near or impact tenke's operations. accordingly, our tenke operations and future development activities at the tenke minerals district may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could interrupt tfm ' s operations or future development activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. operational risks our mining and oil and gas operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business. mining . mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. these operational risks, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flow, include the following: earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters; the occurrence of unexpected weather or operating conditions and other force majeure events; the failure of equipment or processes to operate in accordance with specifications, design or expectations; accidents; wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses in our underground mines; interruption of energy supply; lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates; 54 table of contents metallurgical and other processing problems; unanticipated ground and water conditions; adverse claims to water rights, adverse outcomes of pending water adjudications and physical shortages of water to which we have legal rights; adjacent land ownership or usage that results in constraints on current or future mine operations; delays in the receipt of or failure to receive necessary government authorizations, approvals or permits; delays in transportation and disruptions of supply routes; and the inability to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage. managing the volume of waste rock, leach material and tailings produced in our mining operations also presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks. we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material, which are monitored for structural stability and leakages; our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions; and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage. in indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks, as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. the failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, property damage and damage to the environment, both in and around our areas of operations, as well as damage to production facilities and delays in or curtailments of production. oil and gas . our oil and gas operations are also subject to operating hazards, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids and pipeline ruptures, as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes, mudslides and hurricanes. our operations in california, including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles, are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury, property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density of southern california. our operations in the gulf of mexico (gom) and gulf coast region are particularly susceptible to interruption and damage from hurricanes. any of these operating hazards could cause personal injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous substances into the air, soil, water and groundwater and other property or environmental damage, lost production and revenue, remediation and clean-up costs and liability for damages, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may not be fully covered by our insurance. further, drilling, completing, and operating wells may also be delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected geologic conditions, increases in the cost of or shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and equipment, and delays in the issuance of required permits by governmental agencies. increased production costs could reduce our profitability and cash flows. our copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. for the year 2013, energy represented approximately 20 percent of our consolidated copper production costs. an inability to procure sufficient fuel and energy at reasonable prices could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our consolidated copper production costs are also affected by the prices of commodities we use in our operations, such as sulphuric acid, grinding media, steel, reagents, liners, tires and explosives. the prices of such commodities are influenced by supply and demand trends affecting the mining industry in general and other factors outside our control, and such prices are at times subject to volatile movements. increases in the costs of commodities that we consume or use may also significantly affect the capital costs of new projects. in our oil and gas operations, increased costs or unavailability of drilling rigs, workboats, experienced personnel, or other equipment, supplies or oil field services, which may occur particularly during times of increased industry activity, may adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget, and could have a material adverse effect on the financial performance of our oil and gas operations. 55 table of contents labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. as further described in part i, items 1 and 2 "business and properties" we are party to labor agreements with various unions that represent employees at certain of our mining operations (none of the employees of our oil and gas operations are represented by a union or covered by a collective labor agreement). labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and the risk exists that labor agreements may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. issues that may be raised by the collective bargaining units representing our employees are unpredictable and, if raised, negotiations concerning those issues may not be concluded successfully. our production and sales volumes could be significantly reduced and our business, financial condition and results of operations adversely affected by significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations. additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected. during 2011, pt-fi was adversely affected by labor disruptions, including an eight-day work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate three-month strike that concluded in december 2011. the strike involved civil unrest, transportation blockades, sabotage of important operating facilities and violence. additionally, during first-quarter 2012, pt-fi experienced work interruptions in connection with its efforts to resume normal operations and temporarily suspended operations. in october 2013, pt-fi entered into a new biennial labor agreement. in fourth-quarter 2011, there was an approximate two-month labor strike at cerro verde during the negotiation of a new labor agreement. the strike did not have a significant impact on production, and a new three-year agreement with the union was reached in late december 2011. in november 2013, cerro verde entered into a new four-year labor agreement with its union, which is effective upon the expiration of the current agreement, beginning september 1, 2014. as of december 31, 2013 , 49 percent of our labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements, and one percent of our labor force is covered by agreements that will expire during 2014 . if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies. our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. most of our mining operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. at our north america mining operations, certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights, which allow us to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. in arizona, we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the arizona courts have been attempting, for over 30 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the state's largest river systems, which affect four of our operating mines (morenci, safford, sierrita and miami). the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine. groundwater has historically been treated differently from surface water under arizona law, which has generally allowed land owners to pump at will, subject to the doctrine of reasonable use. however, court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water, thereby bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications. the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested, however, and is currently a primary focus of one of those adjudications. because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizona ' s water supplies, the re-characterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us, to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. because we are a significant user of groundwater in arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings. in colorado, our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority and administration of rights, including priority of some of our rights for the climax molybdenum mine. in new mexico, our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated. 56 table of contents water for our cerro verde mining operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. due to occasional drought conditions and the possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our current and planned cerro verde operations. cerro verde completed studies to assess opportunities for additional water supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects. cerro verde has reached agreements with the regional government of arequipa, the national government, the local water utility servicio de agua potable y alcantarillado de arequipa s.a. (sedapar), and other local institutions to allow it to finance, engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa. cerro verde has obtained authorization to reuse an annual average of one cubic meter per second of the treated water, which is expected to supplement existing water supplies to support the concentrator expansion. water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascot n aquifer. in 2010, el abra obtained regulatory approval, subject to certain conditions, for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascot n aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. el abra has sufficient water rights to support current operations; however, a change to the sulfide ore project, such as increased production or mill processing, would require additional water beyond our allowable groundwater pumping, which is permitted through 2021. el abra is conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing. water for our candelaria and ojos del salado mining operations in chile comes from a nearby wastewater treatment facility and our desalination plant and pipeline that were completed in 2013. both of these sources will supply candelaria's and ojos del salado ' s long-term water needs. although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, some supplies are subject to unresolved claims by others, and additional supplies that may be needed to support expanded operations are expensive, in short supply, and can be difficult to access because of logistical and legal obstacles. moreover, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights, claims and uses. loss of a water right, loss of continued use of a currently available water supply, or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations, by significantly increasing the cost of water, forcing us to curtail operations, preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations. in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our indonesia operations involve additional risks because they are located on unusually difficult terrain in a very remote area. the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia. these conditions require us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. in addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster. in may 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at pt-fi when the rock structure above an underground ceiling for a training facility collapsed. while the accident occurred outside the area of mining operations, pt-fi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections of its facilities in coordination with indonesian government authorities. following approval from indonesia's department of energy and mineral resources, pt-fi resumed open-pit mining and concentrating activities at its grasberg operations on june 24, 2013, and resumed underground operations on july 9, 2013. in april 2011, two pt-fi employees died in an accident when a portion of the doz underground mine experienced an uncontrolled muck flow. the area was temporarily shut down during the investigation of the accident. we have experienced mud/topsoil slides and slippages of material in and near our open-pit operations in the past, which have since october 2003 resulted in 11 fatalities and some production delays. no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future. 57 table of contents in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our africa mining operations involve additional risks because it is located in a remote area of the drc. the tenke minerals district is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to additional challenges, including severely limited infrastructure, including road, bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance; limited and unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained; challenges in obtaining experienced personnel; security risks; and limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues, including malaria, cholera and hiv. additionally, because of limited rail access, we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the tenke mines approximately 1,900 miles to ports in south africa. the tenke minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development. our reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly. there are numerous uncertainties and assumptions inherent in estimating mineral and oil and natural gas reserves, and geological, technical and economic assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. assumptions and estimates include the geology of the ore body or reservoir, development methods to be used and projected operating costs. fluctuations in these variables and in commodities prices may result in lower grade reserves or resources being deemed uneconomic, and could lead to a reduction in reserves or resources. our actual recoveries may vary significantly from our estimated reserves. decreases in estimated reserves could result in prospective increases in our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, which could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, and could also result in impairment charges. refer to notes 1, 20 and 21 and md&amp;a for further discussion. we must continually replace reserves depleted by production, but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries. our existing mineral and oil and natural gas reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. because our profits are derived from our mining and oil and gas operations, our ability to replenish our reserves is essential to our long-term success. our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits or reservoirs that can be produced profitably. we may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects (refer to md&amp;a for further discussion of our current development projects). the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, estimated capital and operating costs, and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity. the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines, wells, or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction or drilling schedules can adversely affect project economics. key factors that may affect the timing, costs and outcome of such projects include the following: geologic, geotechnical, hydrogeologic and weather conditions; hiring and training of personnel; issuance of necessary permits and licenses by governmental agencies; civil and political environment of the country or region in which the project is located; and access to or development of supporting infrastructure and availability of critical equipment. new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. the actual costs, production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 58 table of contents operations in the deepwater gom present greater operating risks than operations in the shallower waters or onshore. in addition, our shallow water and onshore operations that target ultra-deep prospects involve greater risks and costs than conventional gom shelf and onshore gulf coast prospects. the deepwater gom area presents significant challenges because of risks associated with geological complexity, water depth and higher drilling and development costs, any of which can cause substantial cost overruns. the deepwater gom also lacks the infrastructure present in shallower waters, which can result in significant delays in obtaining or maintaining production. as a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and marketability, thereby increasing the financial risk of these operations. our inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous exploration prospects target formations below the salt weld on the gom shelf and onshore in south louisiana. these targets have not traditionally been the subject of exploratory activity in these regions, so that little direct comparative data is available. to date, there has been no production of hydrocarbons from inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous reservoirs in these areas. the lack of comparative data and the limitations of diagnostic tools operating in the extreme temperatures and pressures encountered at these depths make it difficult to predict reservoir quality and well performance of these formations. wells drilled in these formations are also significantly more expensive to drill and complete than wells drilled to more conventional depths. major contributors to such increased costs include far higher temperatures and pressures encountered down hole, longer drilling times and the cost and extended procurement time related to the specialized equipment required to drill and complete these types of wells. our operations are subject to extensive regulations, some of which require permits and other approvals. these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations. our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. as a natural resource company, compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business. for additional information, see "environmental risks." we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety, including the requirements of the u.s. federal occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions. in the u.s., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the u.s. mine safety and health administration (msha) under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977. msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred. if such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. our oil and gas operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require, among other things, permits for the drilling and operation of wells and bonding and insurance to drill, operate and plug and abandon wells, and that regulate the safety of our pipelines. our u.s. offshore operations in federal waters are subject to broad regulation by the boem/bsee, which among other things must issue permits in connection with our exploration, drilling, development and production plans. under certain circumstances boem/bsee may impose penalties and may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases. many other governmental bodies regulate our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. in addition, new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. certain of our undeveloped oil and gas leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. approximately 41 percent of our total u.s. net undeveloped acres are covered by leases that expire from 2014 to 2016. with respect to our undeveloped oil and gas leaseholds, unless production in paying quantities is established on units during the term of the leases, the leases will expire. if leases expire and we are unable to renew or obtain new leases, we will lose our right to develop those properties. our drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, and regulatory approvals. refer to items 1. and 2. "business and properties" for further discussion of our oil and gas operations' acreage. 59 table of contents we have limited control over the development of oil and gas properties in which we have an interest but do not operate. certain of our oil and gas properties, including lucius, ram powell, lineham creek, haynesville and portions of our eagle ford acreage, are operated by other companies and involve third party working interest owners. as a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. additionally, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the operating costs and capital expenditures of such projects. these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for their operation and/or funding of these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, result in lower production and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions. cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. we believe that we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. environmental risks our operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain our expansion opportunities. our operations, both in the u.s. and internationally, are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances, waste disposal, air emissions, water discharges, remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including oil spill cleanup, mine closure and well plug and abandonment requirements, protection of endangered and protected species, and other related matters. in addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations. laws such as cercla and similar state laws may subject us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeport-mcmoran corporation (fmc) and certain of its affiliates. some of our onshore california oil and gas fields have been in operation for more than 100 years, and current or future legal requirements may impose substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these requirements. noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. in addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as other factors. for example, under the clean air act, epa recently lowered the national ambient air quality standards (naaqs) for sulfur dioxide. the area around our smelter in miami, arizona, has sulfur dioxide levels in excess of the new standard, and the smelter is the primary contributor to those levels. as a result, we are required to install pollution control equipment as part of an expansion that will allow the smelter to operate and comply with the new sulfur dioxide standard, but will increase our operating cost. in addition, in response to the 2010 deepwater horizon incident in the gom, the boem/bsee issued new guidelines and regulations regarding, among other things, environmental matters and decommissioning applicable to oil and gas drilling in the gom. these regulations require, among other things, independent third-party inspections, certification of well design and well control equipment and emergency response plans in the event of a blowout. 60 table of contents we also believe there has generally been more aggressive application of the endangered species act, resulting in increases in the number of protected species and expansive designations of their critical habitat, which may make obtaining federal permits and securing additional water resources more time-consuming, unpredictable and expensive. new or revised environmental legal requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business. for example, epa has proposed rules that, if effective, would reclassify some mineral processing materials as "hazardous waste" under the federal resource conservation and recovery act, which would reverse long-standing epa regulatory determinations and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements. other regulation under consideration by environmental regulatory agencies include provisions that would impose additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land use, and regulate environmental impacts of radioactive materials associated with mining operations and expand regulation of solid wastes, among other things. adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs and constrain our expansion opportunities. during 2013, we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of $595 million , compared with $612 million in 2012 and $387 million in 2011 . for 2014 , we expect to incur approximately $475 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and as actual spending occurs. we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on mining properties that have not been operated in many years. fmc and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the u.s. for more than a century. activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment. with the passage of cercla in 1980, companies like fmc became legally responsible for the clean up of hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them, including damages to natural resources, irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other prior and subsequent owners and operators, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the clean-up, although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. as a result, because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the u.s., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. at december 31, 2013 , we had more than 100 active remediation projects (including damaged natural resource claims) in 28 u.s. states. in addition, fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties, which contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and which from time to time become the source of claims against us. at december 31, 2013 , we had $1.2 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributed to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities. our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon: our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases involve events that occurred many decades ago; 61 table of contents our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates. significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material. in addition, remediation standards for environmental media imposed by epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become more stringent in the future. imposition of more stringent remediation standards poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation. refer to note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations. our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs. mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands. another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. in the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. from time to time, certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition. because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical. in connection with obtaining our environmental approvals from the indonesian government, we committed to perform a one-time environmental risk assessment on the impacts of our tailings management plan. we completed this extensive environmental risk assessment with more than 90 scientific studies conducted over four years and submitted it to the indonesian government in december 2002. we developed the risk assessment study using internationally recognized methods with input from an independent review panel, which included representatives from the indonesian government, academia and non-governmental organizations. the risks identified during this process were consistent with our impact projections of the tailings management program contained in our environmental approval documents. since 2005, pt-fi has participated in the indonesian government's proper (program for pollution control, evaluation and rating) program. pt-fi received a blue rating for the last proper audit by the indonesian ministry of environment. that audit was conducted in 2010, and the blue rating indicated that pt-fi's environmental management practices were in compliance with the laws and regulations of indonesia. since then, as allowed under environmental law 4/2009, the indonesian ministry of environment has continued to audit pt-fi but not using the 62 table of contents proper protocol, which has proven to be impractical for the size of the pt-fi operation. there have been no compliance issues, and the latest audit was in fourth-quarter 2013. mine closure regulations impose substantial costs on our operations. we also have plugging and abandonment obligations relating to our oil and gas operations. our u.s. mining operations are subject to various federal and state permitting requirements that include mine closure and mined-land reclamation obligations. these requirements are complex and vary depending upon the jurisdiction. the laws govern the determination of the scope and cost of the closure and reclamation obligations and the amount and forms of financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to meet the obligations of those plans if we are unable to do so. in general, our u.s. mines are required to review estimated closure and reclamation costs on either a periodic basis or at the time of significant permit modifications and to post increasing amounts of financial assurance as required by state regulators. it is uncertain how potential epa requirements for financial assurance will affect the timing of periodic closure cost reviews or the scope of closure activities. in july 2011, the chilean senate passed legislation regulating mine closure, which established new requirements for closure plans and became effective in november 2012. our chilean operations are required to update closure plans and provide financial assurance for these obligations. revised closure plans for the chilean mine sites are due in november 2014. cerro verde is subject to regulation under the mine closure law administered by the peruvian ministry of energy and mines. under the closure regulations, mines must submit a closure plan that includes the reclamation methods, closure cost estimates, methods of control and verification, closure and post-closure plans and financial assurance. an updated closure plan for the cerro verde mine expansion was submitted to the peruvian ministry of energy and mines in november 2013. in december 2009, pt-fi submitted its revised mine closure plan to the department of energy and mineral resources for review and has addressed comments received during the course of this review process. in december 2010, the president of indonesia issued a regulation regarding mine reclamation and closure, which requires a company to provide a mine closure guarantee in the form of a time deposit placed in a state-owned bank in indonesia. in accordance with its cow, pt-fi is working with the department of energy and mineral resources to review these requirements, including discussions of other options for the mine closure guarantee. we cannot predict at this time the cost of these mine closure plans or the levels or forms of financial assurance that may be required, which amounts could be substantial. additionally, substantially all of our oil and gas leases require that, upon termination of economic production, the working interest owners plug and abandon non-producing wellbores, remove equipment and facilities from leased acreage and restore land in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws. at december 31, 2013 , we had asset retirement obligations (aros) of $2.3 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet, which included $1.1 billion for our oil and gas operations. aro cost estimates may increase or decrease significantly in the future as a result of changes in closure regulations, changes in engineering designs and technology, permit modifications or updates, changes in mine plans, inflation or other factors and as actual reclamation spending occurs. refer to note 12 for further discussion. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations and markets. many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and, therefore, contribute to climate change. carbon-based energy is a significant input in our operations, and our revenues include significant sales of oil, ngls and gas, and other carbon-based energy products. a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory initiatives designed to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. many u.s. states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. for example, in california, the california air resources board (carb) has developed "cap and trade" regulations pursuant to the california global warming solutions act of 2006 intended to achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels, a 15 percent reduction by 2020. some of our operations in california are subject to these regulations, which require us to purchase offsets and allowance instruments ( i.e., 63 table of contents equivalent units equal to one metric ton of emissions under the california global warming solutions act of 2006). the total amount of instruments we must purchase will vary annually. while we do not expect these costs to be material, similar or more onerous state regulations could substantially increase our costs. in june 2010, the epa issued final regulations under the clean air act for the control of greenhouse gases from new large stationary sources and major modifications to existing large stationary sources. this and other federal greenhouse gas regulations have been challenged in judicial proceedings. certain of our operations, including the miami smelter, could be materially affected by these regulations if plant emissions exceed applicable thresholds. in addition, anticipated future epa regulations covering large fossil fuel fired power plants may materially increase energy costs at our operations. the u.s. may also become a party to international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which could lead to new regulations affecting our u.s. operations. from a medium and long-term perspective, we may experience increased costs relating to our greenhouse gas emissions as a result of regulatory initiatives in the u.s. and other countries in which we operate. in addition, the cost of electricity that we purchase from others may increase if our suppliers incur increased costs from the regulation of their greenhouse gas emissions. although we have modeled different scenarios, we cannot predict the magnitude of increased costs with any certainty given the wide scope of potential regulatory changes in the many countries in which we operate. increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may also reduce demand for the oil and gas we produce. the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. these may include changes in rainfall patterns, water shortages, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperatures. these effects may adversely affect the cost, production and financial performance of our operations. proposed federal, state or local regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase our oil and gas operating and capital costs. our oil and gas operations utilize hydraulic fracturing and other types of well stimulation. hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate the flow of oil and gas. hydraulic fracturing is necessary to produce commercial quantities of oil and gas from many reservoirs, especially shale formations such as the haynesville and eagle ford shale plays. the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions and agencies, and continues to receive significant regulatory and legislative attention at the federal, state, and local levels. several proposals are before the u.s. congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit or restrict the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to more extensive regulations. several states have adopted or are considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices that could impose more stringent permitting, transparency, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. in addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing, or are considering doing so. although it is not possible to predict the final outcome of any legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including those related to use of land and water, that are enacted in areas where we conduct our oil and gas operations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. other risks unanticipated litigation or negative developments in pending litigation or with respect to other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we are a party to the litigation and subject to other contingencies, including those described in note 12 and in item 3. "legal proceedings" involving such matters as asbestos exposure cases, disputes over the allocation of environmental remediation obligations at superfund and other sites, claims of personal injury and property damage arising from environmental contamination, disputes over water rights, disputes over taxes and other disputes with regulatory authorities. the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs. if any of these disputes results in a substantial 64 table of contents monetary judgment against us or is settled on unfavorable terms, or otherwise affects our operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a negative outcome in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. we depend on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of any of these employees could adversely affect our business. our success depends in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees. achieving this objective may be difficult because of many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors' hiring practices, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. we must continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior management and other key employees to maintain our current business and support our future projects. a loss of such personnel could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities, and our operating results could be adversely affected. our holding company structure may impact our stockholders ' ability to receive dividends . we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. cash at our international operations is also subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the u.s. in addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors. anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. these provisions: authorize our board of directors (the board) to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us; establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings; limit removal of directors for cause only; limit who may call stockholder meetings; and require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price. these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board. 65 table of contents in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us. these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.
