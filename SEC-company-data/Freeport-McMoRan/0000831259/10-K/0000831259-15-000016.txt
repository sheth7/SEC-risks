however, we have not had an arbitration during the more than 40 years we have operated in indonesia. pt-fi's original cow was entered into in 1967 and was replaced by the current cow in 1991. the initial term of the current cow expires in 2021, but can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. the cow allows us to conduct exploration, mining and production activities in the 24,700-acre block a area, which is where all of pt-fi's proven and probable mineral reserves and all its current mining operations are located. under the cow, pt-fi also conducts exploration activities in the block b area currently covering 502,000 acres. ongoing negotiations for an amended cow, discussed below and in note 13 , may result in relinquishments of the block b acreage. pt-fi pays royalties on copper, gold and silver in the concentrate it sells. prior to the modifications discussed below as of a result of the july 25, 2014, memorandum of understanding (mou), pt-fi had agreed to pay additional royalties to the indonesian government that are not required under its cow. the additional royalties provided further support to the local governments and to the people of the indonesian province of papua. pt-fi's share of the royalties totaled $115 million in 2014 (including the increased royalties per the mou discussed below), $109 million in 2013 and $93 million in 2012 . additionally, during 2014 pt-fi paid export duties totaling $77 million in accordance with regulations issued by the indonesian government on july 25, 2014. refer to note 13 and regulatory matters below for further discussion of increased royalties and export taxes. through joint venture agreements under separate cows, we were allowed to conduct exploration activities in papua, indonesia, through two other entities: pt nabire bakti mining (ptnbm) and pt irja eastern minerals (eastern minerals), of which we own 100 percent. the cows for ptnbm and eastern minerals expired in 2013, and we are working with the indonesia government to complete the process to terminate the cows and return the exploration areas to the indonesia government. we have completed the required notifications and reviews and are awaiting the termination acceptance documents. regulatory matters . as further discussed in item 1a. "risk factors," pt-fi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow. the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts, including pt-fi's cow, to address provisions of indonesia's 2009 mining law and subsequent regulations, including with respect to the size of contract concessions, government revenues, domestic processing of minerals, divestment, provision of local services, conversion from a contract of work to a licensing framework for extension periods, and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a contract of work's expiration. in january 2014, the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12, 2017, but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates, including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates. despite pt-fi's rights under its cow to export concentrates without the payment of duties, pt-fi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from mid-january 2014 through july 2014. on july 25, 2014, pt-fi entered into a mou with the indonesian government under which pt-fi and the government agreed to negotiate an amended cow to address provisions related to the size of pt-fi's concession area, royalties and taxes, domestic processing and refining, divestment, local content, and continuation of operations post-2021. execution of the mou enabled the resumption of concentrate exports, which began in august 17 table of contents 2014. the mou has been extended to july 25, 2015. pt-fi is engaged in active discussions with the indonesian government regarding an amended cow. provisions being addressed in the negotiation of an amended cow include the development of new copper smelting and refining capacity in indonesia, divestment to the indonesian government and/or indonesian nationals of up to a 30 percent interest (an additional 20.64 percent interest) in pt-fi at fair value, and timely granting rights for the continuation of operations from 2022 through 2041. negotiations are taking into consideration pt-fi's need for assurance of legal and fiscal terms post-2021 for pt-fi to continue with its large-scale investment program for the development of its underground reserves. effective with the signing of the mou, pt-fi provided a $115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development, agreed to increase royalties to 4.0 percent for copper and 3.75 percent for gold from the previous rates of 3.5 percent for copper and 1.0 percent for gold, and to pay export duties as set forth in a new regulation. the indonesian government revised its january 2014 regulations regarding export duties, which are now set at 7.5 percent, declining to 5.0 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 7.5 percent and are eliminated when development progress exceeds 30 percent. pt-fi is advancing plans for the construction of new smelter capacity in parallel with completing negotiations of its long-term operating rights and will also discuss the possibility of expanding industrial activities in papua in connection with its long-term development plans. pt-fi has identified a site adjacent to the existing pt smelting site in gresik, indonesia, for the construction of additional smelter capacity. refer to mining development projects and exploration for further discussion. under the mou, no terms of the cow, other than those relating to the export duties, the smelter bond and royalties described above, will be changed until the completion of an amended cow. pt-fi is required to apply for renewal of export permits at six-month intervals. in january 2015, pt-fi obtained a renewal of its export license through july 25, 2015. grasberg minerals district . pt-fi operates in the remote highlands of the sudirman mountain range in the province of papua, indonesia, which is on the western half of the island of new guinea. we and our predecessors have been the only operator of exploration and mining activities in block a since 1967. the grasberg minerals district has three operating mines: the grasberg open pit, the deep ore zone (doz) underground mine and the big gossan underground mine. we also have several projects in progress in the grasberg minerals district related to the development of the large-scale, long-lived, high-grade underground ore bodies located beneath and nearby the grasberg open pit. in aggregate, these underground ore bodies are expected to ramp up over several years to process approximately 240,000 metric tons of ore per day following the transition from the grasberg open pit, currently anticipated to occur in late 2017. refer to md&amp;a for further discussion. pt-fi's production, including our joint venture partner's share, totaled 651 million pounds of copper and 1.13 million ounces of gold in 2014 , 928 million pounds of copper and 1.14 million ounces of gold in 2013 and 695 million pounds of copper and 862 thousand ounces of gold in 2012 . our principal source of power for all our indonesian operations is a coal-fired power plant that we built in 1998. diesel generators supply peaking and backup electrical power generating capacity. a combination of naturally occurring mountain streams and water derived from our underground operations provides water for our operations. our indonesian operations are in an active seismic zone and experience average annual rainfall of approximately 200 inches. grasberg open pit we began open-pit mining of the grasberg ore body in 1990, with mining operations expected to continue through the end of 2017. production in the open pit is currently at the 3,220- to 3,760-meter elevation level and totaled 24 million metric tons of ore in 2014 , which provided 55 percent of pt-fi's 2014 mill feed. the current open-pit equipment fleet consists of over 500 units. the larger mining equipment directly associated with production includes an available fleet of 150 haul trucks with payloads ranging from 218 to 330 metric tons and 18 table of contents 16 shovels with bucket sizes ranging from 30 to 42 cubic meters, which mined an average of 298,000 metric tons of material per day during 2014 , 381,000 metric tons per day in 2013 and 399,000 metric tons per day in 2012 . grasberg crushing and conveying systems are integral to the mine and provide the capacity to transport up to 150,000 metric tons per day of grasberg ore to the mill and 75,000 metric tons per day of overburden to the overburden stockpiles. the remaining overburden is moved by haul trucks. ore milled from the grasberg open-pit averaged 69,100 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2014 and is expected to approximate 125,000 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2015. doz underground mine the doz ore body lies vertically below the now depleted intermediate ore zone. we began production from the doz ore body in 1989 using open stope mining methods, but suspended production in 1991 in favor of production from the grasberg open pit. production resumed in september 2000 using the block-cave method and is at the 3,110-meter elevation level. ore milled from the doz mine averaged 50,500 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2014 and is expected to ramp up to approximately 70,000 metric tons of ore per day in the second half of 2015. production at the doz mine is expected to continue through 2020. the doz mine fleet consists of over 250 pieces of mobile equipment, which is capable of mining an average of 80,000 metric tons of material per day. the primary mining equipment directly associated with production and development includes an available fleet of 52 lhd units and 20 haul trucks. each production lhd unit typically carries approximately 11 metric tons of ore. using ore passes and chutes, the lhd units transfer ore into 55-metric ton capacity haul trucks. the trucks dump into two gyratory crushers and the ore is then conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing. the success of the development of the doz mine, one of the world's largest underground mines, provides confidence in the future development of pt-fi's large-scale undeveloped underground ore bodies. big gossan underground mine the big gossan mine lies underground and adjacent to the current mill site. it is a tabular, near vertical ore body with approximate dimensions of 1,200 meters along strike and 800 meters down dip with varying thicknesses from 20 meters to 120 meters. the mine utilizes a blasthole stoping method with delayed paste backfill. stopes of varying sizes are mined and the ore dropped down passes to a truck haulage level. trucks are chute loaded and transport the ore to a jaw crusher. the crushed ore is then hoisted vertically via a two-skip production shaft to a level where it is loaded onto a conveyor belt. the belt carries the ore to one of the main underground conveyors where the ore is transferred and conveyed to the surface stockpiles for processing. although development activities continue, production from the big gossan underground mine was suspended for the majority of 2014. ore milled from the big gossan underground mine averaged 900 metric tons of ore per day for the year 2014 and is expected to ramp up to 7,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2018. the big gossan underground mine fleet consists of over 100 pieces of mobile equipment, which includes five lhd units and three haul trucks used in development and production activities. description of ore bodies . our indonesia ore bodies are located within and around two main igneous intrusions, the grasberg monzodiorite and the ertsberg diorite. the host rocks of these ore bodies include both carbonate and clastic rocks that form the ridge crests and upper flanks of the sudirman range, and the igneous rocks of monzonitic to dioritic composition that intrude them. the igneous-hosted ore bodies (the grasberg open pit and block cave, and portions of the doz block cave) occur as vein stockworks and disseminations of copper sulfides, dominated by chalcopyrite and, to a lesser extent, bornite. the sedimentary-rock hosted ore bodies (portions of the doz and all of the big gossan) occur as magnetite-rich, calcium/magnesian skarn replacements, whose location and orientation are strongly influenced by major faults and by the chemistry of the carbonate rocks along the margins of the intrusions. the copper mineralization in these skarn deposits is dominated by chalcopyrite, but higher bornite concentrations are common. moreover, gold occurs in significant concentrations in all of the district's ore bodies, though rarely visible to the naked eye. these gold concentrations usually occur as inclusions within the copper sulfide minerals, though, in some deposits, these concentrations can also be strongly associated with pyrite. 19 table of contents the following diagram indicates the relative elevations (in meters) of our reported ore bodies. the following map, which encompasses an area of approximately 42 square kilometers (approximately 16 square miles), indicates the relative positions and sizes of our reported indonesia ore bodies and their locations. 20 table of contents africa tfm is organized under the laws of the drc. we own an effective 56 percent interest in tfm, with the remaining ownership interests held by lundin mining corporation (lundin) (an effective 24 percent interest) and la g n rale des carri res et des mines (g camines), which is wholly owned by the drc government (a 20 percent non-dilutable interest). tfm is entitled to mine in the drc under an amended and restated mining convention (armc) with the drc government. the original mining convention was entered into in 1996 and was replaced with the armc in 2005, which was further amended in 2010 (approved in 2011). the current armc will remain in effect for as long as the tenke concessions are exploitable. tfm pays a royalty of two percent of net revenues under the armc, which totaled $29 million in both 2014 and 2013 and $25 million in 2012 . the tenke minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc approximately 110 miles northwest of lubumbashi and is accessible by paved roads and by rail. the deposits are sediment-hosted copper and cobalt deposits with oxide, mixed oxide-sulfide and sulfide mineralization. the dominant oxide minerals are malachite, pseudomalachite and heterogenite. important sulfide minerals consist of bornite, carrollite, chalcocite and chalcopyrite. the tenke minerals district contains an open-pit copper and cobalt mining complex, which commenced initial copper production in march 2009. tfm completed its second phase expansion project in early 2013, which included increasing mine, mill and processing capacity. construction of a second sulfuric acid plant is underway, with completion expected in 2016. we continue to engage in exploration activities and metallurgical testing to evaluate the potential of the highly prospective minerals district at tenke. these analyses are being incorporated in future plans for potential expansions of production capacity. future expansions are subject to a number of factors, including power availability, economic and market conditions, and the business and investment climate in the drc. the current equipment fleet includes one 10-cubic meter mass excavator, three 17-cubic meter mass excavators, four 12-cubic meter front-end loaders, thirteen 7-cubic meter front-end loaders, thirty-two 91-metric ton haul trucks and fifteen 45-metric ton haul trucks. copper and cobalt are recovered through an agitation-leach plant. production from the tenke minerals district totaled 447 million pounds of copper and 29 million pounds of cobalt in 2014 , 462 million pounds of copper and 28 million pounds of cobalt in 2013 and 348 million pounds of copper and 26 million pounds of cobalt in 2012 . the tenke minerals district is located in a tropical region; however, temperatures are moderated by its higher altitudes. weather in this region is characterized by a dry season and a wet season, each lasting about six months with average rainfall of 47 inches per year. the highest bench elevation is expected to be 1,520 meters above sea level and the ultimate pit bottom is expected to be 1,110 meters above sea level. the tenke deposits are covered by six exploitation permits totaling approximately 394,450 acres. tfm has long-term power supply and infrastructure funding agreements with la soci t nationale d'electricit , the state-owned electric utility company serving the region. the results of a recent water exploration program, as well 21 table of contents as the regional geological and hydro-geological conditions, indicate that adequate water is available during the expected life of the operation. smelting facilities and other mining properties atlantic copper . our wholly owned atlantic copper smelter and refinery is located on land concessions from the huelva, spain, port authorities, which are scheduled to expire in 2027. the design capacity of the smelter is approximately 300,000 metric tons of copper per year and the refinery currently has a capacity of 285,000 metric tons of copper per year. during 2014 , atlantic copper treated 1.1 million metric tons of concentrate and scrap and produced 294,100 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 283,800 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery. following is a summary of atlantic copper's concentrate purchases from our copper mining operations and third parties for the last three years: 2014 2013 2012 north america copper mines 21 % 13 % 16 % south america mining 21 % 32 % 31 % indonesia mining 8 % 16 % 10 % third parties 50 % 39 % 43 % 100 % 100 % 100 % during 2013, atlantic copper successfully completed a scheduled 68-day major maintenance turnaround. atlantic copper's major maintenance turnarounds typically occur approximately every eight years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. the next short-term maintenance turnaround is scheduled for the second half of 2015. pt smelting . pt-fi's cow required us to construct or cause to be constructed a smelter in indonesia if we and the indonesian government determined that such a project would be economically viable. in 1995, following the completion of a feasibility study, we entered into agreements relating to the formation of pt smelting, an indonesian company, and the construction of the copper smelter and refinery in gresik, indonesia. pt smelting owns and operates the smelter and refinery. pt-fi owns 25 percent of pt smelting, with the remainder owned by mitsubishi materials corporation (60.5 percent), mitsubishi corporation unimetals ltd. (9.5 percent) and jx nippon mining &amp; metals corporation (5 percent). pt-fi's contract with pt smelting provides for the supply of 100 percent of the copper concentrate requirements (subject to a minimum or maximum rate) necessary for pt smelting to produce 205,000 metric tons of copper annually on a priority basis. pt-fi also sells copper concentrate to pt smelting (at market rates) for quantities in excess of 205,000 metric tons of copper annually. during 2014 , pt smelting treated 911,500 metric tons of concentrate and produced 236,900 metric tons of copper anodes from its smelter and 231,800 metric tons of copper cathodes from its refinery. pt smelting's maintenance turnarounds (which range from two weeks to a month to complete) typically are expected to occur approximately every two years, with short-term maintenance turnarounds in the interim. pt smelting completed a 23-day maintenance turnaround during 2014, and the next major maintenance turnaround is scheduled for 2016. miami smelter . we own and operate a smelter at our miami, arizona, mining operation. the smelter has been operating for approximately 100 years and has been upgraded numerous times during that period to implement new technologies, to improve production and to comply with air quality requirements. as a result of new air quality standards for sulfur dioxide emissions, the miami smelter will install pollution control equipment as part of an expansion that will allow the smelter to operate and comply with the new standards by 2018. the miami smelter processes copper concentrate primarily from our arizona copper mines. concentrate processed through the smelter totaled 603,700 metric tons in 2014 . in addition, because sulphuric acid is a by-product of smelting concentrates, the miami smelter is also the most significant source of sulphuric acid for our north america leaching operations. major maintenance turnarounds (which take approximately three weeks to complete) typically occur approximately every 14 months for the miami smelter, with shorter term maintenance turnarounds in the interim.the scheduled 22 table of contents shutdown in fourth-quarter 2014 was extended for several weeks as a result of a furnace fire. repairs have been completed, and the smelter is operating at normal rates. rod &amp; refining operations . our rod &amp; refining operations consist of conversion facilities located in north america, including a refinery in el paso, texas; rod mills in el paso, texas, norwich, connecticut, and miami, arizona; and a specialty copper products facility in bayway, new jersey. we refine our copper anode production from our miami smelter at our el paso refinery. the el paso refinery has the potential to operate at an annual production capacity of about 900 million pounds of copper cathode, which is sufficient to refine all of the copper anode we produce at miami. our el paso refinery also produces nickel carbonate, copper telluride and autoclaved slimes material containing gold, silver, platinum and palladium. molybdenum conversion facilities . we process molybdenum concentrates at our conversion plants in the u.s. and europe into such products as technical-grade molybdic oxide, ferromolybdenum, pure molybdic oxide, ammonium molybdates and molybdenum disulfide. we operate molybdenum roasters in sierrita, arizona; fort madison, iowa; and rotterdam, the netherlands, and we operate a molybdenum pressure leach plant in bagdad, arizona. we also produce ferromolybdenum for customers worldwide at our conversion plant located in stowmarket, united kingdom. freeport cobalt . on march 29, 2013, we, through a newly formed consolidated joint venture, completed the acquisition of a cobalt chemical refinery in kokkola, finland, and the related sales and marketing business. the acquisition provides direct end-market access for the cobalt hydroxide production at the tenke minerals district. the joint venture operates under the name freeport cobalt, and we are the operator with an effective 56 percent ownership interest. the remaining effective ownership interest is held by our partners in tfm, including 24 percent by lundin and 20 percent by g camines. the kokkola refinery has an annual refining capacity of approximately 12,000 metric tons of cobalt, sufficient to refine the majority of the cobalt we produce in the tenke minerals district. other north america copper mines . in addition to our operating mines, we have five non-operating copper mines in north america ajo, bisbee, twin buttes and tohono in arizona, and cobre in new mexico that have been on care-and-maintenance status for several years and would require new or updated environmental studies, new permits, and additional capital investment, which could be significant, to return them to operating status. mining development projects and exploration we have several projects and potential opportunities to expand production volumes, extend mine lives and develop large-scale underground ore bodies. our near-term major development projects, which require substantial additional capital investment, include the cerro verde expansion and underground development activities in grasberg. refer to md&amp;a for further discussion of these and our other development projects. considering the long-term nature and large size of our development projects, actual costs and timing could vary from estimates. we continue to review our mine development and processing plans to maximize the value of our mineral reserves. capital expenditures for mining operations totaled $4.0 billion (including $2.9 billion for major projects) in 2014, $3.8 billion (including $2.3 billion for major projects) in 2013 and $3.5 billion (including $2.2 billion for major projects) in 2012. capital expenditures for major projects are primarily associated with the expansion projects at morenci and cerro verde and underground development activities at grasberg. capital expenditures for major projects for the year 2012 also included amounts associated with the expansion at tenke fungurume. capital expenditures for major projects at mining operations in the year 2015 are expected to approximate $2.5 billion and are primarily associated with the cerro verde expansion and underground development activities at grasberg. in connection with the mou between pt-fi and the indonesia government, we have agreed to pursue construction of a new smelter in indonesia subject to reaching agreement on our long-term operating rights. the preliminary scope of the smelting facilities and associated refinery involves smelting and refining capacity of approximately two million metric tons per year of copper concentrate. site selection and project definition studies are being advanced. planning for engineering activities is underway as we explore partnership options. we will be reviewing project scope during 2015. 23 table of contents we also have an additional long-term underground mine development project in the grasberg minerals district for the kucing liar ore body, which lies on the southern flank of and underneath the southern portion of the grasberg open pit at the 2,605-meter elevation level. we expect to mine the kucing liar ore body using the block-cave method; aggregate capital cost estimates for development of the kucing liar ore body are projected to approximate $2.4 billion (which are expected to be made between 2019 and 2032). additionally, our current mine development plans include approximately $5 billion of capital expenditures at our processing facilities to optimize the handling of underground ore types once the grasberg open-pit operations cease (we expect substantially all of these expenditures to be m ade between 2016 and 2034). our exploration activities are generally near our existing mines with a focus on opportunities to expand reserves and resources to support development of additional future production capacity in the large minerals districts where we currently operate. exploration results continue to indicate opportunities for significant future reserve additions in north and south america and in the tenke minerals district. the drilling data in north america also indicates the potential for significantly expanded sulfide production. drilling results and exploration modeling in north america have identified large scale potential sulfide resources in the morenci and safford districts, providing a long-term pipeline for future growth in reserves and production capacity in an established minerals district. exploration spending associated with mining operations totaled $96 million in 2014, $182 million in 2013 and $251 million in 2012, and is expected to approximate $100 million for the year 2015. sources and availability of energy, natural resources and raw materials our copper mining operations require significant energy, principally diesel, electricity, coal and natural gas, most of which is obtained from third parties under long-term contracts. energy represented approximately 20 percent of our 2014 consolidated copper production costs and included purchases of approximately 250 million gallons of diesel fuel; 7,600 gigawatt hours of electricity at our north america, south america and africa copper mining operations (we generate all of our power at our indonesia mining operation); 600 thousand metric tons of coal for our coal power plant in indonesia; and 1 million british thermal units (mmbtu) of natural gas at certain of our north america mines. based on current cost estimates, we estimate energy will approximate 16 percent of our consolidated copper production costs for 2015. our mining operations also require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. although we believe our mining operations have sufficient water rights, the loss of water rights for any of our mines, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights, could require us to curtail or shut down mining operations. for a further discussion of risks and legal proceedings associated with the availability of water, refer to item 1a. risk factors and item 3. legal proceedings. sulphuric acid is used in the sx/ew process and is produced as a by-product of the smelting process at our smelters and from our sulphur burners at the safford and tenke mines. sulphuric acid needs in excess of the sulphuric acid produced by our operations are purchased from third parties. community and human rights we have adopted policies that govern our working relationships with the communities where we operate and are designed to guide our practices and programs in a manner that respects human rights and the culture of the local people impacted by our operations. we continue to make significant expenditures on community development, education, training and cultural programs, which include: comprehensive job training programs basic education programs public health programs, including malaria control and hiv agricultural assistance programs small and medium enterprise development programs cultural promotion and preservation programs clean water and sanitation projects community infrastructure development charitable donations in december 2000, we endorsed the joint u.s. state department-british foreign office voluntary principles on human rights and security (voluntary principles). we participated in developing these voluntary principles with other major natural resource companies and international human rights organizations and they are incorporated into our human rights policy and site level projects. 24 table of contents we completed a corporate level human rights impact assessment in 2014, the results of which were used to evaluate our human rights program, including a review of our human rights policy. in february 2015, we updated our human rights policy to, among other things, reflect our commitment to integrating the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights into our human rights program. we also participate in a multi-industry human rights working group to gain insight from peer companies and evaluate ways to integrate human rights due diligence into our business practices and to support our human rights program. we believe that our social and economic development programs are responsive to the issues raised by the local communities near our areas of operation and should help us maintain good relations with the surrounding communities and avoid disruptions of mining operations. as part of our ongoing, annual commitment to sustainable community development, we have made significant investments in social programs, including in-kind support and administration, across our global operations. over the last five years, these investments have averaged $185 million per year. nevertheless, social and political instability in the areas of our operations may adversely impact our mining operations. refer to item 1a. risk factors for further discussion. south america . cerro verde has provided a variety of community support projects over the years. following engagements with regional and local governments, civic leaders and development agencies, in 2006, cerro verde committed to support the costs for a new potable water treatment plant to serve arequipa. in addition, an agreement was reached with the peruvian government for development of a water storage and distribution network, which was financed by the cerro verde civil association (the association). the association manages contributions made by cerro verde for projects that focus on education, training, health, cultural preservation and basic infrastructure. cerro verde has also reached agreement with the regional government of arequipa, the national government, sedapar and other local institutions to allow it to finance, engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa. treating this water will improve the regional water quality, enhance agriculture products grown in the area and reduce waterborne illnesses. in addition to these projects, cerro verde annually makes significant community development investments in the arequipa region. indonesia . in 1996, pt-fi established the freeport partnership fund for community development (the partnership fund), through which pt-fi has made available funding and technical assistance to support community development initiatives in the areas of health, education and economic development of the area. pt-fi has committed through 2016 to provide one percent of its annual revenue for the development of the local people in its area of operation through the partnership fund. our share of contributions to the partnership fund totaled $31 million in 2014 , $41 million in 2013 and $39 million in 2012 . the amungme and kamoro community development organization ( lembaga pengembangan masyarakat amungme dan kamoro or lpmak) oversees disbursement of the program funds we contribute to the partnership fund. lpmak is governed by a board of commissioners and a board of directors, which are comprised of representatives from the local amungme and kamoro tribal communities, government leaders, church leaders, and one representative of pt-fi on each board. the amungme and kamoro people are original inhabitants of the land in our area of operations. in addition to the partnership fund, pt-fi annually makes significant investments in public health, education, community infrastructure and economic development. security matters . consistent with our cow in indonesia and our commitment to protect our employees and property, we have taken steps to provide a safe and secure working environment. as part of its security program, pt-fi maintains its own internal security department. both employees and contractors are unarmed and perform functions such as protecting company facilities, monitoring shipments of supplies and products, assisting in traffic control and aiding in emergency response operations. the security department receives human rights training annually. pt-fi's share of costs for its internal civilian security department totaled $57 million for 2014 , $51 million for 2013 and $52 million for 2012 . pt-fi, and all businesses and residents of indonesia, rely on the indonesian government for the maintenance of public order, upholding the rule of law and the protection of personnel and property. the grasberg minerals district has been designated by the indonesian government as one of indonesia's vital national assets. this designation results in the police, and to a lesser extent, the military, playing a significant role in protecting the area of our 25 table of contents operations. the indonesian government is responsible for employing police and military personnel and directing their operations. from the outset of pt-fi's operations, the indonesian government has looked to pt-fi to provide logistical and infrastructure support and assistance for these necessary services because of the limited resources of the indonesian government and the remote location of and lack of development in papua. pt-fi's financial support for the indonesian government security institutions assigned to the operations area represents a prudent response to its requirements to protect its workforce and property, better ensuring that personnel are properly fed and lodged, and have the logistical resources to patrol pt-fi's roads and secure its operating area. in addition, the provision of such support is consistent with pt-fi's obligations under the cow, reflects our philosophy of responsible corporate citizenship, and is in keeping with our commitment to pursue practices that will promote human rights. pt-fi's share of support costs for the government-provided security was $27 million in 2014 , $25 million in 2013 and $22 million in 2012 . this supplemental support consists of various infrastructure and other costs, such as food, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police. refer to item 1a. "risk factors" for further discussion of security risks in indonesia. africa . tfm has committed to assist the communities living within its concession in the katanga province of the drc. initiatives include an integrated malaria control program, construction, renovation and building of local health facilities, construction and renovation of local schools, installation of over 100 clean water wells in rural villages as well as construction of urban water distribution systems, and economic development programs supporting development and training of local entrepreneurs, contractors and farmers. we have also made significant investments in infrastructure in the region that will have lasting benefits to the country, including upgrading a portion of a national road and the regional power generation and transmission systems. through the armc, tfm has also committed to contribute 0.3 percent of its net sales revenue to a community development fund to assist the local communities with development of local infrastructure and related services including health, education and agriculture. the tfm social community fund is managed by a board of directors comprised of two local community representatives, one representative nominated by the provincial governor and four tfm representatives. a community stakeholder forum comprised of 40 community representatives provides for increased community participation and input regarding project priorities, community needs, and transparency of fund management. the tfm social community fund contributions totaled $4 million in each of the years 2014 , 2013 and 2012 . security matters . tfm maintains an unarmed internal security department composed of both employees and contractors. the national government also has assigned mines police to the tfm concession area. the mines police are a division of the congolese national police and are responsible for maintaining security in mining concessions throughout the drc. tfm provides food, housing, medical services, supervised transportation, non-lethal equipment and monetary allowances as well as direct payments to the government for the provision of the security assigned to the concession area. the total cost to tfm for this support, including in-kind support, totaled $2 million in 2014 and less than $1 million in both 2013 and 2012 . tfm also participates in monthly

operations summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december 31, 2014 , in accordance with industry guide 7 as required by the securities exchange act of 1934. proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries. proven and probable mineral reserves were determined by the use of mapping, drilling, sampling, assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry, as more fully discussed below. the term reserve, as used in the reserve data presented here, means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. the term proven reserves means mineral reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. the term probable reserves means mineral reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. the degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. our mineral reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies. we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk. we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies. our estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees; a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining, geology and reserve determination. estimated recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves at december 31, 2014 , were determined using long-term average prices of $2.00 per pound for copper (consistent with the long-term average copper price used since december 31, 2010), $1,000 per ounce for gold and $10 per pound for molybdenum. for the three-year period ended december 31, 2014 , lme spot copper prices averaged $3.35 per pound, london pm gold prices averaged $1,449 per ounce, and the weekly average price of molybdenum quoted by metals week averaged $11.50 per pound. the recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves presented in the table below represent the estimated metal quantities from which we expect to be paid after application of estimated metallurgical recovery rates and smelter recovery rates, where applicable. recoverable reserves are the part of a mineral deposit that we estimate can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. recoverable proven

and silver through 2021, calculated by reference to its proven and probable reserves as of december 31, 1994, and 60 percent of all remaining cash flow. 32 table of contents in defining our open-pit reserves, we apply a variable cutoff grade strategy. the objective of this strategy is to maximize the net present value of our operations. we use a "break-even cutoff grade" to define the in-situ reserves for our underground ore bodies. the break-even cutoff grade is defined for a metric ton of ore as that equivalent copper grade, once produced and sold, that generates sufficient revenue to cover all operating and administrative costs associated with our production. our copper mines may contain other commercially recoverable metals, such as gold, molybdenum, silver and cobalt. we value all commercially recoverable metals in terms of a copper equivalent percentage to determine a single cutoff grade. copper equivalent percentage is used to express the relative value of multi-metal ores in terms of one metal. the calculation expresses the relative value of the ore using estimates of contained metal quantities, metals prices as used for reserve determination, recovery rates, treatment charges and royalties. our molybdenum properties use a molybdenum cutoff grade. the table below shows the minimum cutoff grade by process for each of our existing ore bodies as of december

sequencing the following chart illustrates our current plans for sequencing and producing our proven and probable reserves at each of our ore bodies and the years in which we currently expect production from each ore body and from related stockpiles. the chart also shows the term of pt-fi's cow. production volumes are typically lower in the first few years for each ore body as development activities are ongoing and as the mine ramps up to full production and production volumes may also be lower as the mine reaches the end of its life. the ultimate timing of the start of production from our undeveloped mines is dependent upon a number of factors, including the results of our exploration and development efforts, and may vary from the dates shown below. in addition, we develop our mine plans based on maximizing the net present value from the ore bodies. significant additional capital expenditures will be required at many of these mines in order to achieve the life-of-mine plans reflected below. mill and leach stockpiles mill and leach stockpiles generally contain lower grade ores that have been extracted from an ore body and are available for copper recovery. mill stockpiles contain sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through milling, concentrating, smelting and refining or, alternatively, by concentrate leaching. leach stockpiles contain oxide ores and certain secondary sulfide ores and recovery of metal is through exposure to acidic solutions that dissolve contained copper and deliver it in solution to extraction processing facilities. because it is generally impracticable to determine copper contained in mill and leach stockpiles by physical count, reasonable estimation methods are employed. the quantity of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles is based on surveyed volumes of mined material and daily production records. sampling and assaying of blasthole cuttings determine the estimated copper grades of material delivered to mill and leach stockpiles. expected copper recovery rates for mill stockpiles are determined by metallurgical testing. the recoverable copper in mill stockpiles, once entered into the production process, can be produced into copper concentrate almost immediately. 35 table of contents expected copper recovery rates for leach stockpiles are determined using small-scale laboratory tests, small- to large-scale column testing (which simulates the production-scale process), historical trends and other factors, including mineralogy of the ore and rock type. total copper recovery in leach stockpiles can vary significantly from a low percentage to more than 90 percent depending on several variables, including processing methodology, processing variables, mineralogy and particle size of the rock. for newly placed material on active stockpiles, as much as 80 percent of total copper recovery may be extracted during the first year, and the remaining copper may be recovered over many years. processes and recovery rates are monitored regularly, and recovery rate estimates are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available and as related technology changes. following are our stockpiles and the estimated recoverable copper contained within those stockpiles as of december 31, 2014 : recoverable million average recovery copper metric tons ore grade (%) rate (%) (billion

dorado field (s/2 viosca knoll block 915) and the king field (mississippi canyon blocks 84, 85, 128 and 129). the marlin field currently produces via a combination of platform and subsea tie-back wells while the dorado and king fields currently produce exclusively via subsea wells and tie-back infrastructure. c. the hoover platform is located in alaminos canyon block 25. the hoover field is located in alaminos canyon blocks 25 and 26. as further described in note 2, during 2014, fm o&amp;g completed the acquisition of deepwater gom interests, including interests in the heidelberg oil field and several exploration leases, and in the vito oil discovery and a significant lease position in the vito area. we have a 12.5 percent interest in heidelberg, a large, high-quality oil development project located in 5,300 feet of water in the green canyon area. the heidelberg truss spar was designed as a lucius-look-alike facility with capacity of 80 mbbls of oil per day. development drilling is in progress and the project remains on track for first production in 2016. we have an 18.67 percent interest in vito, a large, deep subsalt miocene oil discovery made in 2009, located in 4,000 feet of water in the mississippi canyon area (blocks 940, 941, 984 and 985). exploration and appraisal drilling in recent years confirmed a significant resource in high-quality, subsalt miocene sands. development options are under evaluation. our deepwater gom exploration portfolio includes interests in 169 blocks containing 70 prospects in the pliocene, miocene and lower tertiary reservoirs. gom shelf. our gom shelf properties are primarily located on the outer continental shelf in the shallow waters (less than 500 feet of water) of the gom and onshore in the gulf coast area of louisiana, with drilling depths not exceeding 15,000 feet considered to be traditional shelf prospects. 39 table of contents inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous. prospects with drilling depths below the salt weld (generally at depths exceeding 25,000 feet) are considered inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous prospects. california . onshore california. we hold a 100 percent working interest in the majority of our los angeles basin properties in the inglewood, las cienegas, montebello, packard and san vicente fields, and a 100 percent working interest in the majority of our san joaquin basin properties in the cymric, midway sunset and south belridge fields. the los angeles basin properties are characterized by light crude oil (21 to 32 degree american petroleum institute (api) gravity), have well depths ranging from 2,000 feet to over 10,000 feet and include both primary production and mature wells using waterflood recovery methods (whereby water is injected into the reservoir formation to displace residual oil), where producing wells have a high ratio of water produced compared to total liquids produced (high water cuts). the san joaquin basin properties are long-lived fields that have heavier oil (12 to 16 degree api gravity) and shallow wells (generally less than 2,000 feet) that require enhanced oil recovery techniques, including steam injection, and produce with high water cuts. we also hold a 100 percent working interest in the arroyo grande field located in san luis obispo county, which is a long-lived field that has heavier oil (12 to 16 degree api gravity) and well depths averaging 1,700 feet requiring continuous steam injection. offshore california. all of our offshore california properties are located in federal waters approximately five to seven miles offshore in the santa maria basin. we hold a 69.3 percent working interest in the point arguello unit, composed of the hidalgo, hermosa and harvest platforms, and the various partnerships owning the related transportation, processing and marketing infrastructure. we also hold a 100 percent working interest in the point pedernales field, which includes the irene platform, that is utilized to access the federal outer continental shelf monterey reservoir by extended reach directional wells and support facilities which lie within the onshore lompoc field. haynesville . the haynesville shale play is characterized by gas production from the jurassic aged haynesville shale formation in louisiana, and typical well depth is 10,500 feet. the area has historically been developed with approximately 4,000 foot horizontal wells at a measured total depth of 16,000 feet. madden . we own an approximate 14 percent working interest in the madden deep unit and lost cabin gas plant located in central wyoming. the madden deep unit is a federal unit operated by a third party and consists of acreage in the wind river basin. the madden area is characterized by gas production from multiple stratigraphic horizons of the lower fort union, lance, mesaverde and cody sands and the madison dolomite. production from the madden deep unit is typically found at depths ranging from 5,500 to 25,000 feet. exploration and development activities our oil and gas business has significant proved, probable and possible reserves, a broad range of development opportunities and high-potential exploration prospects. the business is managed to reinvest its cash flows in projects with attractive rates of returns and risk profiles. following the recent sharp decline in oil prices, we have taken steps to significantly reduce capital spending plans and near-term oil and gas growth initiatives in order to preserve cash flows and its resources for anticipated improved market conditions in the future. we are also evaluating third-party participation in our oil and gas projects to provide additional funding. fm o&amp;g has a large strategic position in the deepwater gom with significant current oil production, strong cash margins and existing infrastructure and facilities with excess capacity. these assets, combined with fm o&amp;g's large leasehold interests in an established geologic basin, provide financially attractive investment opportunities for high-impact growth in oil production and cash margins. fm o&amp;g's capital allocation strategy is principally focused on drilling and development opportunities that can be tied back to existing facilities. capital expenditures for oil and gas operations totaled $3.2 billion in 2014 and $1.45 billion for the seven month period ending december 31, 2013. capital expenditures for oil and gas operations for the year 2015 are currently estimated to total $2.3 billion , with approximately 80 percent of the 2015 capital budget expected to be directed to its highest return focus areas in the gom. we are committed to achieving our objective of funding oil and gas capital expenditures with oil and gas cash flows, third-party joint venture transactions or asset sales. fm o&amp;g is engaged in discussions to obtain funding from industry partners and other oil and gas market participants for a substantial portion of its 2015 capital expenditures to achieve this objective. third-party funding could also enable fm o&amp;g to complete additional development wells for production. 40 table

regulations and guidelines established by the sec, which require the use of an average price, calculated as the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference price as adjusted for location and quality differentials, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions and the impact of derivatives. reference prices for reserve determination are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas. at december 31, 2014 , our estimates were based on reference prices of $94.99 per barrel and $4.35 per mmbtu. all of our oil and natural gas reserves are located in the u.s. proved reserves. all of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at december 31, 2014 , are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of netherland, sewell &amp; associates, inc. (nsai) and ryder scott company, l.p. (ryder scott). the scope and results of procedures employed by nsai and ryder scott are summarized in letters that are filed as exhibits to this annual report on form 10-k. for purposes of reserve estimation, we and our independent petroleum engineers used technical and economic data including well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, well test data, production data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. our reserves have been estimated using deterministic methods. standard engineering and geoscience methods were used, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis and analogy, which we and our independent petroleum engineers considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with sec definitions and regulations. a substantial portion of these reserves are for undeveloped locations; such reserves are based on estimates of reserve volumes and recovery efficiencies along with analogy to properties with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. because these estimates depend on many assumptions, any or all of which may differ substantially from actual results, reserve estimates may differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover. proved reserves represent quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. at december 31, 2014 , our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled 390 mmboe, of which 74 percent was comprised of oil (including ngls). proved oil and natural gas reserves estimated at december 31, 2014 oil a natural gas total (mmbbls) (bcf) (mmboe) proved developed: gom 69 118 89 california 114 22 118 haynesville/madden/other 1 229 39 184 369 246 proved undeveloped:

and 3 mmbbls of proved undeveloped. at december 31, 2014 , we have an estimated total proved reserve life of 8.1 years and a proved developed reserve life of 5.1 years. at december 31, 2014 , proved undeveloped reserves represented 37 percent of our total proved reserves. with the exception of one planned sidetrack development well in one of our deepwater gom properties that cannot be executed until the current producing well depletes, 96 percent of our proved undeveloped reserves are scheduled 42 table of contents for development within five years, and $3.2 billion (or 95 percent) of our estimated future proved undeveloped capital is associated with the development of those reserves. total estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 144 mmboe at december 31, 2014, decreased by 13 mmboe from estimated proved undeveloped reserves of 157 mmboe at december 31, 2013. during the year 2014, we invested $657 million and converted 25 mmboe from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. in addition, during the year 2014, we sold proved undeveloped reserves totaling 15 mmboe associated with the eagle ford properties. partly offsetting the decreases in proved undeveloped reserves during the year 2014, were additions of 16 mmboe from the acquisition of interests in the deepwater gom (including interests in the lucius and heidelberg oil fields) and 9 mmboe through extensions and discoveries primarily associated with continued successful development in the deepwater gom at horn mountain. we also had net upward revisions to proved undeveloped reserves totaling 2 mmboe primarily related to the improved gas price realizations in the haynesville shale play, which was mostly offset by downward revisions resulting from deferred development plans, as well as lower oil price realizations and higher steam-related operating expenses resulting from higher natural gas prices for certain onshore california properties. during the year ended december 31, 2014 , we participated in 50 gross exploratory wells, of which 46 were successful, and 261 gross development wells, of which 259 were successful (refer to "drilling activities"). during this period, proved reserve additions from extensions and discoveries totaled 16 mmboe. the following table reflects the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes from the production and sale of our estimated proved reserves reconciled to the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows (standardized measure) at december 31, 2014 (in millions): estimated undiscounted future net cash flows before income taxes $ 12,065 present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes (pv-10) a,b $ 8,142 discounted future income taxes (1,721 ) standardized measure (refer to note 21) $ 6,421 a. in accordance with sec guidelines, estimates of future net cash flows from our proved reserves and the present value thereof are made using the twelve-month average of the first-day-of-the-month historical reference prices as adjusted for location and quality differentials. reference prices as of december 31, 2014 , were $94.99 per barrel of oil and $4.35 per mmbtu of natural gas. these prices are held constant throughout the life of the oil and gas properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. in accordance with the guidelines and excluding the impact of derivative instruments, the average realized prices used in our reserve reports as of december 31, 2014 , were $93.20 per barrel of oil and $4.35 per mcf of natural gas. our reference prices are the wti spot price for crude oil and the henry hub spot price for natural gas. b. the present value of estimated future net cash flows before income taxes (pv-10) is not considered a u.s. generally accepted accounting principle (gaap) financial measure. we believe that our pv-10 presentation is an important measure and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account the related future income taxes, as such taxes may differ among companies because of differences in the amounts and timing of deductible basis, net operating loss carryforwards and other factors. we believe investors use our pv-10 as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to the reserve estimates of other companies. pv-10 is not a measure of financial or operating performance under u.s. gaap and is not intended to represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. pv-10 should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under u.s. gaap. refer to note 21 for further discussion of our proved reserves. probable reserves. all of our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves at december 31, 2014 , are based upon reserve reports prepared by the independent petroleum engineering firms of nsai and ryder scott. probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves, but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. in addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves, probable reserves may be assigned to areas where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonably certain criterion. probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir. probable reserve estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the 43 table of contents hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves. undeveloped reserves that meet the reasonably certain, economic and other requirements to be classified as proved undeveloped, except that they are not expected to be developed within five years, are classified as probable reserves. at december 31, 2014 , our estimated probable oil and natural gas reserves totaled 245 mmboe, of which 81 percent was comprised of oil (including ngls). probable oil and natural gas reserves estimated at december 31, 2014 oil a natural gas total (mmbbls) (bcf) (mmboe) probable developed b : gom 27 33 32 california 8

wells that require minimal to no future development costs and reserves associated with work performed on existing producers/injectors that do not meet the reasonable certainty requirements to be classified as proved reserves. internal control and qualifications of third party engineers and internal staff. the technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates at nsai and ryder scott meet the requirements regarding qualifications, independence, objectivity, and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers. both nsai and ryder scott are independent firms of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists, and petrophysicists; neither firm owns an interest in our properties nor are employed on a contingent fee basis. our internal reservoir engineering staff are led and overseen by our vice president of engineering, who has over 38 years of technical experience in petroleum engineering and reservoir evaluation and analysis. this individual directs the activities of our internal reservoir staff for the internal reserve estimation process and also to provide the appropriate data to nsai and ryder scott for our year-end oil and natural gas reserves estimation process. drilling activities the following table provides the total number of wells that we drilled during the year ended december 31, 2014 , and the seven month period ending december 31, 2013 : year ended seven month period ending december 31, 2014 december 31, 2013 gross net

contents in addition to the wells drilled during 2014, there were 43 gross exploratory and 38 gross development wells (11 net exploratory and 8 net development wells) in progress at december 31, 2014 , including 59 gross wells (7 net wells) in progress in the haynesville shale play. in addition to the wells drilled during 2013, there were 36 gross exploratory and 60 gross development wells (23 net exploratory and 19 net development wells) in progress at december 31, 2013 , including 50 gross wells (5 net wells) in progress in the haynesville shale play and 36 gross wells (31 net wells) in progress in the eagle ford shale play. productive wells at december 31, 2014 , we had working interests in 3,069 gross (2,991 net) active producing wells and 1,710 gross (211 net) active producing natural gas wells. at december 31, 2013 , we had working interests in 3,310 gross (3,153 net) active producing oil wells and 1,651 gross (238 net) active producing natural gas wells. one or more completions in the same well bore are considered one well. if any well in which one of the multiple completions is an oil completion, such well is classified as an oil well. at december 31, 2014 and 2013, we owned interests in five gross wells containing multiple completions. item 1a. risk factors. this report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of united states (u.s.) federal securities laws. forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations relating to ore grades and milling rates; production and sales volumes; unit net cash costs; cash production costs per barrel of oil equivalent (boe); operating cash flows; capital expenditures; exploration efforts and results; development and production activities and costs; liquidity; tax rates; the impact of copper, gold, molybdenum, cobalt crude oil and natural gas price changes; the impact of derivative positions; the impact of deferred intercompany profits on earnings; reserve estimates; future dividend payments; debt reduction; and share purchases. we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. we caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following: financial risks declines in the market prices of copper, gold and/or oil could adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and asset values and, if sustained, could adversely affect our ability to repay debt. fluctuations in the market prices of copper, gold or oil can cause significant volatility in our financial performance and adversely affect the trading prices of our debt and common stock. our financial results vary with fluctuations in the market prices of the commodities we produce, primarily copper, gold and oil, and to a lesser extent molybdenum, silver, cobalt and natural gas. for further information about the market prices of our primary commodities, including the declines in copper and oil prices since mid-2014, refer to the discussion below and in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&amp;a). a substantial or extended decline in the market prices of these commodities could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, the value of our assets and/or our ability to repay our debt and meet our other fixed obligations, and could depress the trading prices of our common stock and of our publicly traded debt securities. additionally, if the market prices for the commodities we produce decline for a sustained period of time, we may have to revise our operating plans, including curtailing production, halting or delaying expansion projects, reducing operating costs and capital expenditures and discontinuing certain exploration and development programs. we may be unable to decrease our costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may incur losses. fluctuations in commodities prices can occur because of varied and complex factors beyond our control, including global supply and demand balances and inventory levels of the commodities we sell; global economic and political conditions; government regulatory, trade and tax policies; commodities investment activity and speculation; the price and availability of substitute products; and changes in technology. 45 table of contents in particular, copper prices may be affected by demand from china, which has become the largest consumer of refined copper in the world, and by changes in demand for industrial, commercial and residential products containing copper. factors particularly affecting gold prices may include the relative strength of the u.s. dollar to other currencies, inflation and interest rate expectations, purchases and sales of gold by governments and central banks, demand from china and india, two of the world ' s largest consumers of gold, and demand for jewelry containing gold. crude oil prices may be affected by continued development of shale reserves through hydraulic fracturing, actions of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and other major oil producing nations, political and weather conditions in oil producing regions, transportation and refinery capacity, the amount of foreign imports of oil into the u.s., and potential changes in u.s. laws restricting oil exports. since the second half of 2014, oil prices have declined significantly. after averaging $109 per barrel in the first half of 2014, brent crude oil prices averaged $90 per barrel for the second half of 2014 and declined to $57.33 per barrel on december 31, 2014, and were $60.22 per barrel on february 20, 2015 . lower oil prices, and to a lesser extent natural gas prices, were a contributing factor to the $5.5 billion of non-cash impairment charges recorded for the year ended december 31, 2014, to write-down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and reduce the goodwill associated with our oil and gas operations to zero. refer to notes 1 and 2 and md&amp;a for further discussion of these impairment charges. sustained weaker oil and natural gas prices could result in additional impairments of our oil and gas properties. copper prices have also declined. during 2014, the london metal exchange (lme) spot copper prices ranged from a low of $2.86 per pound to a high of $3.38 per pound and averaged $3.11 per pound. the lme spot copper price closed at $2.88 per pound on december 31, 2014, and has declined to $2.59 per pound on february 20, 2015. sustained lower copper prices could result in impairment of our long-lived mining assets and/or lower of cost or market inventory adjustments. refer to note 1 and md&amp;a for further discussion of our accounting policies and estimates used in evaluating impairment of our long-lived assets and our oil and gas properties. our debt and other financial commitments may limit our financial and operating flexibility. at december 31, 2014 , our total consolidated debt was $ 19.0 billion (see note 8) and our total consolidated cash was $464 million . we also have various other financial commitments, including for reclamation and environmental obligations, take-or-pay contracts and leases. our level of indebtedness and other financial commitments could have important consequences to our business, including the following: limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we operate; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, to engage in future development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt; or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt and/or fewer financial commitments. in addition, a future downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital. at february 20, 2015, our senior unsecured debt was rated "bbb-" with a stable outlook by standard and poor's, "bbb" with a stable outlook by fitch ratings, and "baa3" with a stable outlook by moody's investors service. we cannot be assured that our credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. in addition, a downgrade could affect our requirements to provide significant financial assurance of our performance under certain legal requirements and contractual arrangements. refer to the following risk factor for more information. 46 table of contents mine closure and reclamation regulations impose substantial costs on our operations, and include requirements that we provide financial assurance supporting those obligations. we also have plugging and abandonment obligations related to our oil and gas operations, and are required to provide bonds or other forms of financial assurance in connection with those operations. changes in or the failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us. we are required by u.s. federal and state mining laws to provide financial assurance sufficient to allow a third party to implement approved closure and reclamation plans if we are unable to do so. the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) and state agencies may also seek financial assurance for investigation and remediation actions that are required under settlements of enforcement actions under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act (cercla) or equivalent state regulations. with respect to our mining operations, most of our financial assurance obligations are imposed by state laws that vary significantly by jurisdiction. currently there are no financial assurance requirements for active mining operations under cercla, but in 2009, the epa published a notice identifying classes of facilities within the hardrock mining industry for which the agency will develop financial responsibility requirements under cercla. the epa has indicated that it intends to propose regulations regarding hardrock mining financial responsibility in august 2016. the epa's schedule has been challenged by environmental groups, which are petitioning the court to require the epa to finalize such regulations by january 2016. it is uncertain how the new requirements, if promulgated, will affect the amount and form of our existing and future financial assurance obligations. we are also subject to financial assurance requirements in connection with our oil and gas operations under both state and federal laws. for example, permits, bonding and insurance are required to drill, operate, and plug and abandon wells. also, the bureau of ocean energy management (boem) and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement (bsee) regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters require that lessees have substantial u.s. assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met. financial responsibility requirements are also required under the oil pollution act of 1990 to cover containment and cleanup costs resulting from an oil spill. boem has signaled its intention to redesign and implement revised financial assurance requirements associated with offshore plugging and abandonment obligations. boem has recently taken a stricter approach regarding the level of decommissioning liabilities to be included in its financial test for purposes of determining eligibility for exemption from financial assurance requirements. it is uncertain whether additional changes will be implemented by the boem and how these changes might affect the form and amount of our existing and future financial assurance obligations associated with our offshore activities in federal waters. as of december 31, 2014 , our financial assurance obligations associated with closure, reclamation and remediation in our mining and plugging and abandonment obligations in our oil and gas operations totaled approximately $2.6 billion, and a substantial portion of these obligations were satisfied by fcx and fm o&amp;g guarantees and financial capability demonstrations. if our financial condition were to deteriorate substantially or our credit rating were downgraded, we may be required to provide additional or alternative forms of financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or collateral. these other forms of assurance would be costly to provide and, depending on our financial condition and market conditions, may be difficult or impossible to obtain. failure to provide the required financial assurance could result in the closure of mines or suspension of the affected oil and gas operations. refer to notes 1 and 12 , for further discussion of our environmental and asset retirement obligations. international risks our international operations are subject to political, social and geographic risks of doing business in countries outside the u.s. we are a u.s.-based natural resource company with substantial mining assets located outside of the u.s. we conduct international mining operations in indonesia, peru, chile and the democratic republic of congo (drc). our oil and gas operations are located in the u.s., except that we expect to commence drilling at our first international oil and gas prospect offshore morocco in the first half of 2015. accordingly, in addition to the usual risks associated with conducting business in countries outside the u.s., our business may be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in each of these countries. risks of conducting business in countries outside of the u.s. include: 47 table of contents renegotiation, cancellation or forced modification of existing contracts; expropriation or nationalization of property; changes in another country's laws, regulations and policies, including those relating to labor, taxation, royalties, divestment, imports, exports, trade regulations, currency and environmental matters, which because of rising "resource nationalism" in countries around the world, may impose increasingly onerous requirements on foreign operations and investment; political instability, bribery, extortion, corruption, civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism; changes in the aspirations and expectations of local communities in which we operate with respect to our contributions to employee health and safety, infrastructure and community development and other factors that may affect our social license to operate, all of which lead to increased costs; foreign exchange controls and movements in foreign currency exchange rates; and the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international court or arbitration panel or having to enforce the judgment of an international court or arbitration panel against a sovereign nation within its own territory. our insurance does not cover most losses caused by the above described risks. accordingly, our exploration, development and production activities outside of the u.s. may be substantially affected by many unpredictable factors beyond our control, some of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. our international operations must comply with the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws of the other jurisdictions in which we operate. there has been a substantial increase in the global enforcement of these laws. any violation of these laws could result in significant criminal or civil fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we are involved in several significant tax proceedings and other tax disputes with the indonesian and peruvian tax authorities (refer to note 12 for further discussion of these matters). other risks specific to certain countries in which we operate are discussed in more detail below. because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia. our mining operations in indonesia are conducted by our subsidiary pt freeport indonesia (pt-fi) pursuant to a contract of work (cow) with the indonesian government. maintaining a good working relationship with the indonesian government is important to us because of the significance of our indonesia operations to our business, and because our mining operations there are among indonesia's most significant business enterprises. partially because of their significance to indonesia's economy, the environmentally sensitive area in which they are located, and the number of people employed, our indonesia operations have been the subject of political debates and of criticism in the indonesian press, and have been the target of protests and occasional violence. in 2009, indonesia enacted a mining law (2009 mining law), which operates under a licensing system that is less protective of licensees than the contract of work system that governs pt-fi. the 2009 mining law and the regulations issued pursuant to that law provide that contracts of work would continue to be honored until their expiration. however, the regulations, including those issued in january 2014, attempt to apply certain provisions of the 2009 mining law and regulations to existing contracts of work and seek to apply the licensing system to any extension periods of contracts of work. in january 2012, the president of indonesia issued a decree calling for the creation of a team of ministers to evaluate contracts of work for adjustment to the 2009 mining law and to take steps to assess and determine the indonesian government's position on reduction to the size of contract concessions, increasing government revenues and domestic processing of minerals. 48 table of contents pt-fi has been engaged in discussions with officials of the indonesian government since 2012 regarding various provisions of its cow. the indonesian government has sought to modify existing mining contracts, including pt-fi's cow, to address provisions of the 2009 mining law and subsequent regulations, including with respect to the size of contract concessions, government revenues, domestic processing of minerals, divestment, provision of local services, conversion from a cow to a licensing framework for extension periods, and a requirement that extensions may be applied for only within two years prior to a cow's expiration. in january 2014, the indonesian government published regulations providing that holders of contracts of work with existing processing facilities in indonesia may continue to export product through january 12, 2017, but established new requirements for the continued export of copper concentrates, including the imposition of a progressive export duty on copper concentrates. despite pt-fi's rights under its cow to export concentrates without the payment of duties, pt-fi was unable to obtain administrative approval for exports and operated at approximately half of its capacity from mid-january 2014 through july 2014. on july 25, 2014, pt-fi and the indonesian government entered into a memorandum of understanding (mou) under which pt-fi and the government agreed to negotiate an amended cow to address provisions related to the size of pt-fi's concession area, royalties and taxes, domestic processing and refining, divestment, local content, and continuation of operations post-2021. execution of the mou enabled the resumption of concentrate exports, which began in august 2014. the mou has been extended to july 25, 2015. pt-fi is engaged in active discussions with the indonesian government regarding an amended cow. provisions being addressed in the negotiation of an amended cow include the development of new copper smelting and refining capacity in indonesia, divestment to the indonesian government and/or indonesian nationals of up to a 30 percent interest (an additional 20.64 percent interest) in pt-fi at fair value, and timely granting rights for the continuation of operations from 2022 through 2041. negotiations are taking into consideration pt-fi's need for assurance of legal and fiscal terms post-2021 for pt-fi to continue with its large-scale investment program for the development of its underground reserves. effective with the signing of the mou, pt-fi provided a $115 million assurance bond to support its commitment for smelter development, agreed to increase royalties to 4.0 percent for copper and 3.75 percent for gold from the previous rates of 3.5 percent for copper and 1.0 percent for gold, and pay export duties as set forth in a new regulation. the indonesian government revised its january 2014 regulations regarding export duties, which are now set at 7.5 percent , declining to 5.0 percent when smelter development progress exceeds 7.5 percent and are eliminated when development progress exceeds 30 percent . pt-fi is advancing plans for the construction of new smelter capacity in parallel with completing of negotiations of its long-term operating rights and will also discuss the possibility of expanding industrial activities in papua in connection with its long-term development plans. pt-fi has identified a site adjacent to the existing pt smelting site in gresik, indonesia, for the construction of additional smelter capacity. under the mou, no terms of the cow other than those relating to the export duties, smelter bond and royalties described above will be changed until the completion of an amended cow. the revisions to the cow are expected to result in additional costs for our indonesian operations. we cannot predict whether we will be successful in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the terms of our long-term mining rights. if we are unable to reach agreement with the government on our long-term rights, we may be required to reduce or defer investments in our underground development projects, which would negatively impact future production and reserves. in addition, we are required to apply for renewal of export permits at six-month intervals and the next renewal date is july 25, 2015. we cannot predict if such permits will be granted on a timely basis or whether we will be permitted to export concentrates after july 25, 2015. in january 2015, the indonesian government issued regulations that require letters of credit to be posted to secure export sales of goods, which may impact pt-fi and pt smelting. such regulations are contrary to our cow, but it is possible that the indonesian government may seek to impose such requirements on pt-fi. these requirements could result in additional costs as well as administrative complexities, which could impact the ability to obtain customs clearance to export concentrates in a timely manner. indonesia has also faced separatist movements and civil and religious strife in a number of provinces. several separatist groups have sought increased political independence for the province of papua, where our grasberg minerals district is located. in papua, there have been sporadic attacks on civilians by separatists and sporadic but 49 table of contents highly publicized conflicts between separatists and the indonesian military. in addition, illegal miners have periodically clashed with police who have attempted for years to move them away from our facilities. social, economic and political instability in papua could materially and adversely affect us if it results in damage to our property or interruption of our indonesia operations. since july 2009, there have been violent incidents in and around the grasberg minerals district, including along the road leading to our mining and milling operations, which have resulted in 20 fatalities and 59 injuries. the safety of our workforce is a critical concern, and pt-fi continues to work with the indonesian government to address security issues. the investigation of these incidents is ongoing. we also continue to limit the use of the road leading to our mining and milling operations to secured convoys. we cannot predict whether additional incidents will occur that could disrupt or suspend our indonesian operations. if other disruptive incidents occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in ways that we cannot predict at this time. for further discussion of labor disruptions at pt-fi, refer to the operational risk factor "labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects." we will not mine all of our ore reserves in indonesia before the initial term of our cow expires. the initial term of pt-fi's cow expires in 2021, but can be extended for two 10-year periods subject to indonesian government approval, which pursuant to the cow cannot be withheld or delayed unreasonably. our proven and probable ore reserves in indonesia reflect estimates of minerals that can be recovered through the end of 2041, and our current mine plan and planned operations are based on the assumption that we will receive the two 10-year extensions. as a result, we will not mine all of these ore reserves during the initial term of the current cow. prior to the end of 2021, we expect to mine 23 percent of aggregate proven and probable recoverable ore at december 31, 2014 , representing 30 percent of pt-fi's share of recoverable copper reserves and 40 percent of its share of recoverable gold reserves. there can be no assurance that the indonesian government will approve our cow extensions. for further discussion, refer to the above risk factor "because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia." pt-fi's cow may be subject to termination if we do not comply with our contractual obligations, and if a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel. pt-fi's cow was entered into under indonesia's 1967 foreign capital investment law, which provides guarantees of remittance rights and protection against nationalization. the cow may be subject to termination by the indonesian government if we do not satisfy our contractual obligations, which include the payment of royalties and taxes to the government and the satisfaction of certain mining, environmental, safety and health requirements. certain indonesian laws and regulations may conflict with the mining rights established under the cow. although the cow grants to pt-fi the unencumbered right to operate in accordance with the cow, government agencies may seek to impose additional restrictions on pt-fi that could affect exploration and operating requirements. for further discussion, refer to the above risk factor "because our grasberg minerals district is our most significant operating asset, our business may continue to be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties and security risks in indonesia." at times, certain government officials and others in indonesia have questioned the validity of contracts entered into by the indonesian government prior to may 1998 ( i.e., during the suharto regime, which lasted over 30 years), including pt-fi's cow, which was signed in december 1991. we cannot provide assurance that the validity of, or our compliance with, the cow will not be challenged for political or other reasons. pt-fi's cow requires that disputes with the indonesian government be submitted to international arbitration. accordingly, if a dispute arises under the cow, we face the risk of having to submit to the jurisdiction of an international arbitration panel, and if we prevail in such a dispute, we will face the additional risk of having to enforce the judgment of an international arbitration panel against indonesia within its own territory. additionally, our operations may be adversely affected while resolution of a dispute is pending. 50 table of contents the tenke fungurume (tenke) minerals district is located in the katanga province of the drc, and may be adversely affected by security risks and political, economic and social instability in the drc. since gaining independence in 1960, the drc has undergone outbreaks of violence, changes in national leadership and financial crises. the drc held its first democratic elections in 2006. president joseph kabila, elected in 2006 and currently serving his second term, is not eligible under the drc constitution for reelection. the next presidential election is scheduled to be held in 2016. these factors heighten the risk of abrupt changes in the national policy toward foreign investors, which in turn could result in unilateral modification of concessions or contracts, increased taxation, denial of permits or permit renewals or expropriation of assets. as part of a review of all mining contracts by the ministry of mines (the ministry) in the drc, in february 2008, we received notification that the ministry wished to renegotiate several material provisions of tenke fungurume mining s.a.'s (tfm) mining contracts. in october 2010, the drc government concluded its review of tfm's existing mining contracts and confirmed that they are in good standing. in connection with the review, several amendments were made to tfm ' s mining contracts and governing documents, and in march 2012, fcx's effective ownership in tfm was reduced from 57.75 percent to 56 percent. political, economic, social and security risks in the drc are generally outside of our control and could adversely affect our business. these risks include legal and regulatory uncertainties; exposure to an environment of governmental corruption and bribery; attempts to increase taxes or claims for fees and penalties by governmental officials, including retroactive claims; administrative disputes; security risks resulting from political instability in the drc; and risk of loss because of civil strife, acts of war, guerrilla activities, insurrection and terrorism. in addition to ongoing conflict in the eastern region of the drc, there have been acts of violence in the katanga province where the tenke minerals district is located. the safety of our workforce at all of our operations is our highest priority, and tfm works cooperatively with government officials to address security issues; however, no assurance can be given that conflict or random acts of violence will not occur near or impact tenke's operations. accordingly, our tenke operations and future development activities at the tenke minerals district may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, any of which could interrupt tfm ' s operations or future development activities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. operational risks our mining and oil and gas operations are subject to operational risks that could adversely affect our business. mines by their nature are subject to many operational risks, some of which are outside of our control, and many of which are not covered fully, or in some cases even partially, by insurance. these operational risks, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and cash flow, include earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters; equipment failures; accidents; wall failures and rock slides in our open-pit mines, and structural collapses in our underground mines; and lower than expected ore grades or recovery rates. managing the volume of waste rock, leach material and tailings produced in our mining operations also presents significant environmental, safety and engineering challenges and risks. we maintain large leach pads and tailings impoundments containing viscous material, which are effectively large dams that must be engineered, constructed and monitored to assure structural stability and avoid leakages or structural collapse; our tailings impoundments in arid areas must have effective programs to suppress fugitive dust emissions, and we must effectively monitor and treat acid rock drainage. in indonesia, we use a river transport system for tailings management, which presents other risks, as discussed elsewhere in these risk factors. the failure of the systems or structures used to successfully manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, property damage and damage to the environment, both in and around our areas of operations, as well as damage to production facilities and delays in or curtailments of production. our oil and gas operations are also subject to operating hazards, including well blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, uncontrollable flows of oil, gas or well fluids and pipeline ruptures, as well as natural disasters such as earthquakes, mudslides and hurricanes. our operations in california, including transportation of oil by pipelines within the city and county of los angeles, are especially susceptible to damage from earthquakes and involve increased risks of personal injury, property damage and marketing interruptions because of the population density 51 table of contents of southern california. our operations in the gulf of mexico (gom) and gulf coast region are particularly susceptible to interruption and damage from hurricanes. any of these operating hazards could cause personal injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous substances into the air, soil, water and groundwater and other property or environmental damage, lost production and revenue, remediation and clean-up costs and liability for damages, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and may not be fully covered by our insurance. labor unrest and activism could disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. as of december 31, 2014, 48 percent of our global labor force was covered by collective bargaining agreements and 28 percent of our global labor force was covered by agreements that will expire during 2015, including the agreement covering employees at our indonesia operations. none of the employees of our oil and gas operations are represented by a union or covered by a collective labor agreement. labor agreements are negotiated on a periodic basis, and may not be renewed on reasonably satisfactory terms to us or at all. if we do not successfully negotiate new collective bargaining agreements with our union workers, we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our mining operations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. additionally, if we enter into a new labor agreement with any union that significantly increases our labor costs relative to our competitors, our ability to compete may be materially and adversely affected. refer to items 1 and 2, "business and properties," for additional information regarding labor matters, and expiration dates of such agreements. we could also experience labor disruptions such as work stoppages, work slowdowns, union organizing campaigns, strikes, or lockouts which could adversely affect our operations. for example, our pt-fi operations experienced an eight-day work stoppage in july 2011 and an approximate three-month strike that concluded in december 2011. the strike involved civil unrest, transportation blockades, sabotage of important operating facilities and violence. operations were also temporarily suspended during first-quarter 2012 when pt-fi experienced work interruptions in connection with its efforts to resume normal operations following the strike. in october 2014, a large percentage of grasberg open-pit operators did not report to their scheduled shifts, notwithstanding approval of resumption of operations by indonesian authorities upon completion of their investigation of a fatal haul truck accident that occurred near the grasberg open-pit. significant reductions in productivity or protracted work stoppages at one or more of our operations could significantly reduce our production and sales volumes, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. our mining production depends on the availability of sufficient water supplies. our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. most of our mining operations in north and south america are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. continuous production at our mines is dependent on our ability to maintain our water rights and claims, and the continuing physical availability of the water supplies. at our north america mining operations, certain of our water supplies are supported by surface water rights, which allow us to use public waters for a statutorily defined beneficial use at a designated location. in arizona, where our operations use both surface and ground water, we are a participant in two active general stream adjudications in which the arizona courts have been attempting, for over 40 years, to quantify and prioritize surface water claims for two of the state's largest river systems, which affect four of our operating mines (morenci, safford, sierrita and miami). the legal precedent set in these proceedings may also affect our bagdad mine. the adjudications are addressing the state law claims of thousands of competing users, including us, as well as very significant federally based water claims of u.s. interests in arizona that are potentially adverse to the claims of surface water and groundwater users under state law. groundwater is treated differently from surface water under arizona law, which historically allowed land owners to pump at will, subject to the doctrine of reasonable use. however, court decisions in one of the adjudications have concluded that groundwater pumping may affect surface water, thereby effectively making it surface water and bringing the pumping within the jurisdiction of the general stream adjudications. the effort to define the boundaries between groundwater and surface water remains contested and is currently a primary focus of one of those adjudications. because groundwater accounts for approximately 40 percent of arizona ' s water supplies, the re-characterization of any significant portion of that water as surface water could jeopardize the ability of consumers, farmers, ranchers, municipalities, and industrial users like us, to continue to access water supplies that have been relied on for decades. because we are a significant user of both groundwater and surface water in arizona, we are an active participant in the adjudication proceedings. 52 table of contents in colorado, our surface water and groundwater rights are subject to adjudication and we are involved in legal proceedings to resolve disputes regarding priority and administration of rights, including priority of some of our rights for the climax molybdenum mine. in new mexico, our surface water and groundwater rights are fully licensed or have been fully adjudicated. water for our cerro verde operation in peru comes from renewable sources through a series of storage reservoirs on the rio chili watershed that collect water primarily from seasonal precipitation. due to occasional drought conditions and the possibility that climate change will reduce precipitation levels, temporary supply shortages are possible that could affect our current and planned cerro verde operations. cerro verde has completed studies to assess opportunities for additional water supplies to support current operations and potential future expansion projects. cerro verde has reached agreements with the regional government of arequipa, the national government, the local water utility servicio de agua potable y alcantarillado de arequipa s.a. (sedapar), and other local institutions to allow it to finance, engineer and construct a wastewater treatment plant for the city of arequipa. cerro verde has obtained authorization to reuse an annual average of one cubic meter per second of the treated water, which is expected to supplement existing water supplies to support the concentrator expansion. water for our el abra mining operation in chile comes from the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascot n aquifer. in 2010, el abra obtained regulatory approval, subject to certain conditions, for the continued pumping of groundwater from the salar de ascot n aquifer for its sulfide processing plant, which began operations in 2011. el abra has sufficient water rights and regulatory approvals to support current operations; however, a change to the sulfide ore project, such as increased production or mill processing, would require additional water beyond our allowable groundwater pumping, which is permitted through 2021. el abra is conducting studies to assess the feasibility of constructing a desalination plant near the pacific ocean to treat seawater for possible increased sulfide ore production or mill processing. although each of our mining operations currently has access to sufficient water supplies to support current operational demands, some supplies are subject to unresolved claims by others, and additional supplies that may be needed to support expanded operations are expensive, in short supply, and can be difficult to access because of logistical and legal obstacles. moreover, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings on our water rights, claims and uses. loss of a water right, loss of continued use of a currently available water supply, or inability to expand our water resources could materially and adversely affect our mining operations, by significantly increasing the cost of water, forcing us to curtail operations, preventing us from expanding operations or forcing premature closures, thereby increasing and/or accelerating costs or foregoing profitable operations. in addition to the usual risks encountered in the mining industry, our indonesia and africa mining operations involve additional risks because they are located in very remote areas and, in indonesia, unusually difficult terrain. the grasberg minerals district is located in steep mountainous terrain in a remote area of indonesia. these conditions have required us to overcome special engineering difficulties and develop extensive infrastructure facilities. in addition, the area receives considerable rainfall, which has led to periodic floods and mudslides. the mine site is also in an active seismic area and has experienced earth tremors from time to time. our insurance may not sufficiently cover an unexpected natural or operating disaster. underground mining operations can be particularly dangerous, and in may 2013, a tragic accident, which resulted in 28 fatalities and 10 injuries, occurred at pt-fi when the rock structure above the underground ceiling of a training facility collapsed. pt-fi temporarily suspended mining and processing activities at the grasberg complex to conduct inspections and resumed open-pit mining and concentrating activities on june 24, 2013, and underground operations on july 9, 2013. in april 2011, two pt-fi employees died in an accident when a portion of the doz underground mine experienced an uncontrolled muck flow. no assurance can be given that similar events will not occur in the future. the tenke minerals district is located in a remote area of the drc and is subject to challenges, such as severely limited infrastructure, including road, bridge and rail access that is in disrepair and receives minimal maintenance; limited and unreliable energy supply from antiquated equipment and from power distribution corridors that are not maintained; difficulties in attracting and retaining experienced personnel; security risks; and limited health care in an area plagued by disease and other potential endemic health issues, including malaria, cholera and hiv. 53 table of contents additionally, because of limited rail access, we currently truck a significant portion of the production from the tenke mines approximately 1,900 miles to ports in south africa. the tenke minerals district and its future development may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect their contribution to our operating results and increase the cost of future development. we must continually replace reserves depleted by production, but our exploration activities may not result in additional discoveries. our existing mineral and oil and natural gas reserves will be depleted over time by production from our operations. because our profits are derived from our mining and oil and gas operations, our ability to replenish our reserves is essential to our long-term success. our exploration projects involve many risks, require substantial expenditures and may not result in the discovery of additional deposits or reservoirs that can be produced profitably. we may not be able to discover, enhance, develop or acquire reserves in sufficient quantities to maintain or grow our current reserve levels, which could negatively affect our business and prospects. development projects are inherently risky and may require more capital than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business. there are many risks and uncertainties inherent in all development projects (refer to md&amp;a for further discussion of our current development projects). the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors, including the accuracy of estimated reserves, estimated capital and operating costs, and estimated future prices of the relevant commodity. the capital expenditures and time required to develop new mines, wells, or other projects are considerable, and changes in costs or construction or drilling schedules can adversely affect project economics. new development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow. the actual costs, production rates and economic returns of our development projects may differ materially from our estimates, which may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. operations in the deepwater gom present greater operating risks than operations in the shallower waters or onshore. in addition, our shallow water and onshore operations that target ultra-deep prospects involve greater risks and costs than conventional gom shelf and onshore gulf coast prospects. the deepwater gom presents significant challenges because of risks associated with geological complexity, water depth and higher drilling and development costs. for example, in april 2010, the deepwater horizon, an unaffiliated offshore drilling rig located in the deepwater gom, sank following an explosion and fire, resulting in fatalities and the discharge of substantial amounts of oil into the gom until mid-july 2010 when the flow of oil was finally stopped. the u.s. department of interior imposed a moratorium on deepwater drilling from may through october 2010 and also issued a series of rules and notices to lessees and operators imposing new and more stringent regulatory safety and performance requirements and permitting procedures for new wells to be drilled in the deepwater gom, all of which significantly and adversely disrupted oil and gas exploration activities in the gom and resulted in increased costs. the deepwater gom also lacks the infrastructure present in shallower waters, which can result in significant delays in obtaining or maintaining production. as a result, deepwater operations may require significant time between a discovery and marketability, thereby increasing the financial risk of these operations. our inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous exploration prospects target formations below the salt weld on the gom shelf and onshore in south louisiana. these targets have not traditionally been the subject of exploratory activity in these regions, so that little direct comparative data is available. on february 25, 2015, the highlander discovery, located onshore in south louisiana in the inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous trend, began production. prior to this date there had been no commercial production of hydrocarbons from inboard lower tertiary/cretaceous reservoirs in these areas. the lack of comparative data and the limitations of diagnostic tools operating in the extreme temperatures and pressures encountered at these depths make it difficult to predict reservoir quality and well performance of these formations. it is also significantly more risky and expensive to drill and complete wells in these formations than at more conventional depths. major contributors to such increased risks and costs include far higher temperatures and pressures encountered down hole, longer drilling times, extended procurement time and increased costs associated with the specialized equipment required to drill and complete wells in these formations. 54 table of contents our operations are subject to extensive regulations, some of which require permits and other approvals. these regulations increase our costs and in some circumstances may delay or suspend our operations. our operations are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that are subject to change and to changing interpretation by governmental agencies and other bodies vested with broad supervisory authority. as a natural resource company, compliance with environmental legal requirements is an integral and costly part of our business. for additional information, see "environmental risks." we are also subject to extensive regulation of worker health and safety, including the requirements of the u.s. occupational safety and health act and similar laws of other jurisdictions. in the u.s., the operation of our mines is subject to regulation by the u.s. mine safety and health administration (msha) under the federal mine safety and health act of 1977. msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred. if such inspections result in an alleged violation, we may be subject to fines and penalties and, in instances of alleged significant violations, our mining operations could be subject to temporary or extended closures. our oil and gas operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require, among other things, permits for the drilling and operation of wells and bonding and insurance to drill, operate and plug and abandon wells, and that regulate the safety of our pipelines. our u.s. offshore operations in federal waters are subject to broad regulation by the boem/bsee, which among other things must issue permits in connection with our exploration, drilling, development and production plans. under certain circumstances boem/bsee may impose penalties and may suspend or terminate any of our operations on federal leases. many other governmental bodies regulate our operations, and our failure to comply with these legal requirements can result in substantial penalties. in addition, new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations by courts or regulatory authorities occur regularly, but are difficult to predict. any such variations could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. our business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions. cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. we believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. however, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could be subject to manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. environmental risks our operations are subject to complex and evolving environmental laws and regulations. compliance with environmental regulatory requirements involves significant costs and may constrain our expansion opportunities. our operations, both in the u.s. and internationally, are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing the generation, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances, waste disposal, air emissions, water discharges, remediation, restoration and reclamation of environmental contamination, including oil spill cleanup, mine closure and well plug and abandonment requirements, protection of endangered and protected species, and other related matters. in addition, we must obtain regulatory permits and approvals to start, continue and expand operations. laws such as cercla and similar state laws may subject us to joint and several liability for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of properties we acquired or are currently operating or at sites where we sent materials for processing, recycling or disposal. as discussed in more detail in the next risk factor, we have substantial obligations for environmental remediation on mining properties previously owned or operated by freeport minerals corporation (fmc) and certain of its affiliates. some of our onshore california oil and gas fields have been in operation for more than 100 years, and current or future legal requirements may require substantial expenditures to remediate the properties or to otherwise comply with these requirements. noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in material penalties or other liabilities. in addition, compliance with these laws may from time to time result in delays in or changes to our development or expansion plans. compliance with these laws and regulations imposes substantial costs, which we expect will continue to increase over time because of increased regulatory oversight, adoption of increasingly stringent environmental standards, as well as other factors. 55 table of contents new or revised environmental legal requirements are frequently proposed, many of which result in substantially increased costs for our business. for example, the epa has recently promulgated rules that could result in the reclassification of some mineral processing materials as "hazardous waste" under the federal resource conservation and recovery act and subject the industry to significant new and costly waste management requirements. we are seeking clarification of how those rules might affect our u.s. copper and molybdenum processing and recycling activities. other regulations under consideration by environmental regulatory agencies include provisions that would impose additional restrictions on waterway discharges and land use, regulate environmental impacts of radioactive materials associated with mining operations, and expand regulation of solid wastes, among other things. regulations are being considered at various governmental levels to increase regulation of or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. adoption of these or similar new environmental regulations or more stringent application of existing regulations may materially increase our costs and constrain our expansion opportunities. during 2014 , we incurred environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs (including our joint venture partners' shares) to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations that affect our operations of $405 million , compared with $595 million in 2013 and $612 million in 2012 . for 2015 , we expect to incur approximately $500 million of aggregate environmental capital expenditures and other environmental costs. the timing and amounts of estimated payments could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements, changes in scope and costs of reclamation and plug and abandonment activities, the settlement of environmental matters and the rate at which actual spending occurs. we incur significant costs for remediating environmental conditions on mining properties that have not been operated in many years. fmc and its subsidiaries, and many of their affiliates and predecessor companies have been involved in exploration, mining, milling, smelting and manufacturing in the u.s. for more than a century. activities that occurred in the late 19th century and the 20th century prior to the advent of modern environmental laws were not subject to environmental regulation and were conducted before american industrial companies fully understood the long-term effects of their operations on the surrounding environment. with the passage of cercla in 1980, companies like fmc became legally responsible for the remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment from properties owned or operated by them, including damages to natural resources, irrespective of when the damage to the environment occurred or who caused it. that liability is often shared on a joint and several basis with all other prior and subsequent owners and operators, meaning that each owner or operator of the property is fully responsible for the remediation, although in many cases some or all of the other historical owners or operators no longer exist, do not have the financial ability to respond or cannot be found. as a result, because of our acquisition of fmc in 2007, many of the subsidiary companies we now own are responsible for a wide variety of environmental remediation projects throughout the u.s., and we expect to spend substantial sums annually for many years to address those remediation issues. we are also subject to claims where the release of hazardous substances is alleged to have damaged natural resources. at december 31, 2014 , we had more than 100 active remediation projects (including damaged natural resource claims) in 27 u.s. states. in addition, fmc and certain affiliates and predecessor companies were parties to agreements relating to the transfer of businesses or properties, which contained indemnification provisions relating to environmental matters, and which from time to time become the source of claims against us. at december 31, 2014 , we had $1.2 billion recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for environmental obligations attributable to cercla or analogous state programs and for estimated future costs associated with environmental matters at closed facilities or closed portions of certain operating facilities. our environmental obligation estimates are primarily based upon: our knowledge and beliefs about complex scientific and historical facts and circumstances that in many cases occurred many decades ago; our beliefs and assumptions regarding the nature, extent and duration of remediation activities that we will be required to undertake and the estimated costs of those remediation activities, which are subject to varying interpretations; and 56 table of contents our beliefs regarding the requirements that are imposed on us by existing laws and regulations and, in some cases, the clarification of uncertain regulatory requirements that could materially affect our environmental obligation estimates. significant adjustments to these estimates are likely to occur in the future as additional information becomes available. the actual environmental costs may exceed our current and future accruals for these costs, and any such changes could be material. in addition, remediation standards for environmental media imposed by the epa and state environmental agencies have generally become more stringent over time and may become more stringent in the future. imposition of more stringent remediation standards poses a risk that additional remediation work could be required at sites that we have already remediated to the satisfaction of the responsible governmental agencies, and may increase the risk of toxic tort litigation. refer to note 12 for further discussion of our environmental obligations. our indonesia mining operations create difficult and costly environmental challenges, and future changes in environmental laws, or unanticipated environmental impacts from those operations, could require us to incur increased costs. mining operations on the scale of our indonesia operations involve significant environmental risks and challenges. our primary challenge is to dispose of the large amount of crushed and ground rock material, called tailings, that results from the process by which we physically separate the copper-, gold- and silver-bearing materials from the ore that we mine. our tailings management plan, which has been approved by the indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the highlands near our mine to transport the tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and natural sediments are managed in a deposition area. lateral levees have been constructed to help contain the footprint of the tailings and to limit their impact in the lowlands. another major environmental challenge is managing overburden, which is the rock that must be moved aside in the mining process to reach the ore. in the presence of air, water and naturally occurring bacteria, some overburden can generate acid rock drainage, or acidic water containing dissolved metals that, if not properly managed, can adversely affect the environment. in addition, overburden stockpiles are subject to erosion caused by the large amounts of rainfall, with the eroded stockpile material eventually being deposited in the lowlands tailing management area; this additional material, while predicted in our environmental studies, could influence the deposition of finer tailing material in the estuary. from time to time, certain indonesian government officials have raised questions with respect to our tailings and overburden management plans, including a suggestion that we implement a pipeline system rather than the river transport system for tailings management and disposition. because our indonesia mining operations are remotely located in steep mountainous terrain and in an active seismic area, a pipeline system would be costly, difficult to construct and maintain, and more prone to catastrophic failure, and could therefore involve significant potentially adverse environmental issues. based on our own studies and others conducted by third parties, we do not believe that a pipeline system is necessary or practical. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change issues may increase our costs and adversely affect our operations. many scientists believe that emissions from the combustion of carbon-based fuels contribute to greenhouse effects and, therefore, contribute to climate change. carbon-based energy is a significant input in our operations, and our revenues include significant sales of oil, ngls and gas, and other carbon-based energy products. the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain, and would vary by operation based on particular geographic circumstances. a number of governments have introduced or are contemplating regulatory initiatives designed to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. in the u.s., the epa has proposed regulations governing greenhouse gas emissions from new, modified, and existing power plants. increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs and may also affect the demand for the oil and gas we produce. 57 table of contents other risks our holding company structure may impact our ability to service debt and our stockholders ' ability to receive dividends . we are a holding company with no material assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. as a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, loan, debt repayment or otherwise. our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to make funds available to us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. dividends from subsidiaries that are not wholly owned are shared with other equity owners. cash at our international operations is also subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation into the u.s. in addition, our subsidiaries may not be able to, or be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to repay our indebtedness or pay dividends. each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal restrictions, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries, may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. our rights to participate in any distribution of our subsidiaries' assets upon their liquidation, reorganization or insolvency would generally be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries' creditors, including any trade creditors. anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. these provisions: authorize our board of directors (the board) to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us; establish advance notice requirements for nominations to the board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings; limit removal of directors for cause only; limit who may call stockholder meetings; and require the approval of the holders of two thirds of our outstanding common stock to enter into certain business combination transactions, subject to certain exceptions, including if the consideration to be received by our common stockholders in the transaction is deemed to be a fair price. these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the board. in addition, because we are incorporated in delaware, we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us. these provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to stockholders.
