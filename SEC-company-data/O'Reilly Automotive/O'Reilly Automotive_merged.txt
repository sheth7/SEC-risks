quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december 31, 2003, we had floating rate obligations totaling approximately $20.0 million for amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and long-term debt. these floating rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short-term rates. if the floating interest rate were to increase by 100 basis points (or 1%) from december 31, 2003 levels, our interest expense would increase by a total of approximately $16,667 per month.quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have any material amounts outstanding under our senior revolving line of credit, rely on foreign currencies or purchase raw materials or other commodities. accordingly, we currently do not experience material levels of market risk.risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based on the information available to us that later may prove to be material. you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forward-looking statements. the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive. both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive. for a list of our principal competitors, see the ''competition'' section of item 1 of this form 10-k. we cannot assure future growth will be achieved. we believe that our ability to open additional stores at an accelerated rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2006 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the ''growth and expansion strategies'' section of item 1 of this form 10-k. risks associated with acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth to differ from our expectations. for example: we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; our management attention may be distracted; we may fail to retain key acquired personnel; we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (account and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits; and we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, as a successor owner or operator, may be liable. we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our sales. all of our stores are located in the central, midwest and southern united states. in particular, approximately 27% of our stores are located in texas. therefore, our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. unusually inclement weather has historically reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. we depend on certain key and other personnel to successfully manage and grow our business. our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel, including david o'reilly, ted wise, greg henslee and jim batten. our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals. additionally, the successful implementation and management of our growth and expansion strategies will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract such qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient and reduce our sales. for a further discussion of our management and personnel, see the ''business'' section of item 1 and item 4a of this form 10-k and our proxy statement on schedule 14a for the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders, a portion of which is incorporated herein. 12 if the o'reilly family acts together, they will be a significant factor in a shareholder vote. as of the date of this form 10-k, the o'reilly family beneficially owns approximately 7%, or 8,020,205 shares, of the outstanding shares of our common stock. as a result, the o'reilly family, if they act together, represents one of the largest known blocks of our shares and may continue to be a significant factor in any matter voted on by our shareholders, including the election of our directors and any merger, sale of assets or other change in control. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based on general economic and market conditions. the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations. failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has

such a company. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business. sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price. all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule. we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a policy, we do not engage in speculative or derivative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities. based on our outstanding long-term debt balance at december 31, 2005, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our

of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unawa re, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission co uld have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements. 14 deteriorating e conomic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in recent years, w orldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the united states, and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future. although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. many of these factors are outside of our control. our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. if any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the u.s., the total number of registered vehicles the u.s., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the u.s. adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions. also , the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. if third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive. both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are l arger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competit ors are smaller than we are , but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive. for a list of our principal competitors, see the competition section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales. o ur business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our cu stomers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts. in addition, our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. we cannot assure future growth will be achieved. we believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our a bility to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 201 3 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the growth strategy section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees. our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees. experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense . we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which cou ld cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. for a discussion of our management, see the business section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. 15 a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect ou r financial health. our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms. for example, financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them. in addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to les competition and result in higher prices. we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them. risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following: we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; our management attention may be distracted; we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses; we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire t o realize economic, operational and other benefits; and we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, the subsequent owner or operator, may be liable. business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business. weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters or the threat of them, may result in the closure of our distribution centers ( dc s) or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis. this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events. if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions. such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business . we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry. we believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse affects on our business or team members. sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price. all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amende d, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule. we cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perce ption that such sale might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, could affect our stock price. we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fa il to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfull y meet the expectati ons of these analysts. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our business would likely suffer. 16 the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations. failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our bus iness. our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. we have in place , a n un secured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health. for example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things : make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the notes and our credit facility; increas e our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements; limit our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all; and expos e us to fluctuations in interest rates. in addition, the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees . a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs. credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital. the evaluations are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates . a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility. a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. in addition, a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates. decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business adversely affecting our cash flow. a breach of customer , team member or c ompany information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation. our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team member s. we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing , and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches , and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition . l itigation, governmental proceedings , environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings , arising out of the ordinary course of our business. the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition . environmental legislation and regulations, like the i nitiativ es to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change , could a dversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change 17 related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, including, among other things, increasing fuel prices. our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and to look for opportunities to reduce costs. our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as minimum wage legislation. a violation of or change in such laws and/or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the enacted patient protection and affordable care act, as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislators , could significantly impact our healthcare cost structure and increase our healthcare -related expenses . we are currently evaluating the potential impact the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate the impacts , including potential modifications to our current benefit plans, operational changes to minimize the impact of the legislation to our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcare-related expenses. i f we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation , our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility. historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates, however, as of december 31, 2012, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.10 billion and $0.80 billion as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.20 billion and $0.85 billion as of december 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices. we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. as of december 31 , 201 2 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $ 248 million . 42risk factors 14 risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements. deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in recent years, worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the united states, and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future. although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. many of these factors are outside of our control. our customers' purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. if any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the u.s., the total number of registered vehicles in the u.s., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the u.s. adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities. also, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. if third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 14 the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive. both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive. for a list of our principal competitors, see the competition section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales. our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions and natural disasters. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers' automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts. in addition, our stores and dcs located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. we cannot assure future growth will be achieved. we believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2014 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the growth strategy section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees. our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees. experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. for a discussion of our management, see the business section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health. our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms. for example, financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them. in addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them. risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following: we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; our management's attention may be distracted; we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses; we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits; and we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, the subsequent owner or operator, may be liable. 15 business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business. weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers ( dcs ) or other facilities or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis. this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events. if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions. such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business. we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry. we believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members. sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price. all of the shares of our common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule. we cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. we believe sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price. we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of acquired businesses will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations. failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business. our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. we have in place an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health. for example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things: make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the notes and our credit facility; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements; limit our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all; and expose us to fluctuations in interest rates. 16 in addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes as well as limit our access to attractive vendor financing programs. credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital. these ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates. a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility. a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. in addition, a downgrade could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our vendor financing programs at attractive rates. decreased participation in our vendor financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flow. a breach of customer, team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation. our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team members. we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental legislation and regulations and employment laws and regulations may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices. our business is subject to employment laws and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs. our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation. a violation of or change in employment laws and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. healthcare reform legislation could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the enacted patient protection and affordable care act, as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislatures, significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcare-related expenses. we are currently evaluating the potential additional impact the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impact, including potential further modifications to our current benefit plans, operational changes to minimize the effect of the legislation on our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcare-related expenses. if we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted. quantitative and qualitative disclosures

healthcare-related expenses. we continue to evaluate potential additional impacts the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impact, including potential further modifications to our current benefit plans, operational changes to minimize the effect of the legislation on our cost structure and increases to selling prices to mitigate the expected increase in healthcare-related expenses. if we cannot effectively modify our programs and operations in response to the new legislation, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2014 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 36 we had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.40 billion and $1.40 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.53 billion and $1.41 billion as of december 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices. we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. as of december 31, 2014 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $251 million . 37risk factors 13 risk factors unless otherwise indicated, "we," "us," "our" and similar terms, as well as references to the "company," refer to o'reilly automotive, inc. and its subsidiaries. our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements. deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. many of these factors are outside of our control. our customers' purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. if any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the u.s., the total number of registered vehicles in the u.s., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the u.s. adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial 13 institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities. furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. if third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive. both the do-it-yourself ("diy") and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive. for a list of our principal competitors, see the "competition" section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales. our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, and natural disasters. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers' automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts. in addition, our stores and distribution centers ("dcs") located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. we cannot assure future growth will be achieved. we believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2016 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the "growth strategy" section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees. our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees. experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. for a discussion of our management, see the "business" section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health. our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms. for example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them. in addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to, or difficulties in the, manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them. risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following: we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms. our management's attention may be distracted. we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses. we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems. 14 we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits. we may fail, or be unable to, discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, the subsequent owner or operator, may be liable. business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business. weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis. this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events. if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions. such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business. we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry. we believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based, in large part, on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members. risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price. we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business. our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health. for example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the senior unsecured notes and our credit facility; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements; limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms, if at all; and 15 expose us to fluctuations in interest rates. in addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs. credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital. these ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates. a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our credit facility. a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. in addition, a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates. decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows. a breach of customer, team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation. our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and team members. we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action. the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental legislation and regulations, employment legislation and regulations and healthcare reform legislation may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices. our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs. our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation. a violation of, or change in, employment legislation and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the enacted patient protection and affordable care act, as well as other healthcare reform legislation considered by congress and state legislatures, significantly impacts our healthcare cost structure and increases our healthcare-related expenses. we continue to evaluate potential additional impacts the healthcare reform legislation will have on our business and the steps necessary to mitigate such impacts. if we cannot effectively mitigate the potential additional impacts of the healthcare reform legislation, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely impacted. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 37 quantitative

and qualitative disclosures about market risk unless otherwise indicated, we, us, our and similar terms, as well as references to the company or o'reilly, refer to o'reilly automotive, inc. and its subsidiaries. we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2016 , we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we had outstanding fixed rate debt of $1.90 billion and $1.40 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $1.98 billion and $1.47 billion as of december 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices. we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. as of december 31, 2016 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $147 million . 40risk factors 15 risk factors unless otherwise indicated, we, us, our and similar terms, as well as references to the company, refer to o'reilly automotive, inc. and its subsidiaries. our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in our forward-looking statements. deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others, with which we do business, to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment levels and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. many of these factors are outside of our control. our customers' purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions or political uncertainty. in addition, restrictions on access to telematics, diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulations may force vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs. if any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. overall demand for products sold in the automotive aftermarket is dependent upon many factors including the total number of vehicle miles driven in the u.s., the total number of registered vehicles in the u.s., the age and quality of these registered vehicles and the level of unemployment in the u.s. adverse changes in these factors could lead to a decreased level of demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions that are counterparties to our credit facilities. furthermore, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. if third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. both the do-it-yourself ( diy ) and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. online and mobile platforms may allow customers to quickly compare prices and product assortments between us and a range of competitors, which could result in pricing pressure. some online competitors may have a lower cost structure than we do, as a result of our strategy of providing an exceptional in-store experience and superior parts availability supported by our extensive store network and robust, regional distribution footprint, which could also create pricing pressure. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. for a list of our principal competitors, see the competition section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could impact our costs and sales. our business is sensitive to national and regional economic and weather conditions, and natural disasters. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. extreme weather conditions, such as extreme heat and extreme cold temperatures, may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers' automotive parts, while temperate weather conditions may have a lesser impact on failure rates of automotive parts. in addition, our stores and distribution centers ( dcs ) located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 15 we cannot assure future growth will be achieved. we believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning, and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2018 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the growth strategy section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees. our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees. experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. our business, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient and, as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. for a discussion of our management, see the business section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. a change in the relationship with any of our key suppliers, the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices or changes in trade policies could affect our financial health. our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers' ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms. for example, financial or operational difficulties that our suppliers may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them. in addition, the trend toward consolidation among automotive parts suppliers, as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries, may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to, or difficulties in the, manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them. changes in u.s. trade policies, practices, tariffs or taxes could affect our ability and our suppliers' ability to source product at current volumes and/or prices. risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following: we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms. our management's attention may be distracted. we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses. we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems. we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits. we may fail, or be unable to, discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we or the subsequent owner or operator may be liable. business interruptions in our distribution centers or other facilities may affect our store hours, operability of our computer systems, and/or availability and distribution of merchandise, which may affect our business. weather, terrorist activities, war or other disasters, or the threat of them, may result in the closure of one or more of our dcs or other facilities, or may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory to our stores on a nightly basis. this may affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers, resulting in lost sales or a potential loss of customer loyalty. some of our merchandise is imported from other countries and these goods could become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states, and we may not be able to obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar prices. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and timely provide products to our customers. our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or other catastrophic events. if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process customer transactions. such a disruption of our systems could negatively impact revenue and potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 16 failure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality may reduce our brand value and negatively impact our business. we believe our company has built an excellent reputation as a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry. we believe our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brand. brand value is based, in large part, on perceptions of subjective qualities and even isolated incidents can erode trust and confidence, particularly if they result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, which can negatively impact these perceptions and lead to adverse effects on our business or team members. risks related to us and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect our stock price. we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our growth plans and business strategies will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our stock price would likely suffer. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. the market price of our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts' expectations and failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management's attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business. our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. we have an unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health. for example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things, make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the senior unsecured notes and our credit facility; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements; limit our ability to incur additional debt with acceptable terms, if at all; and expose us to fluctuations in interest rates. in addition, the terms of our financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative, negative and financial covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes, as well as limit our access to attractive supplier financing programs. credit ratings are an important component of our cost of capital. these ratings are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at favorable rates. a downgrade in our current credit rating from either rating agency could adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our unsecured revolving credit facility and a higher facility fee on commitments under our unsecured revolving credit facility. a downgrade in our current credit rating could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our unsecured senior notes, preventing a holder from selling the unsecured senior notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. in addition, a downgrade in our current credit rating could limit the financial institutions willing to commit funds to our supplier financing programs at attractive rates. decreased participation in our supplier financing programs would lead to an increase in working capital needed to operate the business, adversely affecting our cash flows. 17 a breach of customer, supplier, team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation. our business involves the storage of information about our customers, suppliers, team members and the company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. we and our third-party service providers and vendors have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, these security measures may be breached due to cyber-attacks, team member error, system compromises, fraud, hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts, which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action. in addition, the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our third-party service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices. our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs. our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation. a violation of, or change in, employment legislation and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the taxation of business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. in december 2017, comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ), was enacted and the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex. the final transition impacts of the tax act may differ materially from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the tax act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act, any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act, or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts. as these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk unless otherwise indicated, we, us, our and similar terms, as well as references to the company or o'reilly, refer to o'reilly automotive, inc. and its subsidiaries. we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2017 , we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the amount of $346 million , at the weighted-average variable interest rate of 2.675% . at this borrowing level, a 0.25% increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows in the amount of $0.9 million . we had outstanding fixed rate debt of $2.65 billion and $1.90 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $2.73 billion and $1.98 billion as of december 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices. we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. as of december 31, 2017 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $46 million . 41risk factors 15 risk factors unless otherwise indicated, we, us, our and

cash flows. a breach of customer, supplier, team member or company information could damage our reputation or result in substantial additional costs or possible litigation. our business involves the storage of information about our customers, suppliers, team members and the company, some of which is entrusted to third-party service providers and vendors. we and our third-party service providers and vendors have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information; however, these security measures may be breached due to cyber-attacks, team member error, system compromises, fraud, hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts, which could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to such information. the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time. if we experience a significant data security breach, we could be exposed to damage to our reputation, additional costs, lost sales or possible regulatory action. in addition, the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly evolving and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. there is no guarantee that the procedures that we and our third-party service providers and vendors have implemented to protect against unauthorized access to secured data are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, and such a breach could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. litigation, governmental proceedings, environmental legislation and regulations and employment legislation and regulations may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are, and in the future may become, involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings, arising out of the ordinary course of our business. the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings may be material and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. environmental legislation and regulations, like the initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change, could adversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these initiatives will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming and these matters, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, by, among other things, increasing fuel prices. our business is subject to employment legislation and regulations, including requirements related to minimum wage. our success depends, in part, on our ability to manage operating costs and identify opportunities to reduce costs. our ability to meet labor needs, while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as minimum wage legislation. a violation of, or change in, employment legislation and/or regulations could hinder our ability to control costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the taxation of business activities, the adoption of other corporate tax reform policies, or changes in tax legislation or policies may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the company is subject to taxation in the u.s. in december 2017, comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the u.s. tax cuts and jobs act (the tax act ), was enacted and the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex. as tax laws and related regulations and interpretations change, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk unless otherwise indicated, we, us, our and similar terms, as well as references to the company or o'reilly, refer to o'reilly automotive, inc. and its subsidiaries. we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ) with variable interest rates based on either an alternative base rate or adjusted libo rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility. as of december 31, 2018 , we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the amount of $287 million , at the weighted-average variable interest rate of 4.560% . at this borrowing level, a 0.50% increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable annual impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows in the amount of $1.4 million . we had outstanding fixed rate debt of $3.15 billion and $2.65 billion as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. the fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $3.12 billion and $2.73 billion as of december 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices. we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. as of december 31, 2018 , our cash and cash equivalents totaled $31 million . 40risk factors 14 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forward-looking statements. current economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. worldwide economic conditions have recently deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the united states, and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. although demand for many of our products is non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on discretionary spending by our customers. discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. many of these factors are outside of our control. our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. if any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue to challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers of finished goods, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions. in addition, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. if third parties on which we rely for finished goods are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and provide us with the materials we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities or interest rate swap transactions do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. 14 the integration of the operations of csk involves risks, and the failure to successfully integrate the operations or in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results of the combined company. the failure of the company to meet the challenges involved in integrating the operations of csk successfully or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could seriously harm our results of operations. our ability to realize the benefits of the acquisition will depend, in part, on the timely integration of organizations, operations, procedures, policies and technologies, as well as the successful adoption of the o reilly culture and the retention of key personnel. the integration of csk will be a complex, time-consuming and expensive process that, even with proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt the company business. the challenges involved in this integration include the following: implementing o reilly distribution, point of sale and inventory management systems; combining respective product offerings; preserving customer, supplier and other important relationships of both o reilly and csk and resolving potential conflicts that may arise; minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns; contingencies that may arise of which we were not aware or of which we underestimated the significance; addressing differences in the business cultures of o reilly and csk to maintain employee morale and retain key employees; and coordinating and combining geographically diverse operations, relationships and facilities, which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by distance and local laws and regulations. we may not successfully integrate the operations of csk in a timely manner, or not at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of the merger to the extent, or in the time frame, anticipated. the anticipated benefits and synergies are based on projections and assumptions, not actual experience, and assume a successful integration. in addition to the integration risks discussed above, our ability to realize these benefits and synergies could be adversely affected by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations. if we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger. our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. in conjunction with the acquisition of csk, we entered into a new credit facility, which significantly increased our outstanding indebtedness and debt service requirements. our substantial debt could have important consequences, such as: requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to principal and interest, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other cash requirements; increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; limiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all; and exposing us to fluctuations in interest rates. in addition, the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions to borrowing, subsidiary guarantees and asset and stock pledges. a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations. for example: we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; 15 our management attention may be distracted; we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses; we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits; and we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, as a successor owner or operator, may be liable. the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive. both the diy and professional installer portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competitors are smaller than we are overall but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive. for a list of our principal competitors, see the competition section of item 1 of this form 10-k. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees, which may be more difficult in light of uncertainty created by the acquisition of csk, and failure to do so could seriously harm the company. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees. experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. employee retention may be a particularly challenging issue in connection with the integration of the acquired csk operations. we also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals, which may be particularly difficult due to the potential distractions of the merger. we cannot assure future growth will be achieved. we believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2009 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the growth and expansion strategies section of item 1 of this form 10-k. we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our sales. approximately 30% of our stores are located in texas and california. therefore, our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. potential indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance could adversely affect us. as discussed in item 3, legal proceedings and note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, several of csk former directors or officers and current or former employees have been or may be interviewed as part of or become the subject of criminal, administrative and civil investigations and lawsuits. we are involved in working toward resolution of these matters involving such persons. under delaware law, the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements, we may have an obligation to indemnify and are currently incurring expenses on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters. some of these indemnification obligations may not be covered by our directors and officers insurance policies. if we incur significant uninsured indemnity obligations in the future, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price. all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule. we cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. 16 risks related to the company and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could affect the company stock price. we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future operating results of the company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of csk will be successful or that it will successfully manage these risks. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our business would likely suffer. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations. failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates. at december 31, 2007, we did not have amounts borrowed against our variable rate credit facilities and, as a result, did not have material market risk exposure. primarily as a result of borrowings in 2008 to fund the acquisition of csk, we have interest rate exposure with respect to the $614 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december 31, 2008; however, from time to time, we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure. on july 24, 2008, october 14, 2008, and november 24, 2008, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts ( the swaps ) with a total notional amount of $450 million. the swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. 36 if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $1.6 million ($1.0 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps. this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates. in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. 37risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in these

and sales. approximately 30% of our stores are located in texas and california. therefore, our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. in addition, our stores located in these coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. legal proceedings and related matters arising from csk could adversely affect us. as discussed in item 3, legal proceedings and note 14 legal matters of the consolidated financial statements, several of csk former officers and employees have been charged by the department of justice ( doj ) and named in civil actions by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). o reilly has resolved csk pre-acquisition issues with the sec, but as set forth in item 3 and note 14 legal matters , the doj investigation continues and could result in criminal charges being filed against csk. we are involved in working toward resolution of these matters. under delaware law, the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements, csk has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and o reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to pending matters. there can be no assurance that the expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of these matters will be covered by csk directors and officers insurance policies. if we incur significant uninsured expenses in connection with the resolution of the matters described above, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price. all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule. we cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. we believe sales of substantial

of the future operating results of the company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of csk will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our business would likely suffer. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations. failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business. a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health. our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms. for example, financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them. in addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them. 16 table of contents complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect our business. we operate 21 distribution centers nationwide to support our business. if complications arise with any facility or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed, our other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands. this may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a nightly basis and therefore affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations, such as by increasing fuel prices, and therefore increase our operating costs. initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the u.s. congress, which could adversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming, and these mandates, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, including, among other things, increasing fuel prices. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates. primarily as a result of borrowings in 2008 to fund the acquisition of csk, we have interest rate exposure with respect to the $679 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december 31, 2009; however, from time to time, we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure. on july 24, 2008, october 14, 2008, and november 24, 2008, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts ( the swaps ) with a total notional amount of $450 million. the interest rate swap transaction we entered into with suntrust on november 24, 2008, was for $50 million and matured on november 28, 2009, increasing our exposure to changes in interest rates by $50 million, to a total notional amount of $400 million. on january 21, 2010, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with barclays on an additional $50 million of the company outstanding floating rate debt. the swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges. if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $2.8 million ($1.7 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps. this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates. in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our asset-based credit facility, management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. 39 table of contentsrisk factors 14 risk factors our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, there may also be risks of which we are currently unaware, or that we currently regard as immaterial based upon the information available to us that later may prove to be material. interested parties should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors, elsewhere in this form 10-k and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. actual results, therefore, may materially differ from anticipated results described in these forward-looking statements. deteriorating economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products, reduce access to credit and cause our customers and others with which we do business to suffer financial hardship, all of which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. in recent years, worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions, including the united states, and such conditions may worsen in the foreseeable future. although demand for many of our products is primarily non-discretionary in nature and tend to be purchased by consumers out of necessity, rather than on an impulse basis, our sales are impacted by constraints on the economic health of our customers. the economic health of our customers is affected by many factors, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates, taxation, fuel prices, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. many of these factors are outside of our control. our customers purchases, including purchases of our products, could decline during periods when income is lower, when prices increase in response to rising costs, or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. if any of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions challenge the consumer environment, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. in addition, economic conditions, including decreased access to credit, may result in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers, suppliers, logistics and other service providers and financial institutions which are counterparties to our credit facilities and interest rate swap transactions. also, the ability of these third parties to overcome these difficulties may increase. if third parties, on whom we rely for merchandise, are unable to overcome difficulties resulting from the deterioration in economic conditions and provide us with the merchandise we need, or if counterparties to our credit facilities do not perform their obligations, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. we cannot assure that the recently integrated csk stores will perform at the same desired level of profitability as historic o reilly stores. we expect acquired csk stores to approximate the profitability levels of our core o reilly stores, and believe this to be a significant factor in achieving our financial goals. the failure of these stores to attain these profitability levels could seriously impact our forecasted results of operations. our ability to operate these stores at our expected level will depend, in part, on the successful preservation of the existing diy customers already established in these markets, growing the commercial customer base, the adoption of the o reilly culture, along with maintaining employee morale and the retention of key personnel. we may not be able to obtain these profitability levels in our acquired csk stores as soon as we expect, or at all. if we fail to address the challenges of our new markets effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the merger. our increased debt levels could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations. we have in place, an unsecured credit facility and unsecured senior notes, which could have important consequences to our financial health. for example, our level of indebtedness could, among other things: make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the notes and our credit facility; increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service the principal and interest on the debt, reducing the funds available for other business purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures or other cash requirements; limit our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all; and expose us to fluctuations in interest rates. in addition, the terms of the financing obligations include restrictions, such as affirmative and negative covenants, conditions on borrowing and subsidiary guarantees. a failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under the financing 14 table of contents obligations or could require us to obtain waivers from our lenders for failure to comply with these restrictions. the occurrence of a default that remains uncured or the inability to secure a necessary consent or waiver could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. a downgrade in our credit rating would impact our cost of capital and could impact the market value of our unsecured senior notes. credit ratings are an important part of our cost of capital. we currently have a bbb- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard &amp; poor and a baa3 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moody investors service. the evaluations are based upon, among other factors, our financial strength. our current credit ratings provide us with the ability to borrow funds at a specific rate. a downgrade in our current credit rating from both agencies would adversely affect our cost of capital by causing us to pay a higher interest rate on borrowed funds under our credit facility. a downgrade could also adversely affect the market price and/or liquidity of our notes, preventing a holder from selling the notes at a favorable price, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue new notes in the future. risks associated with future acquisitions may not lead to expected growth and could result in increased costs and inefficiencies. we expect to continue to make acquisitions as an element of our growth strategy. acquisitions involve certain risks that could cause our actual growth and profitability to differ from our expectations, examples of such risks include the following: we may not be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition targets or to acquire additional companies at favorable prices or on other favorable terms; our management attention may be distracted; we may fail to retain key personnel from acquired businesses; we may assume unanticipated legal liabilities and other problems; we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations (accounting and billing functions, for example) of businesses we acquire to realize economic, operational and other benefits; and we may fail or be unable to discover liabilities of businesses that we acquire for which we, as a successor owner or operator, may be liable. the automotive aftermarket business is highly competitive, and we may have to risk our capital to remain competitive. both the diy and professional service provider portions of our business are highly competitive, particularly in the more densely populated areas that we serve. some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. in addition, some of our competitors are smaller than us, but have a greater presence than we do in a particular market. we may have to expend more resources and risk additional capital to remain competitive. for a list of our principal competitors, see the competition section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate key employees. our success has been largely dependent on the efforts of certain key personnel. in order to be successful, we will need to retain and motivate executives and other key employees. experienced management and technical personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. we must also continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals. our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key employees. we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to attract qualified personnel, which could cause us to be less efficient, and as a result, may adversely impact our sales and profitability. for a discussion of our management, see the business section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we cannot assure future growth will be achieved. we believe that our ability to open additional, profitable stores at a high growth rate will be a significant factor in achieving our growth objectives for the future. our ability to accomplish our growth objectives is dependent, in part, on matters beyond our control, such as weather conditions, zoning and other issues related to new store site development, the availability of qualified management personnel and general business and economic conditions. we cannot be sure that our growth plans for 2011 and beyond will be achieved. failure to achieve our growth objectives may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. for a discussion of our growth strategies, see the growth strategy section of item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. we are sensitive to regional economic and weather conditions that could reduce our costs and sales. approximately 29% of our stores are located in texas and california. therefore, our business is sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of those regions. unusually inclement weather, such as significant rain, snow, sleet, freezing rain, flooding, 15 table of contents seismic activity and hurricanes, has historically discouraged our customers from visiting our stores during the affected period and reduced our sales, particularly to diy customers. in addition, our stores located in coastal regions may be subject to increased insurance claims resulting from regional weather conditions and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. legal proceedings and related matters arising from csk could adversely affect us. as discussed in item 3, legal proceedings and note 14 legal matters to the consolidated financial statements, several of csk former officers and employees were charged by the department of justice ( doj ) and named in civil actions by the securities and exchange commission ( sec ). o reilly and the doj have agreed in principle, subject to final documentation, to resolve csk pre-acquisition issues with the doj. the pre-acquisition sec investigation of csk, which commenced in 2006, was settled in may of 2009 by administrative order without fines, disgorgement or other financial remedies. under delaware law, the charter documents of the csk entities and certain indemnification agreements, csk has certain obligations to indemnify these persons and, as a result, o reilly is currently incurring legal fees on the behalf of these persons in relation to certain matters. there can be no assurance that the expenses incurred in connection with the resolution of these matters will be covered by csk directors and officers insurance policies. if we incur significant uninsured expenses in connection with the resolution of the matters described above, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. sales of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect our share price. all of the shares of common stock currently held by our affiliates may be sold in reliance upon the exemptive provisions of rule 144 of the securities act of 1933, as amended, subject to certain volume and other conditions imposed by such rule. we cannot predict the effect, if any, which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on the market price of the common stock prevailing from time to time. we believe sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. risks related to the company and unanticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, could affect the company stock price. we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful indicators of the future operating results of the company and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance. if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected. we cannot be certain that our business strategy and our plans to integrate the operations of csk will be successful or that they will successfully meet the expectations of these analysts. if we fail to adequately address any of these risks or difficulties, our business would likely suffer. the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation. the stock market and the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon general economic and market conditions. the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations. failure to meet such expectations, even slightly, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. in addition, stock market volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. downturns in the stock market may cause the price of our common stock to decline. in the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. if similar litigation were instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our business. a change in the relationship with any of our key vendors or the unavailability of our key products at competitive prices could affect our financial health. our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms. many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms. for example, financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them. in addition, the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off-shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors, and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices. we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages, labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them. 16 table of contents complications in our distribution centers and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise may affect our business. we operate 23 distribution centers ( dc ) nationwide to support our business. if complications arise with any facility or if any facility is severely damaged or destroyed, our other dcs may not be able to fully support the resulting additional distribution demands. this may adversely affect our ability to deliver inventory on a nightly basis and therefore affect our ability to timely provide products to our customers resulting in lost sales. such a disruption in revenue could potentially have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. environmental legislation and regulations could affect our operations, such as by increasing fuel prices, and therefore increase our operating costs. initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions and bills related to climate change have been introduced in the u.s. congress, which could adversely impact all industries. while it is uncertain whether these will become law, additional climate change related mandates could potentially be forthcoming, and these mandates, if enacted, could adversely impact our costs, including, among other things, increasing fuel prices. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates. we had potential interest rate exposure with respect to the $356 million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december 31, 2010; however, from time to time, we had entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure. on july 24, 2008, october 14, 2008, november 24, 2008, and january 21, 2010, we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts ( the swaps ) with a total notional amount of $450 million. the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with bbt on july 24, 2008, for $100 million matured on august 1, 2010; the interest rate swap transaction that we entered into with bbt on october 14, 2008, for $25 million and was scheduled to mature on october 17, 2010, was terminated at our request on september 16, 2010; the interest rate swap transactions we entered into with bbt, ba and/or suntrust on october 14, 2008, totaling $75 million, matured on october 17, 2010, bringing the total notional amount of swapped debt to $250 million as of december 31, 2010. the swaps represented contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss. if interest rates increased or decreased by 100 basis points, annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately $1.1 million ($0.7 million after tax), based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps. this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates. in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our variable interest rate credit facilities, management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk. the interest rate contracts are derivative instruments which have been designated as cash flow hedges. we do not hold or issue derivative financials instruments for trading purposes. all of the interest rate swap transactions that existed as of december 31, 2010, for a total notional amount of $250 million, were terminated at the company request on january 14, 2011, concurrent with the closing and issuance of our 2011 4.875% senior notes. 41 table of contentsrisk factors 14 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the revolving credit facility ) with variable interest rates based on either a base rate or eurodollar rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility. historically, we had entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risks associated with borrowings against our previous credit facility with variable interest rates, however, as of december 31, 2011, we did not have any interest rate swap contracts and had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. we invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 30 days or less. we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. as of december 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $362 million. 41 table of contents
