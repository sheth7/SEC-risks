qualitative disclosures about market risk the information set forth under the caption "management's discussion and analysis - risk sensitivity" contained in the 2002 annual report to stockholders is incorporated in this item 7a by reference.risk factors 3 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in recent years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility, and this volatility is expected to continue. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products, disposable wipes and various health care products, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products do not adjust, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize substitutes with lower prices for these materials. 3 table of contents part i (continued) derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that we use all forms of energy cost-effectively, we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. increased pricing pressure, intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we compete in highly competitive markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitive actions. our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers, low-cost manufacturers and rapidly-expanding international manufacturers. some of these competitors may have increased access to financial resources and increased market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, allowing them to offer products at a lower cost. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect our financial results. in addition, we compete in highly competitive regional markets, such as in european personal care and tissue markets, as well as in other areas such as latin america, eastern europe, africa and asia. intense competition in these areas may slow our sales growth and earnings potential, as well as adversely impact our margins. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources. these competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. global and regional economic conditions, including recessions or slow economic growth, and continuing global and regional credit market volatility, could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. the global economy continues to be volatile, with particular regions such as europe facing uncertain or slow economic growth. these unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact: consumer demand for our products, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower-cost options such as private-label products, as well as declining birth rates in countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, demand by businesses for our products, including the effects of increased unemployment and cost savings efforts of customers, the social and political environment, the product mix of our sales, and our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers. 4 table of contents part i (continued) ongoing volatility in global and regional commodity, currency and financial markets, including in europe, has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment. we rely on access to credit markets, specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets, to provide supplemental funding for our operations. although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access credit markets, it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing credit markets in the future, which may disrupt our businesses or further increase our cost of funding our operations. prolonged global or regional recessions, slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue, margins and earnings. changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results. these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via e-commerce, as well as the growth of large-format retailers and discounters that exclusively sell private-label products. pending litigation, administrative actions, tax matters, regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect. as a global company, during the course of our business we are subject to various legal and administrative actions in which we assert our rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. we may not be successful in defending against these actions or in asserting these rights. in addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending against, or in asserting our rights in, these actions. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the united states and internationally. many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have volatile enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. aspects of our business, including health care, are subject to many laws and governmental regulations, including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies, as well as potential litigation. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. our sales and results of operations also may be adversely affected by new legal requirements, including healthcare reform legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements may not be as expected. see item 3, legal proceedings. if we are unable to hire, develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce, it could have an adverse effect on our business. our strategy includes a focus on hiring, developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce. a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation, as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base. we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills. we may not be able to successfully recruit, develop and retain the key personnel that we need. 5 table of contents part i (continued) unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions, or to hire and retain a diverse, skilled workforce, could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments. see our discussion of our cost savings activities in md&amp;a. if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans, however, we may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries, with products sold in more than 175 countries, our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. we are subject to the impact of economic, social and political instability in developing countries. we are exposed to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. in addition, we face increased risks in our international operations, including currency exchange restrictions and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s., adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, risks of expropriation, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and developing and maintaining successful business alliances, and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results. see md&amp;a and item 8, note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela. damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 6 table of contents part i (continued) moreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness, exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transactions costs, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. alternatively, we may periodically divest product lines or businesses, which may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses. in addition, businesses under consideration for divestiture may be adversely impacted, which could negatively affect our financial results. disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental, or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our vendors, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures, our business operations could be disrupted. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient operation of our business. this role includes ordering and managing materials from suppliers, managing our inventory, converting materials to finished products, facilitating order entry and fulfillment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting our results, facilitating internal and external communications, administering human resources functions, and providing other processes necessary to manage our business. the failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and negatively impact our results. in addition, these information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses, or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs. 26 table of contents part ii (continued) as of december 31, 2011 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $50 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2011 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the u.s. dollar. changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the u.s. dollar applied to our bolivar-denominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change. at december 31, 2011 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $13 million. there are no viable options for hedging this exposure. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2011 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $850 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2011 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2011 , the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 19 percent variable-rate debt and 81 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2011 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $194 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. 27 table of contents part ii (continued)risk factors 3 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2012 annual report products. in recent years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility, and this volatility is expected to continue. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products, disposable wipes and various health care products, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products do not adjust, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize substitutes with lower prices for these materials. generally derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. increased pricing pressure, intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we compete in highly competitive markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitive actions. our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers, low-cost manufacturers and rapidly-expanding international manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect our financial results. in addition, we compete in highly competitive regional markets, such as latin america, europe, africa and asia. intense competition in these areas may slow our sales growth and earnings potential, as well as adversely impact our margins. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. global and regional economic conditions, including recessions or slow economic growth, and continuing global and regional credit market volatility, could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. the global economy continues to be volatile, with particular regions facing uncertain or slow economic growth. these unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact: consumer demand for our products, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2012 annual report private-label products, as well as declining birth rates in countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, demand by businesses for our products, including the effects of increased unemployment and cost savings efforts of customers, the social and political environment, the product mix of our sales, and our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers. ongoing volatility in global and regional commodity, currency and financial markets has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment. we rely on access to credit markets, specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets, to provide supplemental funding for our operations. although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access credit markets, it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing credit markets in the future, which may disrupt our businesses or further increase our cost of funding our operations. prolonged global or regional recessions, slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue, margins and earnings. if we are unable to hire, develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce, it could have an adverse effect on our business. our strategy includes a focus on hiring, developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce. a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation, as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base. we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills. we may not be able to successfully recruit, develop and retain the key personnel that we need. unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions, or to hire and retain a diverse, skilled workforce, could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations. changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results. these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via e-commerce, as well as the growth of large-format retailers and discounters that exclusively sell private-label products. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries, with products sold in more than 175 countries, our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. we are subject to the impact of economic, social and political instability in developing countries. we are exposed to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2012 annual report in addition, we face increased risks in our international operations, including currency exchange restrictions and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s., adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, risks of expropriation, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and developing and maintaining successful business alliances, and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results. see md&amp;a and item 8, note 19 for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela. pending litigation, administrative actions, tax matters, regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, during the course of our business we are subject to various legal and administrative actions in which we assert our rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. we may not be successful in defending against these actions or in asserting these rights. in addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending against, or in asserting our rights in, these actions. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. aspects of our business, including health care and personal care, are subject to many laws and governmental regulations, including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies, as well as potential litigation. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, regulatory or other governmental investigation, or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. our sales and results of operations may also be adversely impacted by new legal requirements, including healthcare reform legislation, financial reform legislation and regulations, export control and foreign sanctions legislation, and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements may not be as expected. see item 3, "legal proceedings." damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments. see our discussion of our cost savings activities in md&amp;a. if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans, we may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. 6 kimberly-clark corporation - 2012 annual report disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental, or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our vendors, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. moreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness, exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transactional costs, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. alternatively, we may periodically divest product lines or businesses, such as in connection with the strategic changes we are making in our western and central european consumer and professional businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. in addition, businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively affect our financial results. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions or failures, our business operations could be disrupted. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient operation of our business. this role includes ordering and managing materials from suppliers, managing our inventory, converting materials to finished products, facilitating order entry and fulfillment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting our results, facilitating internal and external communications, administering human resources functions, and providing other processes necessary to manage our business. the failure of these information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and negatively impact our results. in addition, these information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses, or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. 7 kimberly-clark corporation - 2012 annual report quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 27 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs. as of december 31, 2012 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre-tax loss of approximately $60. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2012 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the u.s. dollar. changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the u.s. dollar applied to our bolivar-denominated net monetary asset position 27 kimberly-clark corporation - 2012 annual report are recorded in income at the time of the change. at december 31, 2012 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pre-tax loss of approximately $20. there are no viable options for hedging this exposure. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("uta") within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2012 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $900. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2012 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2012 , the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 16 percent variable-rate debt and 84 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2012 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $169. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pre-tax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, which are used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 28 kimberly-clark corporation - 2012 annual reportrisk factors 3 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in recent years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility, and this volatility is expected to continue. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products, disposable wipes and various health care products, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products do not adjust, if these adjustments significantly trail 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2013 annual report the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize substitutes with lower prices for these materials. generally, derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. increased pricing pressure, intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we compete in highly competitive markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitive actions. our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers, low-cost manufacturers and rapidly-expanding international manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect our financial results. in addition, we compete in highly competitive regional markets, such as latin america, europe, middle east, africa and asia. intense competition in these areas may slow our sales growth and earnings potential, as well as adversely impact our margins. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. global and regional economic conditions, including recessions or slow economic growth, and continuing global and regional credit market volatility, could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. the global economy continues to be volatile, with particular regions facing uncertain or slow economic growth. these unfavorable economic conditions could negatively impact: consumer demand for our products, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products, as well as declining birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, demand by businesses for our products, including the effects of increased unemployment and cost savings efforts of customers, the social and political environment, the product mix of our sales, and our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers. ongoing volatility in global and regional commodity, currency and financial markets has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment. we rely on access to credit markets, specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets, to provide 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2013 annual report supplemental funding for our operations. although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access credit markets, it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing credit markets in the future, which may disrupt our businesses or further increase the cost of funding our operations. prolonged global or regional recessions, slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue, margins and earnings. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries, with products sold in more than 175 countries, our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. we are subject to the impact of economic, social and political instability in developing countries. we are exposed to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. in addition, we face increased risks in our international operations, including currency exchange restrictions and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s., adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, risks of expropriation, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and developing and maintaining successful business alliances, and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results. see md&amp;a and item 8, note 1 for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. this role includes: ordering and managing materials from suppliers, managing our inventory, converting materials to finished products, facilitating order entry and fulfillment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting our results, facilitating internal and external communications, administering human resources functions, collecting and storing customer, vendor, employee and investor information and personal data, hosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans, and financial information, complying with regulatory, tax and other legal requirements, providing data security, and providing other processes necessary to manage our business. these information technology systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. any failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. any breach in our technology information security systems could result in the 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2013 annual report disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events. if we are unable to hire, develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce, it could have an adverse effect on our business. our strategy includes a focus on hiring, developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce. a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation, as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base. we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills. we may not be able to successfully recruit, develop and retain the key personnel that we need. unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions, or to hire and retain a diverse, skilled workforce, could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations. changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results. these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via e-commerce, as well as the growth of large-format retailers and discounters that exclusively sell private-label products. pending and potential future litigation, administrative actions, tax matters, regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, during the course of our business we are subject to various legal and administrative actions in which we assert our rights under various laws, including intellectual property and data privacy laws. we may not be successful in defending against these actions or in asserting these rights. in addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending against, or in asserting our rights in, these actions. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. aspects of our business, including health care and personal care, are subject to many laws and governmental regulations, including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies, as well as potential litigation. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, regulatory or other governmental investigation, or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. our sales and results of operations may also be adversely impacted by new legal requirements, including healthcare reform legislation, excise or other taxes, financial reform legislation and regulations, export control and foreign sanctions legislation, and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements may not be as expected. see item 3, "legal proceedings." 6 kimberly-clark corporation - 2013 annual report damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments. see our discussion of our cost savings activities in md&amp;a. if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans, we may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our vendors, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. moreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness, exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transactional costs, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. alternatively, we may periodically divest product lines or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. in addition, businesses under consideration for or otherwise subject to divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively affect our financial results. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products. 7 kimberly-clark corporation - 2013 annual report the proposed spin-off of our health care business may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, if at all. in november 2013, we announced our intention to pursue a potential tax-free spin-off of our health care business. execution of the proposed spin-off will require, among other things, (i) obtaining final approval from our board of directors, (ii) filing a registration statement on form 10 with the sec, (iii) obtaining an opinion of counsel that the transaction will qualify for tax-free treatment under irs regulations and (iv) obtaining an opinion from a nationally-recognized investment banking firm or other authority confirming the viability and solvency of the new health care company after the distribution. unforeseen circumstances could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the proposed spin-off, including possible issues or delays in obtaining the required regulatory approvals or clearances, disruptions in capital and financial markets or other potential barriers. therefore, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spin-off under the expected plans or anticipated timeline, if at all. the proposed spin-off of our health care business will require significant expenditures and attention of management and may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition and, if completed, may not achieve the intended results. we anticipate incurring significant expenses in connection with the proposed spin-off. in addition, completion of the proposed spin-off will require significant amounts of our management's time and effort which could divert management's attention from operating and growing our businesses and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. if the proposed spin-off is completed, our operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the health care business from our other businesses. as a result, our diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be negatively impacted. additionally, after the spin-off, we may not be able to achieve our historical levels of synergies or cost savings, which could result in higher cost allocation to our remaining segments. the proposed spin-off of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders. historically, the irs has provided companies seeking to perform a tax-free spin-off transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spin-off transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment. however, last year the irs announced that it would no longer provide such advance rulings. prior to completing the spin-off of our health care business, we expect to receive an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our shareholders will recognize any taxable income, gain or loss for u.s. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off. however, this opinion will not be binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. moreover, the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us, which, if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, could invalidate the opinion of counsel. if the spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. in addition, if the spin-off were taxable, each holder of our common stock who receives shares of the new health care company would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative

is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. as of december 31, 2013 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre-tax loss of approximately $25, excluding the effect of an unfavorable change in the venezuelan bolivar discussed below. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2013 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 28 kimberly-clark corporation - 2013 annual report our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the u.s. dollar. changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the u.s. dollar applied to our bolivar-denominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change. at december 31, 2013 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pre-tax loss of approximately $30. there are no viable options for hedging this exposure. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("uta") within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. as of december 31, 2013 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $900. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2013 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2013 , the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 15 percent variable-rate debt and 85 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2013 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $195. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pre-tax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, which are used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 29 kimberly-clark corporation - 2013 annual reportrisk factors 3 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual report better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results. we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions or changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. our strategy includes growing our operations outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, latin america and eastern europe. more than half of our net sales are generated from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries, with products sold in more than 175 countries. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks: exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences would adversely affect our financial results. the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see recent developments, md&amp;a and item 8, note 1 for information about the effects of currency restrictions and related exposures in venezuela. increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual report such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results. these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via e-commerce, as well as the growth of large-format retailers and discounters that exclusively sell private-label products. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in recent years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility, and this volatility is expected to continue. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials. generally, we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . we operate on a global scale and therefore our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our vendors, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual report reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. if we cannot successfully implement our cost saving and restructuring plans, we may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. in october 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan in order to improve organization efficiency and offset the impact of stranded overhead costs resulting from the spin-off of our health care business. the successful implementation of this program presents significant organizational challenges, including successfully managing the relationship with halyard, and we may not be able to realize all of the expected benefits of the program. any failure to implement our restructuring plan in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. new or revised future legal or regulatory requirements, potential litigation or administrative actions, or tax matters could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations, including regulations by the u.s. food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions. additionally, our sales and results of operations may be adversely impacted by new or revised legal requirements, including excise or other taxes, financial reform legislation and regulations, export control and foreign sanctions legislation, and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, regulatory or other governmental investigation, or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal or income tax requirements may not be as expected. damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, the distribution and sale of counterfeit products, or a failure or breach of our information technology systems. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee or investor 6 kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual report information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events. we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we periodically divest product lines or businesses, including the current year spin-off of our health care business. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, mitigate corporate overhead costs allocated to those businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products. we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. the spin-off of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders. historically, the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spin-off transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spin-off transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment. however, the irs no longer provides such advance rulings. prior to completing the spin-off of our health care business, we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our u.s. shareholders will recognize taxable income, gain or loss for u.s. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off. the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us, which, if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, could invalidate the opinion of counsel. in addition, this opinion is not binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. if the spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. in addition, if the spin-off were deemed taxable, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 25 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. 25 kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual report as of december 31, 2014 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre-tax loss of approximately $35 , excluding the effect of an unfavorable change in the venezuelan bolivar discussed below. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2014 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the u.s. dollar. changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the u.s. dollar applied to our bolivar-denominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change. at december 31, 2014 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pre-tax loss of approximately $5 . there are no viable options for hedging this exposure. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("uta") within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. as of december 31, 2014 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $800 . these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2014 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2014 , the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 27 percent variable-rate debt and 73 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2014 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $176 , which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pre-tax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, which are used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 26 kimberly-clark corporation - 2014 annual reportrisk factors 3 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, latin america and eastern europe. more than half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries, and sell products in more than 175 countries. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks: exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries. adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences would adversely affect our financial results. 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2015 annual report the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see recent developments, md&amp;a and item 8, note 1 for information about the impact on our operations from currency restrictions in venezuela and our decision to deconsolidate our venezuelan operations at december 31, 2015 . intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results. we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions or changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition. damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, the distribution and sale of counterfeit products, or a failure or breach of our information technology systems. increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2015 annual report adversely affected. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results. these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via e-commerce, as well as the growth of large-format retailers and discounters that exclusively sell private-label products. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials. generally, we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. new or revised legal or regulatory requirements, potential litigation or administrative actions, or tax matters could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions. additionally, our sales and results of operations may be adversely impacted by new or revised legal requirements, including excise or other taxes, financial reform legislation and regulations, export control and foreign sanctions legislation, and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, regulatory or other governmental investigation, or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions face budgetary shortfalls or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, the outcome of these proceedings may not be as expected. 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2015 annual report disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our vendors, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events. we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we periodically divest product lines or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products. we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. 6 kimberly-clark corporation - 2015 annual report the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. the 2014 spin-off of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders. on october 31, 2014, we completed the spin-off of our health care business, creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company, halyard health, inc. ("halyard"). historically, the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spin-off transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spin-off transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment. however, the irs no longer provides such advance rulings. prior to completing the spin-off of our health care business, we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our u.s. shareholders will recognize taxable income, gain or loss for u.s. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off. the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us, which, if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, could invalidate the opinion of counsel. in addition, this opinion is not binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. if the spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. in addition, if the spin-off were deemed taxable, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 28 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. 28 kimberly-clark corporation - 2015 annual report as of december 31, 2015 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31, 2015 rates and the assumed rates. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("uta") within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. as of december 31, 2015 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $700 . these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2015 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2015 , the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 29 percent variable-rate debt and 71 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2015 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $186 , which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pre-tax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 29 kimberly-clark corporation - 2015 annual reportrisk factors 3 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, latin america and eastern europe. about half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries, and sell products in more than 175 countries. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks: exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries. adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences would adversely affect our financial results. increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. the 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2016 annual report actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results. we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions or changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition. increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. in addition, the emergence of new sales channels may affect customer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results. these new channels include sales of consumer and other products via e-commerce, as well as the growth of large-format retailers and discounters that exclusively sell private-label products. damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, the distribution and sale of counterfeit products, or a failure or breach of our information technology systems. government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions. if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, regulatory or other governmental investigation, or product liability or other litigation may also adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2016 annual report although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, the outcome of these proceedings may not be as expected. in addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business, which could adversely impact our financial results. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials. new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect in our financial results. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies or are contemplating changes, or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our vendors, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials. generally, we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. our manufacturing operations

manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2016 annual report protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events. the 2014 spin-off of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders. on october 31, 2014, we completed the spin-off of our health care business, creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company, halyard health, inc. ("halyard"). historically, the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spin-off transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spin-off transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment. however, the irs no longer provides such advance rulings. prior to completing the spin-off of our health care business, we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our u.s. stockholders will recognize taxable income, gain or loss for u.s. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off. the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us, which, if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, could invalidate the opinion of counsel. in addition, this opinion is not binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. if the spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. in addition, if the spin-off were deemed taxable, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 26 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management

use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. as of december 31, 2016 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31, 2016 rates and the assumed rates. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("uta") within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. as of december 31, 2016 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $650 . these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2016 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2016 , the debt portfolio was composed of essentially all fixed-rate debt. in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations, we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixed-rate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. at december 31, 2016 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $227 , which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value. 26 kimberly-clark corporation - 2016 annual report commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 27 kimberly-clark corporation - 2016 annual reportrisk factors 3 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, a growing e-commerce marketplace, customers' and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results. we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions, consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to e-tailers, or other changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition. increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. with the consolidation of retail trade, both traditional retailers and e-tailers, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2017 annual report customers, and some of these customers, including large-format retailers and large e-tailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. on january 23, 2018, we announced a new global restructuring program. the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees, suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation or other necessary supplies or services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, eastern europe and latin america. about half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries, and sell products in more than 175 countries. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks: exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2017 annual report increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries. adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences, including consequences from brexit, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events. disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our suppliers, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions. if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, regulatory or other governmental investigation, or product liability or other litigation may also adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, the outcome of these proceedings may not be as expected. 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2017 annual report in addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business, including the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union, which could adversely impact our financial results. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials. damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect in our financial results. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies, including tax reform in the u.s. that was enacted in december 2017. overall, the impact of u.s. tax reform should reduce our effective tax rate; however, additional guidance or interpretations of the tax act could negatively impact our financial results. other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. the 2014 spin-off of our health care business could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders. on october 31, 2014, we completed the spin-off of our health care business, creating a stand-alone, publicly traded health care company, halyard health, inc. ("halyard"). historically, the irs provided companies seeking to perform a spin-off transaction with an advance ruling that the proposed spin-off transaction would qualify for tax-free treatment. however, the irs no longer provides such advance rulings. prior to completing the spin-off of our health care business, we obtained an opinion of counsel that neither we nor our u.s. stockholders will recognize taxable income, gain or loss for u.s. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off. the opinion of counsel is based on certain statements and representations made by us, which, if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect, could invalidate the opinion of counsel. in addition, this opinion is not binding on the irs. accordingly, the irs or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion of counsel. if the spin-off and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. in addition, if the spin-off were deemed taxable, each u.s. holder of our common stock who received shares of halyard would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 24 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions. our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. as of december 31, 2017 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31, 2017 rates and the assumed rates. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("uta") within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. as of december 31, 2017 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $750 . in the view of management, the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2017 , the long-term debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixed-rate debt. 24 kimberly-clark corporation - 2017 annual report in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations, we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixed-rate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. at december 31, 2017 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $285 , which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 25 kimberly-clark corporation - 2017 annual reportrisk factors 2 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. 2 kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation or other necessary supplies or services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. in some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility, but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. there can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices, such as our recently announced plans to increase net selling prices across a majority of our north america consumer products businesses, will be successful. increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. with the consolidation of retail trade, both traditional retailers and e-tailers, we are increasingly dependent on key customers, and some of these customers, including large-format retailers and large e-tailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, a growing e-commerce marketplace, customers' and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. e-commerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results. 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions, consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to e-tailers, or other changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. in january 2018, we announced a global restructuring program. the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees, suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, eastern europe, asean and latin america. about half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 35 countries, and sell products in more than 175 countries. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks: exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries. adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences, including consequences from brexit, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&amp;a") and item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina. 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions. if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. in addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business, including the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union, which could adversely impact our financial results. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data, such as the general data protection regulation ("gdpr") which was recently adopted by the european union. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event, or any failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr or other laws in this area, could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability, or regulatory or other penalties. in addition, we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events. disruption in our supply chain or the failure of third-party providers to satisfactorily perform could adversely impact our operations . our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our suppliers, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies, including tax reform in the u.s. that was enacted in december 2017. other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we may periodically divest product lines or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products. we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 24 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. foreign currency derivative instruments are primarily entered into with major financial institutions. our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. as of december 31, 2018 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31, 2018 rates and the assumed rates. our operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the u.s. dollar. changes in the value of an argentine peso versus the u.s. dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in other (income) and expense, net at the time of the change. as of december 31, 2018, k-c argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ("uta") within stockholders' equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. as of december 31, 2018 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $550 . in 24 kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual report the view of management, the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed-rate debt composed of short and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2018 , the long-term debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixed-rate debt. f rom time to time, we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations, we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixed-rate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. at december 31, 2018 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $255 , which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. in some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility, but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 25 kimberly-clark corporation - 2018 annual reportrisk factors 2 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which continues to experience increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and e-tailers. with the consolidation of retail trade, both traditional retailers and e-tailers, we are increasingly dependent on key customers, and some of these customers, including large-format retailers and large e-tailers, may have significant bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of 2 kimberly-clark corporation - 2019 annual report our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. intense competition for sales of our products, changes in consumer purchasing patterns and the inability to innovate or market our products effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, a growing e-commerce marketplace, and customers' and competitors' actions. our competitors for these markets include global, regional and local manufacturers, including private label manufacturers. some of these competitors may have better access to financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, particularly with respect to private label products, allowing them to offer products at a lower price. e-commerce potentially intensifies competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, which could adversely affect our financial results. we may be unable to anticipate or adequately respond to changes in consumer demand for our products. demand for our products may change based on many factors, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower cost options such as private-label products and mid to lower-tier value products, low birth rates in certain countries due to slow economic growth or other factors, negative consumer response to pricing actions, consumer shifts in distribution from traditional retailers to e-tailers, changing consumer preferences due to increased concerns in regard to post-consumer waste and packaging materials and their impact on environmental sustainability, or other changes in consumer trends or habits. if we experience lower sales due to changes in consumer demand for our products, our earnings could decrease. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. we may not be successful in developing new or improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry, and we may not be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. also, if we fail to perfect or successfully assert our intellectual property rights, we may be less competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and financial condition. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, currency restrictions and political, social and economic instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. our strategy includes operations growth outside the u.s., especially in developing markets such as china, eastern europe, asean and latin america. about half of our net sales come from markets outside the u.s. we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 34 countries, and sell products in more than 175 countries. our results may be substantially affected by a number of foreign market risks: exposure to the movement of various currencies against each other and the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts where available and economically advantageous. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. increases in currency exchange restrictions. these restrictions could limit our ability to repatriate earnings from outside the u.s. or obtain currency exchange for u.s. dollar inputs to continue operating in certain countries. adverse political conditions. risks related to political instability, expropriation, new or revised legal or regulatory constraints, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences, including the united kingdom's withdrawal from the european union (brexit), could adversely affect our financial results. 3 kimberly-clark corporation - 2019 annual report increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. due to weaker foreign exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. the inability to effectively manage foreign market risk could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. see item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ("md&amp;a") and item 8, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our adoption of highly inflationary accounting in argentina. damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) and other sustainability or similar matters, or breaches of consumer, customer, supplier, employee or other confidential information, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiment towards us and our products and brands, and our business and financial results could suffer. in addition, our products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues. consumers increasing use and reliance on social media for information could increase the risk of adverse publicity, potentially with negative perception of our products or brands. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination, or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. if our information technology systems suffer interruptions, failures or breaches, or we fail to comply with data privacy or similar regulations, our business operations could be disrupted and we could face financial and reputational damage. our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, serve an important role in the efficient and effective operation and administration of our business. these systems could be damaged or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, computer viruses or cyber-based attacks. while we have contingency plans in place to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events, if they were to occur and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively address the issues on a timely basis, we could suffer interruptions in our ability to manage our operations, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. increased cyber-security threats and computer crime also pose a potential risk to the security of our information technology systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data stored on those systems. further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations regarding the handling of personal data, such as the general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act. any breach in our information technology security systems could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, supplier, employee or investor information maintained in the ordinary course of our business. any such event, or any failure to comply with these data privacy requirements or other laws in this area, could cause damage to our reputation, loss of valuable information or loss of revenue and could result in legal liability, or regulatory or other penalties. in addition, we may incur large expenditures to investigate or remediate, to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information systems, or to protect against similar future events. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation or other necessary supplies or services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, supplier consolidation which could limit our sources of supply for these items, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. in past years, pulp prices have experienced significant volatility. increases in pulp prices or limits in the availability of recycled fiber could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. in some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures to reduce pulp price volatility, but we have not used derivative instruments to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, feminine pads, incontinence care products and disposable wipes, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based 4 kimberly-clark corporation - 2019 annual report on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors, with these prices experiencing significant volatility in recent years. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted, if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials, or if we do not utilize lower priced substitutes for these materials. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure we use all forms of energy efficiently and cost-effectively, we maintain energy efficiency improvement programs at our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. there can be no assurance that our efforts to increase selling prices in response to increased costs will be successful. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations, including implementing restructuring programs in functions or areas of our business where we believe such opportunities exist. in january 2018, we announced a global restructuring program. the 2018 global restructuring program will reduce our structural cost base by streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing supply chain and overhead organization. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments and in our corporate functions. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees, suppliers or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. government regulations and enforcement, and potential litigation, could have an adverse effect on our financial results. as a global company, we are subject to many laws and governmental regulations across all of the countries in which we do business, including laws and regulations involving marketing, antitrust, anti-bribery or anti-corruption, product liability, environmental, intellectual property or other matters, as well as potential litigation or administrative actions. if we are unable to comply with all laws and regulations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures, and ethics and compliance program will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. in addition, new or revised laws or regulations may alter the environment in which we do business, including brexit, which could adversely impact our financial results. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance, or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs, excise taxes or reduced availability of raw materials. disruption in our supply chain or our manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business . our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell products is critical to our operations. these activities are subject to inherent risks such as natural disasters, power outages, fires or explosions, labor strikes, terrorism, epidemics (including the ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from china), pandemics, import restrictions, regional economic, business, environmental or political events, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change or other concerns regarding the sustainability of our business, which could disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. this interruption, if not mitigated in advance or otherwise effectively managed, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to address. in addition, third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at these third-party manufacturers or service providers due to the reasons above or the failure of these manufacturers or service 5 kimberly-clark corporation - 2019 annual report providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our suppliers, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. new or revised tax regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the u.s. and internationally. many of these jurisdictions have made changes to their tax policies, including tax reform in the u.s. that was enacted in december 2017. other jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity. increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. we may divest or acquire product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we may periodically divest product lines or businesses. these divestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses. furthermore, the divestitures could adversely affect our ongoing business operations, including by enhancing our competitors' positions or reducing consumer confidence in our ongoing brands and products. we may pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses from third parties. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future, or be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. the inability to effectively and efficiently manage divestitures and acquisitions with the results we expect or in the timeframe we anticipate could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 22 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. foreign currency derivative

rates and prices. these analyses reflect management's view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk a portion of our foreign currency risk is managed through the systematic use of foreign currency forward contracts. the use of these instruments supports the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, gains or losses on the underlying foreign currency exposure. we also utilize cross currency swaps and foreign denominated debt to hedge certain investments in foreign subsidiaries. the gain or loss on these instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income to offset the change in value of the net investments being hedged. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate's net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. 22 kimberly-clark corporation - 2019 annual report as of december 31, 2019 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would not be material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. this hypothetical loss on transactional exposures is based on the difference between the december 31, 2019 rates and the assumed rates. our operations in argentina are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the u.s. dollar. changes in the value of an argentine peso versus the u.s. dollar applied to our net peso monetary position are recorded in other (income) and expense, net at the time of the change. as of december 31, 2019, k-c argentina had a small net peso monetary position and a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would not be material. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to

percent change in the currency exchange rates. as of december 31, 2019 , a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders' equity by approximately $550 . in the view of management, the above potential uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable and fixed-rate debt composed of short and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2019 , the long-term debt portfolio was comprised of primarily fixed-rate debt. f rom time to time, we also hedge the anticipated issuance of fixed-rate debt and those contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. in order to determine the impact of changes in interest rates on our financial position or future results of operations, we calculated the increase or decrease in the market value of fixed-rate debt using a 10 percent change in current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. at december 31, 2019 , a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $210 , which would not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we do not record debt at fair value. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. in some instances, we utilize negotiated short-term contract structures, including fixed price contracts, to manage volatility for a portion of our commodity costs, but derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, "risk factors," there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities and manufacturing inputs, used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge a limited portion of the price risk. 23 kimberly-clark corporation - 2019 annual reportquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading. all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. the corporation credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to the fair value of the agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties. in accordance with sfas 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities , as amended, the corporation records all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. changes in the fair value of derivatives are either recorded in income or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. the gain or loss on derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur. the gain or loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is included in other comprehensive income in the period that changes in fair value occur and is reclassified to income in the same period that the hedged item affects income. the gain or loss on derivatives that have not been designated as hedging instruments is included in current income in the period that changes in fair value occur. presented below is a description of our most significant risks (foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during 2003, and management does not foresee or expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year-end. the effect is 41 table of contents part ii (continued) calculated by multiplying each affiliate net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2003, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $49 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2003 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the translation of the balance sheets of our non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2003, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $285 million. these hypothetical increases in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2003 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2003, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 35 percent variable-rate debt, adjusted for the effect of variable-rate assets, and 65 percent fixed-rate debt. the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations did not change significantly during 2003 and management does not foresee or expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed in the near future. we perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2003, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $120 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to commercial paper and other variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would have had no material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined 42 table of contents part ii (continued) by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. management still intends to reduce its level of pulp integration, when market conditions permit, and such a reduction in pulp integration, if accomplished, could increase the corporation commodity price risk. specifically, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. management does not believe that commodity price risk is material to the corporation business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management. 43 table of contents part ii (continued)quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading. all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. the corporation credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to these agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties. 38 table of contents part ii (continued) presented below is a description of our most significant risks (foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect our view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. prior to 2004, foreign currency risk was managed by the selective, rather than the systematic, use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. we perform an annual test to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $43 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2004 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the translation of the balance sheets of our non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, we perform an annual test to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2004, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $638 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2004 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management 39 table of contents part ii (continued) deems appropriate. at december 31, 2004, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 35 percent variable-rate debt and 65 percent fixed-rate debt. the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a target mix of fixed and floating rate debt. the corporation target for variable rate debt is 40 percent to 50 percent and is designed to balance the corporation cost of financing with its interest rate risk. we perform two separate tests to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on our consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on our fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2004, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $110 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to commercial paper and other variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis prior to the spin-off, the corporation supplied approximately 40 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. the spin-off has reduced the internal pulp supply to approximately 10 percent. as previously discussed under factors that may affect future results, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. in addition, the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of this risk when it is deemed prudent to do so by management. management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 40 table of contents part ii (continued)risk factors 4 risk factors the following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10-k, or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission, could adversely affect the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results. increased pricing pressure and intense competition for sales of the corporation products could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. the corporation competes for customers in intensely competitive markets against well-known, branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in the corporation competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of recent consolidations of retailers and distribution channels, and competitive reaction. some of the corporation major competitors have undergone consolidation, which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry. such consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices, which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling its products. there is no guarantee that the corporation efforts to reduce costs will be successful. the corporation began its competitive improvement initiatives in the third quarter of 2005 to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the corporation anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments. if the corporation cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions included in its competitive improvement initiatives or other cost savings plans, the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these initiatives have on the corporation relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation financial results. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation financial results. increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable 4 table of contents part i (continued) supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by such events as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered pulp, is used extensively in the corporation tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of the pulp markets. recycled fiber accounts for approximately 25 percent of the corporation overall fiber requirements. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. a number of the corporation products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, and incontinence care products contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors. the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials. the corporation manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that it uses all forms of energy cost effectively, the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites. the corporation contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. the corporation energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation risk management policy. the corporation sales may not occur as estimated. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences, estimate sales of new products, estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses. as a result, the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales. difficulties in expanding globally and in developing and emerging markets (asia, latin america, the middle east, eastern europe and africa) may adversely affect the corporation financial results. because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries, the corporation results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries. the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations, including fluctuations in currency rates, adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, 5 table of contents part i (continued) difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic, political and competitive environments in argentina, brazil, colombia, mexico, venezuela and elsewhere in latin america and developing countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation sales growth and earnings potential. the corporation success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances, and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form such alliances. in addition, there can be no assurance that the corporation products will be accepted in any particular market. the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. pending litigation and administrative actions could have an adverse effect on the corporation. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. in addition, the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in such actions. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty. although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected. see item 3, legal proceedings. changes in laws, regulations and accounting standards could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. the corporation is subject to federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation, including the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 ( sox ) and numerous related regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission, the public company accounting oversight board and the financial accounting standards board. the corporation has incurred substantial costs in complying with sox and other regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. although the corporation is in compliance with the laws and regulations regarding recording and reporting of financial results, there can be no assurance that future regulations or interpretations of such regulations will not have an adverse impact on the corporation financial results as compared with prior reporting periods. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading. all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. the corporation credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties. presented below is a description of the corporation most significant risks (foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency

instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. prior to 2004, foreign currency risk was managed by the selective, rather than the systematic, use of foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2005, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $63 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2005 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2005, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced 36 table of contents part ii (continued) stockholders equity by approximately $528 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2005 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2005, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 51 percent variable-rate debt and 49 percent fixed-rate debt. the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and is designed to balance the corporation cost of financing with its interest rate risk. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2005, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $91 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to commercial paper and other variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. in addition, the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of this risk in accordance with the corporation risk management policy. management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 37 table of contents part ii (continued)risk factors 4 risk factors the following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10-k, or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission, could adversely affect the corporation's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation financial results. increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by such events as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in the corporation tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets. recycled fiber accounts for approximately 29 percent of the corporation and its equity companies' overall fiber requirements. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. a number of the corporation products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, and incontinence care products contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors. the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely

capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials. the corporation's manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that it uses all forms of energy cost-effectively, the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites. the corporation contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. the corporation energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully 4 table of contents part i (continued) protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation's risk management policy. increased pricing pressure and intense competition for sales of the corporation products could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. the corporation competes in intensely competitive markets against well-known, branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in the corporation competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitive reaction. some of the corporation major competitors have undergone consolidation, which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry. such consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices, which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of the corporation competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the corporation. these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the corporation can. the corporation ability to develop new products is affected by whether it can develop and fund technological innovations, receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling its products. changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business. the corporation products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s. and europe, the corporation is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining power than does the corporation. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. the corporation may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and other conditions. if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, the corporation business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. there is no guarantee that the corporation efforts to reduce costs will be successful. the corporation began its competitive improvement initiatives in the third quarter of 2005 to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial 5 table of contents part i (continued) condition and results of operations. in addition, the corporation anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments. if the corporation cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions included in its competitive improvement initiatives or other cost savings plans, the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these initiatives have on the corporation relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation financial results. the corporation sales may not occur as estimated. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences, estimate sales of new products, estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses. as a result, the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales. difficulties in expanding globally and in developing and emerging markets (asia, latin america, the middle east, eastern europe and africa) may adversely affect the corporation financial results. because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 40 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries, the corporation results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries. the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic, political and competitive environments in latin america and developing countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation sales growth and earnings potential. the corporation success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances, and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form such alliances. in addition, there can be no assurance that the corporation products will be accepted in any particular market. the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward, option and swap contracts. translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. pending litigation and administrative actions could have an adverse effect on the corporation. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. in addition, the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in such actions. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty. although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected. see item 3, legal proceedings. 6 table of contents part i (continued) beginning in 2007, t he corporation will obtain certain administrative services from third part ies which have previously been provided by employees of the corporation. if the third-party service providers fail to satisfactorily perform these administrative services, our operations could be adversely impact ed . as part of the corporation global business plan, a number of administrative functions are being transferred to third-party service providers beginning in 2007. those functions include certain: information technology; finance and accounting; sourcing and supply management; and human resources services. although moving these administrative functions to third-party service providers is expected to lower the corporation cost of operations, the corporation could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services. disruptions or delays at the third-party service providers due to regional economic, business, environmental, or political events, or information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact the corporation operations, payments to the corporation vendors, employees, and others, and the corporation ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation

tests are presented in the following paragraphs. as of december 31, 2006, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $30 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2006 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. 35 table of contents part ii (continued) as of december 31, 2006, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation's foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $541 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2006 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable-and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2006, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 43 percent variable-rate debt and 57 percent fixed-rate debt. the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and is designed to balance the corporation cost of financing with its interest rate risk. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation's financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2006, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $84 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation's current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to commercial paper and other variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have had a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 10 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. the corporation's energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas risk in accordance with the corporation's risk management policy. management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 36 table of contents part ii (continued)risk factors 4 risk factors the following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10-k, or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission, could adversely affect the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation financial results. increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by such events as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in the corporation tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets. recycled fiber accounts for approximately 31 percent of the corporation and its equity companies overall fiber requirements. increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. a number of the corporation products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, incontinence care products, disposable wipes and various health care products, contain certain materials which are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors. the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials. 4 table of contents part i (continued) the corporation manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that it uses all forms of energy cost-effectively, the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites. the corporation contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. the corporation energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation risk management policy. increased pricing pressure and intense competition for sales of the corporation products could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. the corporation competes in intensely competitive markets against well-known, branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in the corporation competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitive reaction. some of the corporation major competitors have undergone consolidation, which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry. such consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices, which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of the corporation competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the corporation. these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the corporation can. the corporation ability to develop new products is affected by whether it can develop and fund technological innovations, receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising, marketing and selling its products. changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business. the corporation products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s. and europe, the corporation is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining power than does the corporation. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. the corporation may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on 5 table of contents part i (continued) access to shelf space, delisting of our products; additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues; and other conditions. if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, the corporation business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. there is no guarantee that the corporation efforts to reduce costs will be successful. the corporation began its competitive improvement initiatives in the third quarter of 2005 to improve its competitive position by accelerating investments in targeted growth opportunities and streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. in addition, the corporation anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments. if the corporation cannot successfully implement the strategic cost reductions included in its competitive improvement initiatives or other cost savings plans, the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these initiatives have on the corporation relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation financial results. the corporation sales may not occur as estimated. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences, estimate sales of new products, estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses. as a result, the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales. the corporation international operations are subject to foreign market risks which may adversely affect the corporation financial results. because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries, the corporation results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries. the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets and the challenging economic, political and competitive environments in latin america and developing countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation sales growth and earnings potential. the corporation success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances, and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form such alliances. in addition, there can be no assurance that the corporation products will be accepted in any particular market. the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, are systematically hedged through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. 6 table of contents part i (continued) translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. the corporation may acquire new product lines or businesses and may have difficulties integrating future acquisitions or may not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions. the corporation may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, personnel turnover and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from future acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. any inability by us to integrate and manage any acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. moreover, future acquisitions by us could result in our incurring substantial additional indebtedness, being exposed to contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. pending litigation and administrative actions could have an adverse effect on the corporation. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. in addition, the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in such actions. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation cannot be determined with certainty. although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected. see item 3, legal proceedings. the corporation obtains certain administrative services from third parties which previously were provided by employees of the corporation. if the third-party service providers fail to satisfactorily perform their administrative services, our operations could be adversely impacted. as part of the corporation global business plan, a number of administrative functions have been transferred to third-party service providers. those functions include certain: information technology; finance and accounting; sourcing and supply management; and human resources services. although moving these administrative functions to third-party service providers is expected to improve certain capabilities and lower the corporation cost of operations, the corporation could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services. disruptions or delays at the third-party service providers due to regional economic, business, environmental, or political events, or information technology system failures or military actions could adversely impact the corporation operations, payments to the corporation vendors, employees, and others, and the corporation ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. 7 table of contents part i (continued) quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 38 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading. all foreign currency derivative instruments are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions. the corporation credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties. presented below is a description of the corporation most significant risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of the corporation commodity price risk. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts. the use of these instruments allows management of transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. management does not foresee or expect any significant change in its foreign currency risk exposures or in the strategies it employs to manage them in the near future. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs. as of december 31, 2007, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $34 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2007 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical increase in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2007, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced 38 table of contents part ii (continued) stockholders equity by approximately $563 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2007 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2007, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 40 percent variable-rate debt and 60 percent fixed-rate debt. the strategy employed to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations consists primarily of a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and is designed to balance the corporation cost of financing with its interest rate risk. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2007, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $190 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to commercial paper and other variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. the corporation energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas risk in accordance with the corporation risk management policy. management does not believe that these risks are material to the corporation business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 39 table of contents part ii (continued)risk factors 4 risk factors the following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10-k, or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission, could adversely affect the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results. global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect the corporation business and financial results. unfavorable economic conditions, including the impact of recessions in the united states and throughout the world, may continue to negatively affect the corporation business and financial results. these economic conditions could negatively impact (i) consumer demand for our products, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower-cost options such as private label products, (ii) the mix of our products sales, (iii) our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers and (iv) the ability of certain suppliers to fill our orders for raw materials or other goods and services. a prolonged recession could result in decreased revenue, margins and earnings. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation financial results. increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in the corporation tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets. recycled fiber accounts for approximately 32 percent of the corporation and its equity companies overall fiber requirements. increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation

business. the corporation products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the 5 table of contents part i (continued) consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s. and europe, the corporation is increasingly dependent on

limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products; additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues; and other conditions. if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, the corporation business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. there is no guarantee that the corporation efforts to reduce costs will be successful. the corporation continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by accelerating cost reductions in its operations. in addition, the corporation expects to obtain ongoing cost savings from its recently completed streamlining of manufacturing and administrative operations. the corporation further anticipates cost savings to result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. if the corporation cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans, the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these plans have on the corporation relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation financial results. the corporation sales may not occur as estimated. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences, estimate sales of new products, estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation products in new markets and anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses. as a result, the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales. the corporation international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk and currency restrictions, which may adversely affect the corporation financial results. because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries, the corporation results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries. the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency restrictions, adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, costs and difficulties in managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets, and the challenging economic, political and competitive environments in latin america and developing and other countries in eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation sales growth and earnings potential. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. the corporation success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or to form successful business alliances, and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form these alliances. in addition, there can be no assurance that the corporation products will be accepted in any particular market. 6 table of contents part i (continued) the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically hedged through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged. weaker foreign currency exchange rates reduce the potential benefit of forecasted declines in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. the current credit market disruptions and recession in the united states and certain foreign countries may adversely affect our business. during 2008, unprecedented volatility in global commodity, currency and financial markets resulted in a high level of uncertainty in the business environment, which is expected to continue into 2009. the corporation relies on access to the credit markets, specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets, to provide supplemental funding for its operations. although the corporation has not experienced a disruption in its ability to access the credit markets, there is no assurance that the credit markets will not deteriorate further. it is possible that the corporation may have difficulty accessing the credit markets in the future, which may disrupt its businesses or further increase the corporation cost of funding its operations. additionally, the current uncertainty in global economic conditions resulting from the recent disruptions in credit markets and other factors, including recession in the united states and recessions in various foreign markets where the corporation operates, may adversely affect our sales and results of operations. if the current situation deteriorates significantly, our business could be further negatively impacted, including reduced demand for our products, or supplier, customer or creditor disruptions, resulting from tighter credit markets and other economic factors. the corporation may acquire new product lines or businesses and may have difficulties integrating future acquisitions or may not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions. the corporation may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, personnel turnover and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we may acquire in the future. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from future acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. any inability by us to integrate and manage any acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, any inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or any unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. moreover, future acquisitions by us could result in our incurring substantial additional indebtedness, being exposed to contingent liabilities or incurring the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. pending litigation, administrative actions and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on the corporation. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. in addition, the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the 7 table of contents part i (continued) corporation and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. although management believes that no such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the corporation, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such proceedings will be as expected. see item 3, legal proceedings . the corporation obtains certain manufactured products and administrative services from third parties. if the third-party providers fail to satisfactorily perform, our operations could be adversely impacted. as part of the corporation global business plan, a number of administrative functions have been transferred to third-party service providers. those functions include certain information technology; finance and accounting; sourcing and supply management; and human resources services. although moving these administrative functions to third-party service providers is expected to improve certain capabilities and lower the corporation cost of operations, the corporation could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services. additionally, third parties manufacture some of the corporation products. disruptions or delays at the third-party manufacturers or service providers due to regional economic, business, environmental, or political events, or information technology system failures or military actions, or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact the corporation operations, sales, payments to the corporation vendors, employees, and others, and the corporation ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. the corporation credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of the corporation risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of the corporation commodity price risk. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of the corporation exposure. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs. 36 table of contents part ii (continued) as of december 31, 2008, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $43 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2008 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2008, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $462 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2008 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position because they would not affect the corporation cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2008, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 20 percent variable-rate debt and 80 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2008, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $200 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to commercial paper and other variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. 37 table of contents part ii (continued) the corporation energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a substantial portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation risk management policy. 38 table of contents part ii (continued)risk factors 4 risk factors the following factors, as well as factors described elsewhere in this form 10-k, or in other filings by the corporation with the securities and exchange commission, could adversely affect the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results. increased pricing pressure, intense competition for sales of the corporation products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. the corporation competes in intensely competitive markets against well-known, branded products and private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in the corporation competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitive reaction. some of the corporation major competitors have undergone consolidation, which could result in increased competition and alter the dynamics of the industry. this consolidation may give competitors greater financial resources and greater market penetration and enable competitors to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices, which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. it may be necessary for the corporation to lower prices on its products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect the corporation financial results. in addition, the corporation incurs substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of the corporation competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the corporation. these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than the corporation. the corporation ability to develop new products is affected by whether it can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that the corporation will be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling its products. 4 table of contents part i (continued) changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business. the corporation products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, the corporation is increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining power than does the corporation. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. the corporation may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of its retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products; additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues; and other conditions. if the corporation loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, the corporation business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services could adversely affect the corporation financial results. increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change concerns, and the like could have an adverse effect on the corporation financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in the corporation tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets. recycled fiber accounts for approximately 32 percent of the corporation and its equity companies overall fiber requirements. increases in pulp prices could adversely affect the corporation earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. a number of the corporation products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, incontinence care products, disposable wipes and various health care products, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors. the corporation purchases these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect the corporation earnings if selling prices for its finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. although the corporation believes that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture its products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints and other factors (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses) could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials. the corporation manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that it uses all forms of energy cost-effectively, the corporation maintains ongoing energy efficiency 5 table of contents part i (continued) improvement programs at all of its manufacturing sites. the corporation contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. the corporation energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation risk management policy. global economic conditions, including recessions or slow economic growth, and continuing credit market disruptions in the united states and certain foreign countries, could continue to adversely affect the corporation business and financial results. unfavorable economic conditions, including the impact of recessions, slow economic growth and credit market disruptions in the united states and certain foreign countries, may continue to negatively affect the corporation business and financial results. these economic conditions could negatively impact: consumer demand for our products, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower-cost options such as private-label products, demand by businesses for our products, including effects of increased unemployment and cost savings efforts of those customers, the mix of our products sales, our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers, and the ability of certain suppliers to fill our orders for raw materials or other goods and services. ongoing volatility in global commodity, currency and financial markets resulted in uncertainty in the business environment in 2009, which is expected to continue into 2010. the corporation relies on access to the credit markets, specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets, to provide supplemental funding for its operations. although the corporation has not experienced a disruption in its ability to access the credit markets, it is possible that the corporation may have difficulty accessing the credit markets in the future, which may disrupt its businesses or further increase the corporation cost of funding its operations. prolonged recessions, slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue, margins and earnings. the corporation international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk and currency restrictions, which may adversely affect the corporation financial results. because the corporation and its equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 38 countries and their products are sold in more than 150 countries, the corporation results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. the corporation is subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries. the corporation faces increased risks in its international operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, currency restrictions, adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, risks of expropriation, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect the corporation financial results. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and 6 table of contents part i (continued) results of operations and item 8, note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, for information about the effects of currency restrictions, currency devaluation and inflation in venezuela on the corporation financial results in 2009 and 2010. in addition, intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets, and the challenging economic, political and competitive environments in latin america, eastern europe and asia may slow the corporation sales growth and earnings potential. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. the corporation success internationally also depends on its ability to acquire or form successful business alliances, and there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to acquire or form these alliances. in addition, there can be no assurance that the corporation products will be accepted in any particular market. the corporation is subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. translation exposure for the corporation with respect to foreign operations generally is not hedged. weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. there can be no assurance that the corporation will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. there is no guarantee that the corporation ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. the corporation continues to implement plans to improve its competitive position by achieving cost reductions in its operations. in addition, the corporation expects ongoing cost savings from its organization optimization initiative and ongoing continuous improvement activities. the corporation anticipates these continuing cost savings will result from previous reductions of its worldwide salaried workforce, reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in each of its business segments. see item 7, management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. if the corporation cannot successfully implement its cost savings plans, the corporation may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these plans have on the corporation relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect the corporation financial results. the corporation sales may not occur as estimated. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be able to anticipate consumer preferences, estimate sales of new products, estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of the corporation products in new markets or anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses. as a result, the corporation may not be able to achieve anticipated sales. the corporation may acquire new product lines or businesses and may have difficulties integrating future acquisitions or may not realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions. the corporation may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, personnel turnover and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. 7 table of contents part i (continued) the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. moreover, future acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness, exposure to contingent liabilities or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. if we are unable to hire, develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce, it could have an adverse effect on our business. our strategy includes a focus on hiring, developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce. we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills. unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions, or to hire and retain a diverse, skilled workforce, could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit, develop and retain the key personnel that we need. pending litigation, administrative actions and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect on the corporation. there is no guarantee that the corporation will be successful in defending itself in legal and administrative actions or in asserting its rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. in addition, the corporation could incur substantial costs in defending itself or in asserting its rights in these actions. the corporation sales and results of operations also may be adversely affected by new legal requirements, including proposed health care reform legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against the corporation and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to the corporation, directly for its compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. although management believes that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on the corporation, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements will be as expected. see item 3, legal proceedings . the corporation obtains certain manufactured products and administrative services from third parties. if the third-party providers fail to satisfactorily perform, our operations could be adversely impacted. third parties manufacture some of the corporation products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at the third-party manufacturers or service providers due to regional economic, business, environmental, or political events, or information technology system failures or military actions, or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact the corporation operations, sales, payments to the corporation vendors, employees, and others, and the corporation ability to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis. administrative functions transferred to third-party service providers include certain information technology; 8 table of contents part i (continued) finance and accounting; sourcing and supply management; and human resources services. although moving these administrative functions to third-party service providers has improved certain capabilities and lowered the corporation cost of operations, the corporation could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 34 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, the corporation is exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. the corporation credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of the corporation risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of the corporation commodity price risk. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of the corporation exposure. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on the foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures of the corporation and its foreign affiliates at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs. as of december 31, 2009, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $29 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2009 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. this analysis does not include the impacts of the changes in january 2010 of the venezuelan bolivar described previously in item 7. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. as of december 31, 2009, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of the corporation foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced 34 table of contents part ii (continued) stockholders equity by approximately $622 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2009 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to the corporation consolidated financial position because they would not affect the corporation cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2009, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 23 percent variable-rate debt and 77 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on the corporation financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2009, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $190 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to the corporation current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk the corporation is subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis, the corporation supplies approximately 8 percent of its virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. the corporation energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, there can be no assurance that the corporation will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, the corporation is subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in its manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with the corporation risk management policy. 35 table of contents part ii (continued)risk factors 4 risk factors our business faces many risks and uncertainties that we cannot control. any of the risks discussed below, as well as factors described in other places in this form 10-k, or in our other filings with the sec, could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. in addition, these items could cause our future results to differ from those in any of our forward-looking statements. these risks are not the only ones we face. other risks that we do not presently know about or that we presently believe are not material could also adversely affect us. significant increases in prices for raw materials, energy, transportation and other necessary supplies and services, without corresponding increases in our selling prices, could adversely affect our financial results. increases in the cost of and availability of raw materials, including pulp and petroleum-based materials, the cost of energy, transportation and other necessary services, supplier constraints, an inability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or an inability to avoid disruptions in production output caused by events such as natural disasters, power outages, labor strikes, governmental regulatory requirements or nongovernmental voluntary actions in response to global climate change concerns, and the like could have an adverse effect on our financial results. cellulose fiber, in the form of kraft pulp or recycled fiber from recovered waste paper, is used extensively in our tissue products and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to the cyclical nature of these fiber markets. cellulose fiber, in the form of fluff pulp, is a key component in our personal care products. increases in pulp prices could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if these adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. a number of our products, such as diapers, training and youth pants, incontinence care products, disposable wipes and various health care products, contain certain materials that are principally derived from petroleum. these materials are subject to price fluctuations based on changes in petroleum prices, availability and other factors. we purchase these materials from a number of suppliers. significant increases in prices for these materials could adversely affect our earnings if selling prices for our finished products are not adjusted or if adjustments significantly trail the increases in prices for these materials. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. although we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints, natural disasters and other factors (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses) could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials. our manufacturing operations utilize electricity, natural gas and petroleum-based fuels. to ensure that we use all forms of energy cost-effectively, we maintain ongoing energy efficiency improvement programs at all of our manufacturing sites. our contracts with energy suppliers vary as to price, payment terms, quantities and duration. our energy costs are also affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of 4 table of contents part i (continued) particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions (including actions taken to address climate change and related market responses). there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. derivative instruments are used to manage a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. increased pricing pressure, intense competition for sales of our products and the inability to innovate effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial results. we compete in intensely competitive markets against well-known, branded products and low-cost or private label products both domestically and internationally. inherent risks in our competitive strategy include uncertainties concerning trade and consumer acceptance, the effects of consolidation within retailer and distribution channels, and competitive reaction. our competitors for these markets include not only our traditional competitors but also private label manufacturers, low-cost manufacturers and rapidly-expanding international manufacturers. these competitors may have greater financial resources and greater market penetration, which enable them to offer a wider variety of products and services at more competitive prices. alternatively, some of these competitors may have significantly lower product development and manufacturing costs, allowing them to offer products at a lower cost. the actions of these competitors could adversely affect our financial results. it may be necessary for us to lower prices on our products and increase spending on advertising and promotions, each of which could adversely affect our financial results. our ability to develop new products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate consumer needs and preferences, develop and fund technological innovations, and receive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection. in addition, we incur substantial development and marketing costs in introducing new and improved products and technologies. the introduction of a new consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually requires substantial expenditures for advertising and marketing to gain recognition in the marketplace. if a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising and promotional support to maintain its relative market position. some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources. these competitors may be able to spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities, introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. there is no guarantee that we will be successful in developing new and improved products and technologies necessary to compete successfully in the industry or that we will be successful in advertising, marketing, timely launching and selling our products. global economic conditions, including recessions or slow economic growth, and continuing global credit market volatility, could continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. unfavorable global economic conditions, including the impact of recessions, slow economic growth, economic and pricing instability and credit market volatility, may continue to negatively affect our business and financial results. these economic conditions could negatively impact: consumer demand for our products, including shifting consumer purchasing patterns to lower-cost options such as private-label products, demand by businesses for our products, including effects of increased unemployment and cost savings efforts of those customers, the mix of our products sales, and our ability to collect accounts receivable on a timely basis from certain customers. 5 table of contents part i (continued) ongoing volatility in global commodity, currency and financial markets has continued to result in uncertainty in the business environment. we rely on access to the credit markets, specifically the commercial paper and public bond markets, to provide supplemental funding for our operations. although we have not experienced a disruption in our ability to access the credit markets, it is possible that we may have difficulty accessing the credit markets in the future, which may disrupt our businesses or further increase our cost of funding our operations. prolonged recessions, slow economic growth or credit market disruptions could result in decreased revenue, margins and earnings. changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets may adversely affect our business. our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace, which is experiencing increased concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. with the consolidation of retail trade, especially in developed markets such as the u.s., europe and australia, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining power. they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts or allowances which could lead to reduced profitability. we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, additional requirements related to safety, environmental, social and other sustainability issues, and other conditions. if we lose a significant customer or if sales of our products to a significant customer materially decrease, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. if we are unable to hire, develop or retain key employees or a skilled and diverse workforce, it could have an adverse effect on our business. our strategy includes a focus on hiring, developing and retaining our management team and a skilled and diverse international workforce. a skilled and diverse international workforce is a significant factor in developing product innovation, as well as providing key viewpoints representative of our international consumer base. we compete to hire new employees and then seek to train them to develop their skills. unplanned turnover or failure to develop an effective succession plan for our leadership positions, or to hire and retain a diverse, skilled workforce, could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations. there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully recruit, develop and retain the key personnel that we need. our international operations are subject to foreign market risks, including foreign exchange risk, currency restrictions and political instability, which may adversely affect our financial results. because we and our equity companies have manufacturing facilities in 39 countries, with products sold in more than 150 countries, our results may be substantially affected by foreign market risks. we are subject to the impact of economic and political instability in developing countries. we are subject to the movement of various currencies against each other and versus the u.s. dollar. a portion of the exposures, arising from transactions and commitments denominated in non-local currencies, is systematically managed through foreign currency forward and swap contracts. we do not generally hedge our translation exposure with respect to foreign operations. weaker foreign currency exchange rates increase the potential impact of forecasted increases in dollar-based input costs for operations outside the u.s. there can be no assurance that we will be protected against substantial foreign currency fluctuations. 6 table of contents part i (continued) in addition, we face increased risks in our international operations, including currency restrictions, adverse political and economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, tariffs and other trade barriers, risks of expropriation, difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights, and potentially adverse tax consequences. each of these factors could adversely affect our financial results. see md&amp;a and item 8, note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, for information about the effects of currency restrictions, currency devaluation and inflation in venezuela on our financial results in 2010. in addition, intense competition in european personal care and tissue markets, and the challenging economic, political and competitive environments in latin america, eastern europe, africa and asia may slow our sales growth and earnings potential. our success internationally also depends on our ability to acquire or form successful business alliances, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire or form these alliances. in addition, there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted in any particular market. there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful. we continue to implement plans to improve our competitive position by achieving cost reductions in our operations. in addition, we expect ongoing cost savings from our continuous improvement activities. we anticipate these continuing cost savings will result from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains, distribution efficiencies and overhead reductions in each of our business segments. see md&amp;a. if we cannot successfully implement our cost savings plans, we may not realize all anticipated benefits. any negative impact these plans have on our relationships with employees or customers or any failure to generate the anticipated efficiencies and savings could adversely affect our financial results. damage to the reputation of kimberly-clark or to one or more of our brands could adversely affect our business. developing and maintaining our reputation, as well as the reputation of our brands, is a critical factor in our relationship with consumers, customers, suppliers and others. our inability to address adverse publicity or other issues, including concerns about product safety, quality, efficacy or similar matters, real or perceived, could negatively impact sentiments towards us and our products, and our business and financial results could suffer. our business and results could also be negatively impacted by the effects of a significant product recall, product-related litigation, allegations of product tampering or contamination or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. our sales may not occur as estimated. there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate consumer preferences, estimate sales of new products, estimate changes in population characteristics and the acceptance of our products in new markets or anticipate changes in technology and competitive responses. as a result, we may not be able to achieve anticipated sales. pending litigation, administrative actions, tax matters, regulatory requirements and new legal requirements could have an adverse effect. there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending against legal and administrative actions or in asserting our rights under various laws, including intellectual property laws. in addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending against or in asserting our rights in these actions. we are subject to income tax requirements in various jurisdictions in the united states and internationally. increases in applicable tax rates, changes in applicable tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 7 table of contents part i (continued) aspects of our business, including health care, are subject to many laws and governmental regulations, including regulations by the food and drug administration and comparable foreign agencies, as well as potential litigation. adverse regulatory action, including a recall, or product liability or other litigation may adversely affect our financial condition and business operations. our sales and results of operations also may be adversely affected by new legal requirements, including health care reform legislation and climate change and other environmental legislation and regulations. the costs and other effects of pending litigation and administrative actions against us and new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. for example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs to us, directly for our compliance or indirectly to the extent suppliers increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials. although we believe that none of these proceedings or requirements will have a material adverse effect on us, there can be no assurance that the outcome of these proceedings or effects of new legal requirements will be as expected. see item 3, legal proceedings . we may acquire or divest product lines or businesses, which could impact our results. we may pursue acquisitions of new product lines or businesses. acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired product lines or businesses, estimation and assumption of liabilities and contingencies, personnel turnover and the diversion of management attention from other business concerns. we may be unable to identify suitable additional acquisition candidates or may be unable to successfully integrate and manage product lines or businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future. in addition, we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate, or at all. the inability to integrate and manage acquired product lines or businesses in a timely and efficient manner, the inability to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated benefits from these acquisitions in the timeframe we anticipate or the unanticipated required increases in trade, promotional or capital spending from these acquisitions could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. moreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional indebtedness, exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation or the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. alternatively, we may periodically divest product lines or businesses, which may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses. we obtain certain manufactured products and administrative services from third parties. if the third-party providers fail to satisfactorily perform, our operations could be adversely impacted. third parties manufacture some of our products and provide certain administrative services. disruptions or delays at the third-party manufacturers or service providers due to regional economic, business, environmental, or political events, or information technology system failures or military actions, or the failure of these manufacturers or service providers to otherwise satisfactorily perform, could adversely impact our operations, sales, payments to our vendors, employees, and others, and our ability to report financial and management 8 table of contents part i (continued) information on a timely and accurate basis. administrative functions transferred to third-party service providers include certain information technology, finance and accounting, sourcing and supply management, and human resources services. although moving these administrative functions to third-party service providers has improved certain capabilities and lowered our cost of operations, we could experience disruptions in the quality and timeliness of the services. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 33 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to risks such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks, including operating and financing activities and, where deemed appropriate, the use of derivative instruments. derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation. all foreign currency derivative instruments are entered into with major financial institutions. our credit exposure under these arrangements is limited to agreements with a positive fair value at the reporting date. credit risk with respect to the counterparties is actively monitored but is not considered significant since these transactions are executed with a diversified group of financial institutions. presented below is a description of our risks (foreign currency risk and interest rate risk) together with a sensitivity analysis, performed annually, of each of these risks based on selected changes in market rates and prices. these analyses reflect management view of changes which are reasonably possible to occur over a one-year period. also included is a description of our commodity price risk. foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is managed by the systematic use of foreign currency forward and swap contracts for a portion of our exposure. the use of these instruments allows the management of transactional exposures to exchange rate fluctuations because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instruments will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. an annual test is performed to quantify the effects that possible changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on annual operating profit based on our foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures at the current year-end. the balance sheet effect is calculated by multiplying each affiliate net monetary asset or liability position by a 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rate versus the u.s. dollar. the results of these sensitivity tests are presented in the following paragraphs. as of december 31, 2010, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of foreign currencies involving balance sheet transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $39 million. these hypothetical losses on transactional exposures are based on the difference between the december 31, 2010 rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above hypothetical losses resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. our operations in venezuela are reported using highly inflationary accounting and their functional currency is the u.s. dollar. changes in the value of a venezuelan bolivar versus the u.s. dollar applied to our bolivar-denominated net monetary asset position are recorded in income at the time of the change. at december 31, 2010, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate would have resulted in a net pretax loss of approximately $10 million. there are no viable options for hedging this exposure. the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations from local currencies into u.s. dollars is also sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. consequently, an annual test is performed to determine if changes in currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of non-u.s. operations into u.s. dollars. these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments ( uta ) within stockholders equity. the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non-u.s. operations by a 10 percent change in the currency exchange rates. the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph. 33 table of contents part ii (continued) as of december 31, 2010, a 10 percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the u.s. dollar against the prevailing market rates of our foreign currency translation exposures would have reduced stockholders equity by approximately $810 million. these hypothetical adjustments in uta are based on the difference between the december 31, 2010 exchange rates and the assumed rates. in the view of management, the above uta adjustments resulting from these assumed changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not material to our consolidated financial position because they would not affect our cash flow. interest rate risk interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a portfolio of variable- and fixed-rate debt composed of short- and long-term instruments. the objective is to maintain a cost-effective mix that management deems appropriate. at december 31, 2010, the debt portfolio was composed of approximately 20 percent variable-rate debt and 80 percent fixed-rate debt. two separate tests are performed to determine whether changes in interest rates would have a significant effect on our financial position or future results of operations. both tests are based on consolidated debt levels at the time of the test. the first test estimates the effect of interest rate changes on fixed-rate debt. interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in the market value of fixed-rate debt due to differences between the current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments. with respect to fixed-rate debt outstanding at december 31, 2010, a 10 percent decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of fixed-rate debt by about $182 million. the second test estimates the potential effect on future pretax income that would result from increased interest rates applied to our current level of variable-rate debt. with respect to variable-rate debt, a 10 percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the future results of operations or cash flows. commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk, the most significant of which relates to the price of pulp. selling prices of tissue products are influenced, in part, by the market price for pulp, which is determined by industry supply and demand. on a worldwide basis, we currently supply less than 10 percent of our virgin fiber needs from internal pulp manufacturing operations. this supply will be outsourced as we exit our pulp manufacturing operations as part of our pulp and tissue restructuring (see item 8, note 19 for additional information). as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, increases in pulp prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments significantly trail the increases in pulp prices. derivative instruments have not been used to manage these risks. our energy, manufacturing and transportation costs are affected by various market factors including the availability of supplies of particular forms of energy, energy prices and local and national regulatory decisions. as previously discussed under item 1a, risk factors, there can be no assurance we will be fully protected against substantial changes in the price or availability of energy sources. in addition, we are subject to price risk for utilities, primarily natural gas, which are used in our manufacturing operations. derivative instruments are used to hedge a portion of natural gas price risk in accordance with our risk management policy. 34 table of contents part ii (continued)
