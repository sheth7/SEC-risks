risk factors 16 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2009 we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of $60.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 2.50%. a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2009, a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately $0.6 million based on our current level of borrowings.risk factors 16 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in shares of our class a common stock. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative or judicial restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, all of our outstanding class b common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers and provide us with a significant percentage of our data. if our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p c primary insurers. if the downturn in the u.s. insurance industry continues or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2010, approximately 57% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p c primary insurers. also, sales of certain of our solutions are tied to premiums in the u.s. p c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control. in addition, our 16 table of contents revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry; changes in technology; our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions; saturation of market demand; loss of key customers; industry consolidation; and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a continued downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our revenue from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the u.s. mortgage market. revenue derived from solutions we provide the u.s. mortgage and mortgage-related industries accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenue in the year ended december 31, 2010. our forensic audit business and business with government-sponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 65% of our total mortgage and mortgage-related revenue in 2010. because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans, reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue. mortgage origination volumes in 2010 declined versus 2009 and may continue to decline based on the changes in the mortgage market related to the u.s. mortgage crisis. recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac. the restructuring or elimination of either fannie mae or freddie mac could have a negative effect on the u. s. mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry. if origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline, our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers. our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the u.s. mortgage crisis. two customers represent the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2010 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace them with new customers, our revenue may decline. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p c insurance services sector. any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly 17 table of contents than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the united states, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver privacy protection act, health insurance portability and accountability act, the 18 table of contents european union data protection directive and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. in addition, customers misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers expectations; or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. we may detect incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 19 table of contents we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. the on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets; 20 table of contents failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner; assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company; managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business; distracting management focus from our core businesses; difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses; impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners; incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets; incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities, lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such facilities. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost twenty years. however, with the exception of frank j. coyne, our chairman and chief executive officer, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and 21 table of contents financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust litigation. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. our liquidity, financial position and profitability could be adversely affected by further deterioration in u.s. and international credit markets and economic conditions. deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail. these conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, resulting in a contraction of available credit, even for the most credit-worthy borrowers. due to recent market events, our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet its funding obligations. in such an event, we may not be able to draw on all, or a substantial portion, of our uncommitted credit facilities, which would adversely affect our liquidity. also, if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to, or replacement of, our existing credit facilities to finance our continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise, the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation. the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. in addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions. specifically, certain of our fraud identification and detection solutions are directed at the mortgage market. this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure 22 table of contents levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations. any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2010, our stockholders, who owned our shares prior to the ipo and follow-on offering, continue to beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 24,577,690 shares of our class a common stock, primarily owned by our esop, 12,225,480 shares of our class b (series 1), or class b-1, common stock and 14,771,340 shares of our class b (series 2), or class b-2, common stock, representing in aggregate approximately 30.33% of our outstanding common stock. such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. certain members of our management are subject to lock-up agreements with us whereby they are not be permitted to sell any of their common stock, subject to certain conditions, for a period of time. restrictions under these lock-up agreements expire in part on april 6, 2011 and expire completely on october 6, 2011. also, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our class b stockholders are not able to sell any of their common stock, subject to certain conditions, to the public for a period of time. each share of class b-1 common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by the holder, into one share of class a common stock on april 6, 2011. each share of class b-2 common stock shall convert automatically, without any action by the holder, into one share of class a common stock on october 6, 2011. our board of directors may approve exceptions to the limitation on transfers of our class b common stock in their sole discretion, in connection with the sale of such class b common stock in a public offering registered with the securities and exchange commission or in such other limited circumstances as our board of directors may determine. any class b common stock sold to the public will first be converted to class a common stock. such further resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 23,018,745 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 25, 2011. we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. the holders of our class b common stock have the right to elect up to three out of eleven of our directors and their interests in our business may be different than yours. until no class b common stock remains outstanding, the holders of our class b common stock will have the right to elect up to three of our directors. stockholders of the class b common stock may not have the same incentive to approve a corporate action that may be favorable for the holders of class a common 23 table of contents stock, or their interests may otherwise conflict with those of class a stockholders. for example, holders of our class b common stock may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or the use of our solutions, but which might involve risks to holders of our class a common stock, including a potential decrease in the price of our class a common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt; prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors; require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; authorize the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, subject to the rules and regulations of the nasdaq global select market; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2010, we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of $310.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.75%. a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2010, a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of approximately $3.1 million based on our current level of borrowings.risk factors 17 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in shares of our class a common stock. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative or judicial restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of class a common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if the downturn in the u.s. insurance industry continues or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2011, approximately 52.0 % of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, sales of certain of our solutions are tied to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will 17 table of contents decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry; changes in technology; our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions; saturation of market demand; loss of key customers; industry consolidation; and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a continued downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our revenues from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the u.s mortgage market. revenue derived from solutions we provide the u.s. mortgage and mortgage-related industries accounted for approximately 10.0% of our total revenue in the year ended december 31, 2011. our forensic audits business and business with government-sponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 67.0% of our total mortgage and mortgage-related revenue in 2011. because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans, reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue. mortgage origination volumes in 2011 declined versus 2010. this decline may continue based on changes in the mortgage market related to the u.s. mortgage crisis. recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac. the restructuring or elimination of either fannie mae or freddie mac could have a negative effect on the u. s. mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry. if origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline, our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers. our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the u.s. mortgage crisis. certain mortgage insurers who have been operating under regulatory waivers of capital sufficiency requirements have announced that they are currently unable to write new mortgage insurance policies unless regulatory relief is provided. such a development could impact the volume of loans to be examined in our forensic audit business and could reduce our revenue and profitability. additionally, a withdrawal of mortgage insurers from the mortgage loan market could potentially reduce the volume of loan originations, which could reduce the revenue in our origination-related business. two customers represented the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2011 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace such volumes with new customers, our revenue may decline. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance services sector. any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 18 table of contents if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the united states, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analyses where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management time and attention. 19 table of contents if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver privacy protection act, health insurance portability and accountability act, the european union data protection directive and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. fraudulent data access and other security breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. in addition, customers misuse of our information services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; 20 table of contents affecting our ability to meet customers expectations; or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. the on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. 21 table of contents acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets; failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner; assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company; managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business; distracting management focus from our core businesses; difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses; impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners; incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets; incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under our uncommitted facilities, lenders are not required to loan us any funds under such facilities. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over twenty years. 22 table of contents however, with the exception of frank j. coyne, our chairman and chief executive officer, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust litigation. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. our liquidity, financial position and profitability could be adversely affected by further deterioration in u.s. and international credit markets and economic conditions. deterioration in the global capital markets has caused financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail. these conditions have led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, resulting in a contraction of available credit, even for the most credit-worthy borrowers. due to recent market events, our liquidity and our ability to obtain financing may be negatively impacted if one of our lenders under our revolving credit facilities or existing shelf arrangements fails to meet its funding obligations. in such an event, we may not be able to draw on all, or a substantial portion, of our uncommitted credit facilities, which would adversely affect our liquidity. also, if we attempt to obtain future financing in addition to, or replacement of, our existing credit facilities to finance our continued growth through acquisitions or otherwise, the credit market turmoil could negatively impact our ability to obtain such financing. 23 table of contents general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation. the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. in addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions. specifically, certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market. this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations. any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2011, our stockholders, who owned our shares prior to the ipo and follow-on offering, continue to beneficially own a portion of our class a common stock, primarily owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop, representing in aggregate approximately 13.1 % of our outstanding common stock. such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 17,834,361 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 24, 2012 . we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested 24 table of contents stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt; prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors; require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; authorize the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval, subject to the rules and regulations of the nasdaq global select market; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 55 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2011, we had no borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility, which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.250% to 1.875% depending on certain ratios defined in the credit facility. a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2011, a one percent change in interest rates would not result in a change in annual pretax interest expense based on our current level of borrowings.risk factors 17 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in shares of our class a common stock. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of class a common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2012, approximately 48.3% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, pricing of certain of our solutions are linked to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss 17 table of contents experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry; changes in technology; our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions; saturation of market demand; loss of key customers; industry consolidation; and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach a downturn in the insurance industry or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our revenues from customers in the mortgage vertical is largely transactional and subject to changing conditions of the u.s mortgage market. revenue derived from solutions we provide the u.s. mortgage and mortgage-related industries accounted for approximately 8.5% of our total revenue in the year ended december 31, 2012. our forensic audits business and business with government-sponsored entities in the mortgage business accounted for approximately 52.0% of our total mortgage and mortgage-related revenue in 2012. because our business relies on transaction volumes based on both new mortgage applications and forensic audit of funded loans, reductions in either the volume of mortgage loans originated or the number or quality of funded loans could reduce our revenue. recently there have been proposals to restructure or eliminate the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac. the restructuring or elimination of either fannie mae or freddie mac could have a negative effect on the u. s. mortgage market and on our revenue derived from the solutions we provide to the mortgage industry. if origination volumes and applications for mortgages decline, our revenue in this part of the business may decline if we are unable to increase the percentage of mortgages examined for existing customers or add new customers. our forensic audit business has benefited from the high amount of bad loans to be examined by mortgage insurers and other parties as a result of the u.s. mortgage crisis. certain mortgage insurers who have been operating under regulatory waivers of capital sufficiency requirements have announced that they are currently unable to write new mortgage insurance policies unless regulatory relief is provided. such a development could impact the volume of loans to be examined in our forensic audit business and could reduce our revenue and profitability. additionally, a withdrawal of mortgage insurers from the mortgage loan market could potentially reduce the volume of loan originations, which could reduce the revenue in our origination-related business. two customers represented the majority of our mortgage revenue in 2012 and if their volumes decline and we are not able to replace such volumes with new customers, our revenue may continue to decline. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance and healthcare services sector. any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 18 table of contents if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the united states, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analyses where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management time and attention. 19 table of contents if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver privacy protection act, health insurance portability and accountability act, the european union data protection directive, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. in addition, customers or other misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; 20 table of contents increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers expectations; or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. 21 table of contents acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets; failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner; assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company; managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business; distracting management focus from our core businesses; difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses; impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners; incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets; incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, much of our capacity is under our uncommitted facilities, under which lenders are not required to loan us any funds. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may not experience difficulty in achieving future growth. our acquisition of argus increased our leverage; in addition, we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. on august 31, 2012 we completed our acquisition of argus. in order to finance the acquisition we incurred $380.0 million of indebtedness under our lending credit facility. on august 31, 2012, our total debt increased to approximately $1,600.0 million and our leverage ratio (debt to ebitda (last twelve months proforma)) increased from 1.90x to 2.34x, and as of december 31, 2012 our total debt was approximately $1,461.4 million and our leverage ratio was 2.11x. our increased leverage resulting from the argus acquisition could adversely affect our business. in particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. in addition we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. 22 table of contents to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over twenty years. however, with the exception of frank j. coyne, our chairman and chief executive officer, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries failed to comply with the fair credit reporting act and related obligations. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation 23 table of contents could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation. the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. in addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions. specifically, certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market. this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations. any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2012, our stockholders, who owned our shares prior to the ipo and follow-on offering, continue to beneficially own a portion of our class a common stock, primarily owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop, representing in aggregate approximately 14.6% of our outstanding common stock. such stockholders will be able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 12,276,269 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 21, 2013. we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. 24 table of contents our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt; prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors; require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 53 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2012, we had borrowings outstanding under our syndicated revolving credit facility of $10.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.250% to 1.875% depending on certain ratios defined in the credit facility. a change in interest rates on this variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2012, a one percent change in interest rates would result in a change in annual pretax interest expense of $0.1 million based on our current level of borrowings.risk factors 15 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities including our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of class a common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2013 , approximately 47.4% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry; changes in technology; our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions; saturation of market demand; loss of key customers; industry consolidation; and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a downturn in the insurance industry, filing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: 15 table of contents failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets; failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner; assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company; managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business; distracting management focus from our core businesses; failing to retain management at acquired company; difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business; possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible and those that assets derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets; impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners; incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets; incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance and healthcare services sector. any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue,we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and 16 table of contents distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the united states, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, health insurance portability and accountability act, the european union's data protection directive, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of 17 table of contents proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. 18 table of contents our contemplated acquisition of eagleview technology corporation will increase our leverage; in addition, we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. on january 14, 2014, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire eagleview technology corporation ('evt'), the closing of which is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. in order to finance the acquisition we expect to incur approximately $475 million of indebtedness under our lending credit facility. upon closing of the transaction, our total debt will increase to approximately $1,756 million and our leverage ratio (debt to ebitda (last twelve months proforma)) will increase from 1.60 to approximately 2.15. our increased leverage resulting from the evt acquisition could adversely affect our business. in particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. in addition we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of over 18 years. however, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries failed to comply with the fair credit reporting act and related obligations. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation 19 table of contents could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation. the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. in addition, the decline of the credit markets has reduced the number of mortgage originators, and therefore, the immediate demand for our related mortgage solutions. specifically, certain of our fraud detection and prevention solutions are directed at the mortgage market. this decline in asset value and originations and an increase in foreclosure levels has also created greater regulatory scrutiny of mortgage originations and securitizations. any new regulatory regime may change the utility of our solutions for mortgage lenders and other participants in the mortgage lending industry and related derivative markets or increase our costs as we adapt our solutions to new regulation. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2013 , our ten largest shareholders owned 46.4% of our class a common stock including 8.9% of our class a common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,947,727 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 21, 2014 . we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt; prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors; require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; 20 table of contents prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 21 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 48 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2013 , we did not have any borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. any future borrowing under this facility would bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.125% to 1.875%, depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. as of december 31, 2013 , all of our debt is at fixed rates. 48 table of contentsrisk factors 15 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities including our class a common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of class a common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2014 , approximately 49.1% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry; changes in technology; our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions; saturation of market demand; loss of key customers; industry consolidation; and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: 15 table of contents failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets; failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner; assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company; managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business; distracting management focus from our core businesses; failing to retain management at acquired company; difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business; possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible assets that derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets; impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners; incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets; incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and would result in dilution. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance and healthcare services sector. any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and 16 table of contents distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the united states, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, health insurance portability and accountability act, the european union's data protection directive, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of 17 table of contents proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. 18 table of contents to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost 18 years. however, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation. the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial 19 table of contents condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2014 , our ten largest shareholders owned 48.7% of our class a common stock including 7.4% of our class a common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,986,583 shares of class a common stock were outstanding as of february 20, 2015 . we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt; prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors; require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 20 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 45 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2014 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $160.0 million, which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.125% to 1.625%, depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2014 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $1.6 million based on our current borrowing levels. 45 table of contentsrisk factors 15 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities including our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way which allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute sources. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2015 , approximately 44% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry; changes in technology; our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions; saturation of market demand; loss of key customers; industry consolidation; and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquirees. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: 15 table of contents failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies; paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets; failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner; assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company; managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business; distracting management focus from our core businesses; failing to retain management at acquired company; difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business; possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible assets that derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets; impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners; incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets; incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and would result in dilution. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which would reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance and healthcare services sector. any of these developments could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and 16 table of contents distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. business we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the united states, regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, health insurance portability and accountability act, the european union's data protection directive, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of 17 table of contents proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that requires significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the on-line services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our on-line servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection and price. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. 18 table of contents to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. members of our senior management operating team have been with us for an average of almost 15 years. however, we do not have employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become subject to further such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates and inflation. the united states economy recently experienced periods of contraction and both the future domestic and global economic environments may continue to be less favorable than those of prior years. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial 19 table of contents condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2015 , our ten largest shareholders owned 38.3% of our common stock including 5.7% of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 9,057,243 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 19, 2016 . we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt; prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors; require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; limit who may call special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. 20 table of contents we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of wood mackenzie. on may 19, 2015, we consummated the acquisition of wood mackenzie (the acquisition ). in order to finance the acquisition, we incurred $2,180.0 million of indebtedness. as of december 31, 2015, we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $3,168.0 million , and our leverage ratio (debt to ebitda) increased from 1.57x at march 31, 2015 to 2.89x. our increased leverage resulting from the acquisition could adversely affect our business. in particular, it could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue certain operational and strategic opportunities. the increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition. we may fail to realize all the expected benefits of the acquisition or successfully integrate wood mackenzie's operations or preserve its customers and employees in an efficient or timely manner. the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. this integration effort may also distract our management's focus from our existing core businesses or impair our existing relationships with employees, customers and our strategic partners. we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or long-term strategic benefits of the acquisition or could incur higher transition costs. an inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process or an inability to integrate the operations of the two companies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. general economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by wood mackenzie's customers for its products and services. demand for wood mackenzie's products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry. many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie's customers. such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources and other matters. a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie's customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations. wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom and conducts its principal operations outside the united states. as a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the united states has increased materially. conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war and other economic or political uncertainties. all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations. the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling. as a result of the acquisition, we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies. as exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results, when remeasured in u.s. dollars, may differ materially from expectations. although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. 21 table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 46 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2015 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $870.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.125% to 1.625% , depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2015 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $8.7 million based on our current borrowing levels. foreign currency risk our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates. a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in u.s. dollars would decline. with regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in u.s. dollars will increase. movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2015 . a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.risk factors 15 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities, including our common stock, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources, which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government, and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 15 table of contents we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2016 , approximately 48.9% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry, changes in technology, our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions, saturation of market demand, loss of key customers, industry consolidation, and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies, paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets, failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner, assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company, managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business, distracting management focus from our core businesses, failing to retain management at the acquired company, difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business, possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible assets that derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets, impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners, incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets, incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits, and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. 16 table of contents we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which could reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance sector. any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the u.s. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the u.s., regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or 17 table of contents operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, the european union's data protection directive, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. in addition, on october 6, 2015 the court of justice of the european union, or e.u., invalidated the safe harbor provisions used by the company and numerous other u.s. businesses to comply with e.u.'s data protection directive 95/46/ec. the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data protection directive, however, there can be no assurances that such methods will not be invalidated as well. if the company is unable to comply with the transfer mechanisms adopted pursuant to the data protection directive, it will impede the ability to conduct business between the u.s. and the e.u. which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. 18 table of contents we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection, and pricing. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings. our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws. however, changes in existing tax laws or rulings, including federal, state and international, could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate. furthermore, the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) released its base erosion and profit shifting (beps) action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results. in addition, our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. however, as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team, except for certain limited situations. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. 19 table of contents we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become further subject to such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs, which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates, and inflation. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of wood mackenzie. in order to finance acquisitions, which are an important part of our long term growth strategy , we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business. in particular, the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities. the increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. general economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by wood mackenzie's customers for its products and services. demand for wood mackenzie's products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry. many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie's customers. such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources, and other matters. a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie's customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations. wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom, or u.k., and conducts its principal operations outside the u.s. as a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the u.s. has increased materially. conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or 20 table of contents varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties. all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations. the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling. as a result of the acquisition, we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies. as exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, when remeasured in u.s. dollars, may differ materially from expectations. although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the results of the referendum on june 23, 2016 in the u.k., to exit the e.u., which is commonly referred to as brexit, and to potentially significantly change the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the u.k. and e.u. countries could disrupt the overall stability of the e.u. given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual e.u. countries and negatively impact our european operations. an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets, including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound. longer term, brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u., which could result in the u.k. losing access to certain aspects of the single e.u. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the e.u. on behalf of its members. the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the u.k. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the u.k., the e.u. and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2016 , our ten largest shareholders owned 39.6% of our common stock, including 5.1% of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,666,698 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 17, 2017 . we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be 21 table of contents beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt, prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors, require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, limit who may call special meetings of stockholders, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2016 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $100.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.125% to 1.625% , depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2016 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $1.0 million based on our current borrowing levels. foreign currency risk our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates. a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in u.s. dollars would decline. with regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in u.s. dollars will increase. movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2016 . a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.risk factors 15 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities, including our common stock, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources, which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government, and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. our systems may be vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. third-party contractors also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. in addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. 15 table of contents a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2017 , approximately 48.9% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry, changes in technology, our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions, saturation of market demand, loss of key customers, industry consolidation, and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies, paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets, failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner, assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company, managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business, distracting management focus from our core businesses, failing to retain management at the acquired company, difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business, possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible assets that derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets, impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners, 16 table of contents incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets, incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits, and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which could reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance sector. any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the u.s. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 17 table of contents we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the u.s., regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, the european union's data protection directive and its successor the general data protection regulation, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. in addition, on october 6, 2015 the court of justice of the european union, or e.u., invalidated the safe harbor provisions used by the company and numerous other u.s. businesses to comply with e.u.'s data protection directive 95/46/ec. the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data protection directive and the forthcoming general data protection regulation, however, there can be no assurances that such methods will not be invalidated as well. if the company is unable to comply with the transfer mechanisms adopted pursuant to the data protection directive and the forthcoming general data protection regulation, it will impede the ability to conduct business between the u.s. and the e.u. which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 18 table of contents we may lose key business assets, through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection, and pricing. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings. our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws. however, changes in existing tax laws or rulings, including federal, state and international, could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate. furthermore, the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) released its base erosion and profit shifting (beps) action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results. in addition, our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. however, as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team, except for certain limited situations. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 19 table of contents we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become further subject to such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs, which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle such litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to similar litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates, and inflation. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. we incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of wood mackenzie. in order to finance acquisitions, which are an important part of our long term growth strategy, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business. in particular, the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities. the increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. general economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by wood mackenzie's customers for its products and services. demand for wood mackenzie's products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry. many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie's customers. such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources, and other matters. a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, 20 table of contents particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie's customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations. wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom, or u.k., and conducts its principal operations outside the u.s. as a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the u.s. has increased materially. conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties. all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations. the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling. as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie, we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies. as exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, when remeasured in u.s. dollars, may differ materially from expectations. although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the results of the referendum on june 23, 2016 in the u.k., to exit the e.u., which is commonly referred to as brexit, and to potentially significantly change the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the u.k. and e.u. countries could disrupt the overall stability of the e.u. given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual e.u. countries and negatively impact our european operations. an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets, including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound. longer term, brexit will require negotiations regarding the future terms of the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u., which could result in the u.k. losing access to certain aspects of the single e.u. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the e.u. on behalf of its members. the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the u.k. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the u.k., the e.u. and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2017 , our ten largest shareholders owned 41.0% of our common stock, including 4.4% of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 8,703,249 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 16, 2018 . we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares 21 table of contents available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt, prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors, require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, limit who may call special meetings of stockholders, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 50 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2017 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $715.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.125% to 1.625% , depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2017 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $7.2 million based on our current borrowing levels. foreign currency risk our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates. a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in u.s. dollars would decline. with regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in u.s. dollars will increase. movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2017 . a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.risk factors 15 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities, including our common stock, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources, which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government, and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers are significant stockholders of our company. specifically, a portion of common stock is owned by insurers who are also our customers. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases in the future, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other cyber-security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. many of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. as with other global companies, our systems are regularly subject to cyber-attacks, cyber-threats, physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. as cyber-threats continue to evolve, we are required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and incidents. despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate or detect all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. cyber-threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate, prevent or detect all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber-incidents, no cyber-attack or other cyber-incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date. third-party contractors, including cloud-based service providers, also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. in addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. 15 table of contents a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third-party suppliers, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2018 , approximately 47% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry, changes in technology, our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions, saturation of market demand, loss of key customers, industry consolidation, and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful investments. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies, 16 table of contents paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets, failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner, assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company, managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business, distracting management focus from our core businesses, failing to retain management at the acquired company, difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business, possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible assets that derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets, impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners, incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets, incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits, and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which could reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance sector. any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. 17 table of contents we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the u.s. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the u.s., regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we have, from time-to-time, been subject to litigation alleging intellectual property infringement. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, the european union's general data protection regulation, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data privacy and protection principles of the european union's general data protection regulation, however, there can be no assurances that such methods will be deemed fully compliant. if the company is unable to comply with the data privacy and protection principles adopted pursuant to the general data protection regulation, it will impede our ability to conduct business between the u.s. and the e.u. which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: 18 table of contents amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers, whether in cloud or dedicated environments, and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our or our third-party service provider's data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection, and pricing. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 19 table of contents our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings. our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws. however, changes in existing tax laws or rulings, including federal, state and international, could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate. furthermore, the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) released its base erosion and profit shifting (beps) action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results. in addition, our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. however, as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team, except for certain limited situations. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become further subject to such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs, which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates, and inflation. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the 20 table of contents value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions. in order to finance acquisitions, which are an important part of our long term growth strategy, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business. in particular, the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities. the increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. general economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by wood mackenzie's customers for its products and services. demand for wood mackenzie's products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry. many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie's customers. such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources, and other matters. a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie's customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations. wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom, or u.k., and conducts its principal operations outside the u.s. as a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the u.s. has increased materially. conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties. all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations. the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling. as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie and other recent acquisitions outside of the u.s., we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies. as exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, when remeasured in u.s. dollars, may differ materially from expectations. although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the results of the referendum on june 23, 2016 in the u.k., to exit the e.u., which is commonly referred to as brexit, and to potentially significantly change the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the u.k. and e.u. countries could disrupt the overall stability of the e.u. given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual e.u. countries and negatively impact our european operations. an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets, including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound. longer term, the ongoing negotiations regarding the future terms of the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. could result in the u.k. losing access to certain aspects of the single e.u. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the e.u. on behalf of its members. while the u.k. is currently expected to leave the e.u. on 21 table of contents march 29, 2019, uncertainty remains as to the exact timing and process. the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the u.k. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the u.k., the e.u. and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2018 , our ten largest shareholders owned 41.2% of our common stock, including 3.9% of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 6,730,288 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 15, 2019. we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt, prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors, require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, limit who may call special meetings of stockholders, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. 22 table of contents these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 48 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2018, we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $415.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.125% to 1.625% depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2018 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $4.2 million based on our current borrowing levels. foreign currency risk our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates. a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in u.s. dollars would decline. with regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in u.s. dollars will increase. movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2018 . a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.risk factors 15 risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10-k before deciding to invest in any of our securities. if any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. in such case, the trading price of our securities, including our common stock, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. we could lose our access to data from external sources, which could prevent us from providing our solutions. we depend upon data from external sources, including data received from customers and various government, and public record services, for information used in our databases. in general, we do not own the information in these databases, and the participating organizations could discontinue contributing information to the databases. our data sources could withdraw or increase the price for their data for a variety of reasons, and we could also become subject to legislative, judicial, or contractual restrictions on the use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by the third parties in a way that allows us to legally use and/or process the data. in addition, some of our customers have been, and in the future may continue to be, stockholders of our company. if our customers' percentage of ownership of our common stock decreases, or they cease to be stockholders of our company, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide data to the same extent or on the same terms. if a substantial number of data sources, or certain key sources, were to withdraw or be unable to provide their data, or if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation or if the collection of data became uneconomical, our ability to provide solutions to our customers could be impacted, which could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. agreements with our data suppliers are short-term agreements. some suppliers are also competitors, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases and may cause some suppliers not to renew certain agreements. our competitors could also enter into exclusive contracts with our data sources. if our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data, which would give our competitors an advantage. such a termination or exclusive contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results if we were unable to arrange for substitute data sources. fraudulent or unpermitted data access and other cyber-security or privacy breaches may negatively impact our business and harm our reputation. security breaches in our facilities, computer networks, and databases may cause harm to our business and reputation and result in a loss of customers. many of our solutions involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. as with other global companies, our systems are regularly subject to cyber-attacks, cyber-threats, physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar disruptive problems. as cyber-threats continue to evolve, we are required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures and to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities and incidents. despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate or detect all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. cyber-threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate, prevent or detect all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber-incidents, no cyber-attack or other cyber-incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date. third-party contractors, including cloud-based service providers, also may experience security breaches involving the storage and transmission of proprietary information. if users gain improper access to our databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify confidential third-party information that is stored or transmitted on our networks. our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. in addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks. in addition, customers', employees' or other's misuse of and/or gaining unpermitted access to or failure to properly secure our information or services could cause harm to our business and reputation and result in loss of customers. any such misappropriation and/or misuse of or failure to properly secure our information could result in us, among other things, being in breach of certain data protection and related legislation. 15 table of contents a security or privacy breach may affect us in the following ways: deterring customers from using our solutions; deterring data suppliers from supplying data to us; harming our reputation; exposing us to liability; increasing operating expenses to correct problems caused by the breach; affecting our ability to meet customers' expectations; and/or causing inquiry from governmental authorities. incidents in which consumer data has been fraudulently or improperly acquired or viewed, or any other security or privacy breaches, may occur and could go undetected. the number of potentially affected consumers identified by any future incidents is obviously unknown. any such incident could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. in addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of our third-party suppliers, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our reputation and materially impact our business. we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. if there is a downturn in the u.s. insurance industry or that industry does not continue to accept our solutions, our revenues will decline. revenues derived from solutions we provide to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. during the year ended december 31, 2019 , approximately 49% of our revenue was derived from solutions provided to u.s. p&amp;c primary insurers. also, invoices for certain of our solutions are linked in part to premiums in the u.s. p&amp;c insurance market, which may rise or fall in any given year due to loss experience and capital capacity and other factors in the insurance industry that are beyond our control. in addition, our revenues will decline if the insurance industry does not continue to accept our solutions. factors that might affect the acceptance of these solutions by p&amp;c primary insurers include the following: changes in the business analytics industry, changes in technology, our inability to obtain or use state fee schedule or claims data in our insurance solutions, saturation of market demand, loss of key customers, industry consolidation, and failure to execute our customer-focused selling approach. a downturn in the insurance industry, pricing pressure or lower acceptance of our solutions by the insurance industry could result in a decline in revenues from that industry and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. acquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other harmful consequences, and we may not be successful in achieving growth through acquisitions. our long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. future acquisitions may not be completed on acceptable terms and acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations, and we may ultimately divest unsuccessful acquisitions or investments. any acquisitions or investments will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in the acquisitions of businesses. such risks include, among other things: failing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies, 16 table of contents paying more than fair market value for an acquired company or assets, failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner, assuming potential liabilities of an acquired company, managing the potential disruption to our ongoing business, distracting management focus from our core businesses, failing to retain management at the acquired company, difficulty in acquiring suitable businesses, including challenges in predicting the value an acquisition will ultimately contribute to our business, possibility of overpaying for acquisitions, particularly those with significant intangible assets that derive value using novel tools and/or are involved in niche markets, impairing relationships with employees, customers, and strategic partners, incurring expenses associated with the amortization of intangible assets particularly for intellectual property and other intangible assets, incurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to changes in market conditions, weak economies in certain competitive markets, or the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits, and diluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders. the anticipated benefits of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. future acquisitions or dispositions could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our financial condition. we typically fund our acquisitions through our debt facilities. although we have capacity under committed facilities, those may not be sufficient. therefore, future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional financing through debt or equity, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all and could result in dilution. in addition, to the extent we cannot identify or consummate, on terms acceptable to us, acquisitions that are complementary or otherwise attractive to our business, we may experience difficulty in achieving future growth. there may be consolidation in our end customer market, which could reduce the use of our services. mergers or consolidations among our customers could reduce the number of our customers and potential customers. this could adversely affect our revenues even if these events do not reduce the aggregate number of customers or the activities of the consolidated entities. if our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. the adverse effects of consolidation will be greater in sectors that we are particularly dependent upon, for example, in the p&amp;c insurance sector. any of these developments could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. if we are unable to develop successful new solutions or if we experience defects, failures and delays associated with the introduction of new solutions, our business could suffer serious harm. our growth and success depends upon our ability to develop and sell new solutions. if we are unable to develop new solutions, or if we are not successful in introducing and/or obtaining regulatory approval or acceptance for new solutions, or products we develop face sufficient pricing pressure to make them unattractive to pursue, we may not be able to grow our business, or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate. in addition, significant undetected errors or delays in new solutions may affect market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. in the past, we have experienced delays while developing and introducing new solutions, primarily due to difficulties in developing models, acquiring data and adapting to particular operating environments. errors or defects in our solutions that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection of our solutions, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, diversion of development resources, an increase in product liability claims, and increases in service and support costs and warranty claims. 17 table of contents we will continue to rely upon proprietary technology rights, and if we are unable to protect them, our business could be harmed. our success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. to date, we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying and distribution to protect our proprietary technology. this protection of our proprietary technology is limited, and our proprietary technology could be used by others without our consent. in addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. businesses we acquire also often involve intellectual property portfolios, which increase the challenges we face in protecting our strategic advantage. any disclosure, loss, invalidity of, or failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our competitive position, and ultimately, our business. our protection of our intellectual property rights in the u.s. or abroad may not be adequate and others, including our competitors, may use our proprietary technology without our consent. furthermore, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. we could face claims for intellectual property infringement, which if successful could restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions to our customers. there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings, particularly in the u.s., regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the information technology industry. there is a risk that we are infringing, or may in the future infringe, the intellectual property rights of third parties. we have, from time-to-time, been subject to litigation alleging intellectual property infringement. we monitor third-party patents and patent applications that may be relevant to our technologies and solutions and we carry out freedom to operate analysis where we deem appropriate. however, such monitoring and analysis has not been, and is unlikely in the future to be, comprehensive, and it may not be possible to detect all potentially relevant patents and patent applications. since the patent application process can take several years to complete, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and technologies. as a result, we may infringe existing and future third-party patents of which we are not aware. as we expand our operations there is a higher risk that such activity could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. third-party intellectual property infringement claims and any resultant litigation against us or our technology partners or providers, could subject us to liability for damages, restrict us from using and providing our technologies and solutions or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies and solutions. even if we prevail, litigation is time consuming and expensive to defend and would result in the diversion of management's time and attention. if a successful claim of infringement is brought against us and we fail to develop non-infringing technologies and solutions or to obtain licenses on a timely and cost effective basis, this could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. regulatory developments could negatively impact our business. because personal, public and non-public information is stored in some of our databases, we are vulnerable to government regulation and adverse publicity concerning the use of our data. we provide many types of data and services that already are subject to regulation under the fair credit reporting act, gramm-leach-bliley act, driver's privacy protection act, the european union's general data protection regulation, the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and to a lesser extent, various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. these laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of the public and to prevent the misuse of personal information in the marketplace. however, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates, and government regulators believe that the existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy. they have become increasingly concerned with the use of personal information, particularly social security numbers, department of motor vehicle data and dates of birth. as a result, they are lobbying for further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors. similar initiatives are under way in other countries in which we do business or from which we source data. the company has implemented various measures to comply with the data privacy and protection principles of the european union's general data protection regulation, however, there can be no assurances that such methods will be deemed fully compliant. if the company is unable to comply with the data privacy and protection principles adopted pursuant to the general data protection regulation, it will impede our ability to conduct business between the u.s. and the e.u. which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. the following legal and regulatory developments also could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows: 18 table of contents amendment, enactment, or interpretation of laws and regulations which restrict the access and use of personal information and reduce the supply of data available to customers; changes in cultural and consumer attitudes to favor further restrictions on information collection and sharing, which may lead to regulations that prevent full utilization of our solutions; failure of our solutions to comply with current and future laws and regulations; and failure of our solutions to adapt to changes in the regulatory environment in an efficient, cost-effective manner. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure new contracts that require significant resource commitments, which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships. we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract and there is generally a long preparation period in order to commence providing the services. we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle and we may not succeed in winning a new customer's business, in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses. even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new customer, we may not be successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle or in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may lose key business assets, through the loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links, the internet, or power sources, which could significantly impede our ability to do business. our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of third-party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions, to protect data centers, whether in cloud or dedicated environments, and related technology against damage from hardware failure, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, impacts of terrorism, breaches in security (such as the actions of computer hackers), natural disasters, or other disasters. certain of our facilities are located in areas that could be impacted by coastal flooding, earthquakes or other disasters. the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers. in addition, we generate a significant amount of our revenues through telesales centers and websites that we utilize in the acquisition of new customers, fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries. we may not have sufficient redundant operations to cover a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner. certain of our customer contracts provide that our online servers may not be unavailable for specified periods of time. any damage to our or our third-party service provider's data centers, failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or websites could cause interruptions in operations that materially adversely affect our ability to meet customers' requirements, resulting in decreased revenue, operating income and earnings per share. we are subject to competition in many of the markets in which we operate and we may not be able to compete effectively. some markets in which we operate or which we believe may provide growth opportunities for us are highly competitive, and are expected to remain highly competitive. we compete on the basis of quality, customer service, product and service selection, and pricing. our competitive position in various market segments depends upon the relative strength of competitors in the segment and the resources devoted to competing in that segment. due to their size, certain competitors may be able to allocate greater resources to a particular market segment than we can. as a result, these competitors may be in a better position to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences, emerging technologies and market trends. in addition, new competitors and alliances may emerge to take market share away, and as we enter into new lines of business, due to acquisition or otherwise, we face competition from new players with different competitive dynamics. we may be unable to maintain our competitive position in our market segments, especially against larger competitors. we may also invest further to upgrade our systems in order to compete. if we fail to successfully compete, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. to the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our solutions may decrease. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the internet, and this trend is expected to continue. governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce the demand for our solutions. to the extent that customers choose not to obtain solutions from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 19 table of contents our financial position may be impacted by audit examinations or changes in tax laws or tax rulings. our existing corporate structure and tax positions have been implemented in a manner in which we believe is compliant with current prevailing tax laws. however, changes in existing tax laws or rulings, including federal, state and international, could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, cash tax positions and deferred tax assets and liabilities. audit examinations with an adverse outcome could have a negative effect in the jurisdictions in which we operate. furthermore, the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) released its base erosion and profit shifting (beps) action plans which may also lead to future tax reform that could affect our results. in addition, our tax positions are impacted by fluctuations in our earnings and financial results in the various countries in which we do business. our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business. our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. however, as a general practice we do not enter into employee contracts with the members of our senior management operating team, except for certain limited situations. if we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers. our business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. if our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry, but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. if our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. increased competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our customers, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs. we are subject to antitrust, consumer protection and other litigation, and may in the future become further subject to such litigation; an adverse outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. we participate in businesses (particularly insurance-related businesses and services) that are subject to substantial litigation, including antitrust and consumer protection litigation. in addition, our insurance specialists are in the business of providing advice on standard contract terms, which if challenged could expose us to substantial reputational harm and possible liability. we are subject to the provisions of a 1995 settlement agreement in an antitrust lawsuit brought by various state attorneys general and private plaintiffs, which imposes certain constraints with respect to insurer involvement in our governance and business. we currently are defending against putative class action lawsuits in which it is alleged that certain of our subsidiaries unlawfully have conspired with insurers with respect to their payment of insurance claims. see item 3. legal proceedings. our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenues and profitability. given the nature of our business, we may be subject to litigation in the future. even if the direct financial impact of such litigation is not material, settlements or judgments arising out of such litigation could include further restrictions on our ability to conduct business, including potentially the elimination of entire lines of business, which could increase our cost of doing business and limit our prospects for future growth. general economic, political and market forces and dislocations beyond our control could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. the demand for our solutions may be impacted by domestic and international factors that are beyond our control, including macroeconomic, political and market conditions, the availability of short-term and long-term funding and capital, the level and volatility of interest rates, currency exchange rates, and inflation. any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced activity and prices in the securities markets generally and could result in a reduction in demand for our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. a significant additional decline in the 20 table of contents value of assets for which risk is transferred in market transactions could have an adverse impact on the demand for our solutions. we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions. in order to finance acquisitions, which are an important part of our long term growth strategy, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness and such increased leverage could adversely affect our business. in particular, the increased leverage could increase our vulnerability to sustained, adverse macroeconomic weakness, limit our ability to obtain further financing and limit our ability to pursue other operational and strategic opportunities. the increased leverage, potential lack of access to financing and increased expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. general economic uncertainties, including downward trends in the energy industry, could reduce demand by wood mackenzie's customers for its products and services. demand for wood mackenzie's products and services may be negatively influenced by general economic uncertainties, particularly any downward trends in the energy industry. many factors could negatively affect the revenues, profits and discretionary spending of wood mackenzie's customers. such factors include commodity prices (in particular, oil and coal), the state of the local economy, interest rates, currency exchange rates, political uncertainty or restrictions and regulations, the availability of industry resources, and other matters. a downturn or perceived downturn in the economy, particularly the energy industry, could add pricing pressure, delay subscription renewals or lead to more challenging or protracted fee negotiations or generally lower acceptance of our solutions by wood mackenzie's customers, which could cause a decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. our operations are subject to additional risks inherent in international operations. wood mackenzie is based in the united kingdom, or u.k., and conducts its principal operations outside the u.s. as a result, the percentage of our revenues generated outside of the u.s. has increased materially. conducting extensive international operations subjects us to risks that are inherent in international operations, including challenges posed by different pricing environments and different forms of competition; lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions; differing technology standards; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; difficulties in managing and staffing international operations; varying expectations as to employee standards; potentially adverse tax consequences, including possible restrictions on the repatriation of earnings; and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries. moreover, international operations could be interrupted and negatively affected by economic changes, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, and other economic or political uncertainties. all of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. we are subject to the increased risk of exchange rate fluctuations. the revenues and costs of wood mackenzie are primarily denominated in pound sterling. as a result of our acquisition of wood mackenzie and other recent acquisitions outside of the u.s., we face greater exposure to movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. our operating results could be negatively affected depending on the amount of revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies. as exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and other operating results, when remeasured in u.s. dollars, may differ materially from expectations. although we may apply certain strategies to mitigate foreign currency risk, these strategies may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and would involve costs and risks of their own, such as ongoing management time and expertise, external costs to implement the strategies and potential accounting implications. economic and political instability and potential unfavorable changes in laws and regulations resulting from the u.k.'s exit from the e.u. could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the results of the referendum on june 23, 2016 in the u.k., to exit the e.u., which is commonly referred to as brexit, and to potentially significantly change the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. and the laws and regulations impacting business conducted between the u.k. and e.u. countries could disrupt the overall stability of the e.u. given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual e.u. countries and negatively impact our european operations. an immediate consequence of the brexit vote was an adverse impact to global markets, including currency markets which experienced a sharp drop in the value of the british pound. longer term, the ongoing uncertainty regarding the future terms of the u.k.'s relationship with the e.u. could result in the u.k. losing access to certain aspects of the single e.u. market and the global trade deals negotiated by the e.u. on behalf of its members. while the u.k. formally exited the e.u. on january 31, 21 table of contents 2020, uncertainty remains as to the process and future relationship between the u.k. and the e.u. the brexit process and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the u.k. may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the u.k., the e.u. and elsewhere, the impact of which could have an adverse effect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. if there are substantial sales of our common stock, our stock price could decline. the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem attractive. as of december 31, 2019 , our ten largest shareholders owned 41.6% of our common stock, including 4.7% of our common stock owned by our employee stock ownership plan or esop. such stockholders are able to sell their common stock in the public market from time to time without registration, and subject to limitations on the timing, amount and method of those sales imposed by securities laws. if any of these stockholders were to sell a large number of their common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. in addition, the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common stock. pursuant to our equity incentive plans, options to purchase approximately 7,064,380 shares of common stock were outstanding as of february 14, 2020 . we filed a registration statement under the securities act, which covers the shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans (including for such outstanding options) as well as shares held for resale by our existing stockholders that were previously issued under our equity incentive plans. such further issuance and resale of our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to decline. also, in the future, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. the amount of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then outstanding common stock. our capital structure, level of indebtedness and the terms of anti-takeover provisions under delaware law and in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could diminish the value of our common stock and could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult or could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors. we are a delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. in addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable or make it more difficult for stockholders to replace directors even if stockholders consider it beneficial to do so. our certificate of incorporation and bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to thwart a takeover attempt, prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors, require that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office, limit who may call special meetings of stockholders, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. in addition, section 203 of the delaware general corporation law may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us. as a public company, we are subject to section 203, which regulates corporate acquisitions and limits the ability of a holder of 15.0% or more of our stock from acquiring the rest of our stock. under delaware law, a corporation may opt out of the anti-takeover provisions, but we do not intend to do so. 22 table of contents these provisions may prevent a stockholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. at december 31, 2019 , we had borrowings outstanding under our credit facility of $495.0 million , which bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus 1.0% to 1.625% depending on certain ratios defined in the credit agreement. a change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax income and cash flows, but does not impact the fair value of the instruments. based on our overall interest rate exposure at december 31, 2019 , a one percent change in interest rate would result in a change in annual pre-tax interest expense of approximately $5.0 million based on our current borrowing levels. we have started to consider the implications of the transition of libor to alternative reference rate measures that will likely become effective post december 2021. we believe that there is still some uncertainty over what these rates will be but one possibility for u.s. dollar libor would be the secured overnight financing rate ("sofr"). as this decision has not been finalized at the time of amending our credit facility agreement, there is no definitive alternative rate proposed in the current contract. we are, however, reviewing the potential impact on the application of this rate on our interest expense once it becomes applicable. as our only current contract extending beyond 2021, that is subject to the libor rate is the credit facility, the impact will be dependent on what the outstanding borrowing amount is on the credit facility and the relevant interest rate that will be contractually applicable. should we amend our credit facility to reflect sofr, based on recent borrowings and applicable sofr, we do not anticipate to have a material impact on the business. foreign currency risk our foreign-based businesses and results of operations are exposed to movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates. a portion of our revenue is denominated in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against british pounds and other foreign currencies, our revenues reported in u.s. dollars would decline. with regard to operating expense, our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk relates to operating expense incurred in british pounds and other foreign currencies. if british pounds and other foreign currencies strengthen, costs reported in u.s. dollars will increase. movements in the u.s. dollar to british pounds and other foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material effect on our revenue for the year ended december 31, 2019 . a hypothetical ten percent change in average exchange rates versus the u.s. dollar would not have resulted in a material change to our earnings.
