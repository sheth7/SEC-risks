risk factors 11 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the continued uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. while the global economy has shown improvement, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions. weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years, causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs, including their research and development budgets, which capture spending on electronic design automation (eda) products and services. further uncertainty caused by a global recession could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. continuing caution by semiconductor companies could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored. events such as the timing and execution of the tapering of asset purchases by the u.s. federal reserve may continue to drive stock market and interest rate volatility, consumer confidence and product demand. in addition, should further economic instability affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations, it could adversely affect our financial results and our business. accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. if economic conditions deteriorate in the future, or, in particular, if the semiconductor industry does not grow, our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the eda industry as a whole, and our business in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits, and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party intellectual property (ip), whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for 11 table of contents use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business; the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies; negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of accounting standards codification (asc) 805, business combinations ; and requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business. if we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. for example, we recently completed our acquisition of coverity, inc. (coverity), a leading provider of software quality, testing, and security tools. this is a new, though adjacent, technology space for us. coverity's customer base is more diverse and includes industries with which we do not have experience. we may need to develop new sales and marketing strategies and meet new customer service requirements. at the same time, coverity competes with different competitors from those for our existing products, and these competitors may have more financial resources, industry experience or established customer relationships than we do. to successfully develop our coverity offerings, we will need to skillfully balance our investment in the software quality, testing and security tools space with investment in our existing products, as well as attract and retain employees with expertise in these new fields. if we fail to do so, we may not realize the expected benefits of the coverity acquisition, and it may have a negative effect on our earnings and financial condition. 12 table of contents consolidation among our customers, as well as within the industries in which we operate, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. changes in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. a change in existing principles, standards or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes. for example, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) is currently working together with the international accounting standards board (iasb) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow u.s. gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards (ifrs). in connection with this initiative, the fasb issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in may 2014 accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)" that supersedes nearly all existing u.s. gaap revenue recognition guidance. although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions. adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. further efforts by the fasb and iasb to converge u.s. gaap and ifrs accounting principles may have a material impact on the way we report financial results in areas including, but not limited to, lease accounting and financial statement presentation. in addition, the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for u.s. companies. changes in accounting principles from u.s. gaap to ifrs, or to converged accounting principles, may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; 13 table of contents our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes to our effective tax rate; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate, due to factors that include: cancellations or changes in levels of license orders or the mix between upfront license revenue and time-based license revenue; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront license revenue; delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method; delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development that customers have paid for early access to; customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; the levels of our hardware revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements, and which may also impact our levels of excess and obsolete inventory expenses; and changes in or challenges to our revenue recognition model. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation. we also compete with other eda vendors, including frequent new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the integrated circuit (ic) design process, as well as vendors of ip products and system-level solutions. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; 14 table of contents our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes, changes in our geographical earnings mix, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns, or by material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. in addition, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project being undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd). the oecd, which represents a coalition of member countries, is contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. these contemplated changes, if finalized and adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in the u.s., a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because 15 table of contents of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made. forecasting our annual effective tax rate is highly complex, as it depends on forward-looking financial projections of our annual income and geographical mix of earnings, our interpretations of the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions, and the possible outcomes of tax audits, among other estimates and assumptions. some items cannot be forecasted or may be treated as discrete to the future periods when they occur. if our estimates and assumptions prove incorrect, then there may be a material difference between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. in addition, we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and certain state tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant, or even any, revenue. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights; international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers; additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations. 16 table of contents any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2014 , approximately 83.6% of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries in their own accounts outside the united states. at present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, to the extent they are derived from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. as of october 31, 2014 , we had outstanding debt of $75.0 million under our $150 million term loan facility and no outstanding debt under our $350 million revolving credit facility. in december 2014, we drew down $250.0 million under our revolving credit facility. should our u.s. cash spending needs rise and exceed these liquidity sources, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. for example, we and emulation &amp; verification engineering s.a. (eve), a company we acquired in october 2012, are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation. the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately $36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement, which we plan to appeal. further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . in addition, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 17 table of contents cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our coverity security testing solutions. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. we recently began offering software quality and security testing solutions as a result of our acquisition of coverity. cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently, and often go undetected until after an attack has been launched. if we fail to identify these new and complex methods of attack, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our coverity security testing products may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our coverity products and could result in a loss of customers, sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our acquisition of coverity may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding material pending lawsuits, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. in addition, we are required under u.s. gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results of operations for employee share-based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan, which increases the pressure to limit equity-based compensation. these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. 18 table of contents our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other new regulations, including "conflict minerals" regulations affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets. our cash equivalent portfolio currently consists of tax-exempt money market mutual funds, taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits. in general, our investment portfolio may carry both interest rate risk and credit risk. we may hold fixed rate debt securities that can have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, or floating rate securities that may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. 19 table of contents catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2014 , all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair

internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 20 months. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2014 , the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $11.8 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $11.8 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $11.8 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. 42 table of contents net unrealized losses of approximately $11.1 million and $1.8 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides

equity risk. we have approximately $10.9 million and $11.5 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. during fiscal 2014 and 2013 , we did not write down the value of our investment portfolio. none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 44 table of contentsrisk factors 11 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the electronic design automation (eda) industry as a whole, and our eda and intellectual property (ip) product sales in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits, and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. consolidation among our customers, as well as within the industries in which we operate, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. the continued uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. while the global economy has shown improvement, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions. weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years, causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs, including their research and development budgets, which capture spending on eda products and services. further uncertainty caused by deteriorating global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. continuing caution by semiconductor companies could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 11 table of contents we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored. in addition, should further economic instability affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations, it could adversely affect our financial results and our business. accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. if economic conditions deteriorate in the future, or, in particular, if the semiconductor industry does not grow, our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business; the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies; negative impact on our earnings resulting from acquisition-related costs; and requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business. if we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. for example, we have recently acquired several providers of software quality and security testing tools, including coverity, inc. and codenomicon oy. this is a new, though adjacent, technology space for us. the customers for 12 table of contents these tools are diverse and include industries with which we do not have experience. we may need to develop new sales and marketing strategies and meet new customer service requirements. we will need to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in the field, such as identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages. at the same time, we will need to compete against new and unfamiliar competitors that may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, or established customer relationships than we do. to successfully develop our software quality and security offerings, we will need to skillfully balance our investment in the space with investment in our existing products, as well as attract and retain employees with expertise in these new fields. if we fail to do so, we may not realize the expected benefits of our acquisitions, and it may have a negative effect on our earnings and financial condition. changes in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap). these principles are subject to interpretation by the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. a change in existing principles, standards or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our operational processes. for example, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) is currently working together with the international accounting standards board (iasb) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow u.s. gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards (ifrs). in connection with this initiative, the fasb issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in may 2014 - accounting standards update (asu) 2014-09, "revenue from contracts with customers (topic 606)" - that supersedes nearly all existing u.s. gaap revenue recognition guidance and will be effective for fiscal 2019. although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of asu 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions. adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. further efforts by the fasb and iasb to converge u.s. gaap and ifrs accounting principles may have a material impact on the way we report financial results in areas including, but not limited to, lease accounting and financial statement presentation. in addition, the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for u.s. companies. changes in accounting principles from u.s. gaap to ifrs, or to converged accounting principles, may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; 13 table of contents our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes to our effective tax rate; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which include a sole supplier for certain hardware components; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate, due to factors that include: cancellations or changes in levels of license orders or the mix between upfront license revenue and time-based license revenue; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront license revenue; delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method; delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development that customers have paid for early access to; customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; the levels of our hardware revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements, and which may also impact our levels of excess and obsolete inventory expenses; and changes in our revenue recognition model. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it harder for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation. we also compete with other eda vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the integrated circuit (ic) design process, as well as vendors of ip products and system-level solutions. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our ip products. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. 14 table of contents we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes, changes in our geographical earnings mix, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns, or by material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. for example, a recent u.s. tax court ruling may change the way stock-based compensation costs are treated in cost sharing arrangements with subsidiaries, which if upheld, could affect our effective tax rate and cash flow. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. in addition, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. if our expectations regarding reinvestment of such earnings changes, then our income tax expense would increase. 15 table of contents further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), which represents a coalition of member countries. on october 5, 2015, the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. it is likely that some or all of these recommendations will be adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. in addition, the republic of ireland has changed its corporate residence rules and will require changes to our tax position by january 1, 2021. changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in the u.s., a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made. forecasting our annual effective tax rate is highly complex, as it depends on forward-looking financial projections of our annual income and geographical mix of earnings, our interpretations of the tax laws of numerous jurisdictions, and the possible outcomes of tax audits, among other estimates and assumptions. some items cannot be forecasted or may be treated as discrete to the future periods when they occur. if our estimates and assumptions prove incorrect, then there may be a material difference between our forecasted and actual effective tax rates, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. in addition, we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and certain state tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant, or even any, revenue. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights; international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; 16 table of contents government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers; additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. for example, in october 2015, we discovered unauthorized third-party access, which had begun in july 2015, to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system. we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed. no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system. while we identified and closed the method used to gain access, and do not expect the incident to impact our financial results, it is possible our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and such a breach could harm our business and reputation. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. our software products may also be vulnerable to cyberattacks. an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, and other destructive outcomes. as a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we recently began offering software quality and security testing solutions as a result of our acquisitions of coverity and codenomicon. if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyberattack, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products may 17 table of contents fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and could result in a loss of customers, sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our acquisitions of coverity and codenomicon may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2015 , approximately 83.9% of our worldwide cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance is held by our international subsidiaries. at present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, to the extent they derive from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs primarily through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. as of october 31, 2015 , we had outstanding debt of $45.0 million under our $150.0 million term loan facility and $160.0 million of outstanding debt under our $500.0 million revolving credit facility. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. for example, we and emulation &amp; verification engineering s.a. (eve), a company we acquired in october 2012, are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation. the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately $36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement, and the court in the lawsuit has entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe. we have appealed from the injunction and the final judgment in the case. further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . in addition, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding material pending lawsuits, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . 18 table of contents we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results. we license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. we also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. if we are unable to obtain licenses to this third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development process and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation. the inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management attention. some of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business. if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. if we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other new regulations, including "conflict minerals" regulations affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues 19 table of contents and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets. our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio currently consists of investment-grade u.s. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer's credit quality or changes in interest rates. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk . our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2015 , all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the following tables present our cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates: as of october 31, 2015 maturing in year ending october 31, 2016 2017 2018 total fair value (in thousands) cash &amp; cash equivalent (variable rate) $ 584,446 $ $ $ 584,446 $ 584,446

available for sale securities are: fair value (in thousands) due in 1 year or less $ 76,784 due in 2-5 years 51,871 due in 5-10 years 92 total $ 128,747 actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. these investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or oci. the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period presented. the following table presents the amounts of our short-term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of effective maturity and average book yield: foreign currency risk. we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months . a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2015 , the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $9.8 million , and we would be required to pay approximately $9.8 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.8 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized losses of approximately $14.8 million and $11.1 million , net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 42 table of contents the following table

and $10.9 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value 43 table of contents if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. during fiscal 2015 and 2014 , we had no impairments to our investment portfolio. none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 44 table of contentsrisk factors 12 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the electronic design automation (eda) industry as a whole, and our eda and intellectual property (ip) product sales in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits, and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. furthermore, we depend on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue. reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, additional support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. 12 table of contents the continued uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. while the global economy has shown improvement, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions. weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years, causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs, including their research and development budgets, which capture spending on eda products and services. further uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. continuing caution by semiconductor companies could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored. in addition, should further economic instability affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations, it could adversely affect our financial results and our business. accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. if economic conditions deteriorate in the future, or, in particular, if the semiconductor industry does not grow, our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; 13 table of contents exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business; the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies; negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition-related costs; and requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business. if we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes to our effective tax rate; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which include a sole supplier for certain hardware components; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate, due to factors that include: cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue; delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method; delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development that customers have paid for early access to; customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; 14 table of contents the levels of our hardware revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements, and which may also impact our levels of excess and obsolete inventory expenses; and changes in our revenue recognition model. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it harder for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation. we also compete with other eda vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, as well as vendors of ip products and system-level solutions. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our ip products. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely impacted. as part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts. if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, 15 table of contents our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. additionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including software quality, testing, and security solutions. although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality, testing, and security products and services, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including the following: our ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience; our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements; our ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields, including, in the case of our software quality, testing, and security tools and services, identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages; our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries, many of which may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, or established customer relationships than we currently do; our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacencies with investment in our existing products; our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields; our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins; and our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services. difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third-parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. 16 table of contents changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles (us gaap) could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. the fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board (iasb) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow u.s. gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards (ifrs). in connection with this initiative, the fasb issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases. for information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to note 14 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading effect of new accounting pronouncements. these and other such standards may result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results. in addition, we may need to significantly change our customer and vendor contracts, accounting systems and processes. the cost and effect of these changes may adversely impact our results of operations. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. in addition, we have continually expanded our non-u.s. operations in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights; international economic and political conditions in countries where we do business, such as uncertainty caused by the united kingdom's referendum to withdraw from the european union; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries; additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy 17 table of contents and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. for example, in october 2015, we discovered unauthorized third-party access, which had begun in july 2015, to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system. we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed. no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system. while we identified and closed the method used to gain access, it is possible our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and such a breach could harm our business and reputation. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. our software products may also be vulnerable to cyberattacks. an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, and other destructive outcomes. as a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we are offering software quality and security testing solutions through our acquisition of companies such as coverity, codenomicon, cigital and codiscope. if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyberattack, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services, and could result in a loss of customers, sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our acquisitions in the software quality and security testing space may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company. 18 table of contents our operating results could be adversely affected by an increase in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes, changes in our geographical earnings mix, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns, or by material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. in addition, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. if our expectations regarding reinvestment of such earnings change, then our income tax expense could increase. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), which represents a coalition of member countries. on october 5, 2015, the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. in addition, the republic of ireland has changed its corporate residence rules and will require changes to our tax position by january 1, 2021. on july 26, 2016, hungary amended its ip regime to bring it in line with the oecd beps project and will be effective in fiscal 2017. changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. in the u.s., a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made. in october 2016, the hungarian tax authority (hta) completed an audit of our hungary subsidiary for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta proposed an aggregate tax assessment of $47 million, which we intend to contest. we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and certain state tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. in addition, a change in corporate tax rates could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2016 , approximately 85% of our worldwide cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance is held by our international subsidiaries. at present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, and to the extent they derive from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs primarily through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. as of october 31, 2016 , we had outstanding debt of $205.0 million under our $500.0 million revolving credit facility. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock. 19 table of contents from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. for example, we and emulation &amp; verification engineering s.a. (eve), a company we acquired in october 2012, are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation. the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately $36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement, and the court in the lawsuit has entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe. we have appealed from the injunction and the final judgment in the case. further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings and note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading legal proceedings. in addition, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding material pending lawsuits, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. our hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks. while sales of our hardware products have historically been immaterial to our total revenue, increased sales of our hardware products subject us to several increased risks, including: increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion; increasingly variable revenue and decreasingly accurate revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is recognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to sales of most software products for which revenue is recognized over time; overall reductions in margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products; longer sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which can adversely affect our operating results; 20 table of contents decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products; and longer warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty, thus increasing our costs. we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results. we license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. we also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. if we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation. the inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management's attention. some of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business. if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join us in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. if we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations, including "conflict minerals" regulations affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. 21 table of contents there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets. our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio currently consists of investment-grade u.s. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer's credit quality or changes in interest rates. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk . our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents short-term investments and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2016 , all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 43 table of contents the following table presents our cash equivalents, short-term investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates: as of october 31, 2016 maturing in year ending october 31, 2017 2018 2019 total fair value (in thousands) cash &amp; cash equivalent (variable rate) $ 790,049 $ $ $ 790,049 $ 790,049 average interest

years 37 total $ 140,695 actual maturities may differ from the stated maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. these investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or oci. the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period presented. foreign currency risk. we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months . a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2016 , the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $9.8 million , and we would be required to pay approximately $9.8 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based 44 table of contents expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.8 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized losses of approximately $19.9 million and $14.8 million , net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2016 : gross notional amount in u.s. dollars average contract rate (in thousands) forward contract values: japanese yen $ 250,763 107.895 euro 98,121 0.891 chinese renminbi 86,154

securities in privately held companies as of october 31, 2016 and 2015 , respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. during fiscal 2016 and 2015 , we had no impairments to our investment portfolio. none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 45 table of contentsrisk factors 12 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. 12 table of contents the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the electronic design automation (eda) industry as a whole, and our eda and intellectual property (ip) product sales in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits, and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. furthermore, we depend on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue. reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, additional support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. while the global economy has shown improvement in recent years, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions. uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. such caution by semiconductor companies could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts. we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate. further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations. there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to the complex law, and regulations governing our industry, the banking and financial services industry, and the economy could affect our business. in addition, economic conditions could deteriorate in the future, and, in particular, the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow. in the event of future improvements in 13 table of contents economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business; the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies; negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition-related costs; and requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business. if we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products especially products, such as hardware, generating upfront revenue due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; 14 table of contents our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes in tax rules, as well as changes to our effective tax rate, including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which include a sole supplier for certain hardware components; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate, due to factors that include: cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue, such as hardware; delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method; delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development that customers have paid for early access to; customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; the levels of our hardware revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements, and which may also impact our levels of excess and obsolete inventory expenses; and changes in our revenue recognition model. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it harder for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation (which was recently acquired by siemens ag). we also compete with other eda vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our ip products. in the area of ip products, we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers' internally developed ip. in the area of software integrity solutions, we compete with numerous other solution providers, many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis. we also compete with frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies and more established software companies. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and 15 table of contents potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. as part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts. if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. additionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including software quality, testing, and security solutions. although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality, testing, and security products and services, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including the following: our ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience; our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements; our ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields, including, in the case of our software quality, testing, and security tools and services, identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages; our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries, many of which may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, relevant intellectual property rights, or established customer relationships than we currently do; our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services; our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields; our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins; and our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services. 16 table of contents difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. for example, in october 2015, we discovered unauthorized third-party access, which had begun in july 2015, to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system. we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed. no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system. while we identified and closed the method used to gain access, it is possible our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and such a breach could harm our business and reputation. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. our software products may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks. an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, and other destructive outcomes. as a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we offer software security and quality testing solutions. if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyberattack, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services, and could result in a loss of customers, sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. in addition, we have continually expanded our non-u.s. operations in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights; uncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; 17 table of contents inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries; additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. as our business volume increases in the asia pacific region, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries and the united states, that governmental influences could result in trade disruptions. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. in addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third-parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. 18 table of contents we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue. our hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks. the growth of our hardware products subject us to several increased risks, including: increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion; increasingly variable revenue and decreasingly accurate revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is recognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time; overall reductions in margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products; longer sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which can adversely affect our operating results; decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products; and longer warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty, thus increasing our costs. changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) could adversely affect our reported financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. the fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board (iasb) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow u.s. gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards (ifrs). in connection with this initiative, the fasb issued new accounting standards for revenue recognition and accounting for leases. for information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to part ii, item 7, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-overview-effect of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. these and other such standards may result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in volatility of our financial results. in addition, we may need to significantly change our customer and vendor contracts, accounting systems and processes. the cost and effect of these changes may adversely impact our results of operations. 19 table of contents our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, or by evolving enforcement practices. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows. in addition, u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings of certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. if our intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings change, then our income tax expense could increase. in fiscal 2017, we repatriated $825 million of undistributed foreign earnings in anticipation of u.s. corporate tax reform. in the u.s., a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies. it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate or balance sheet at this time. proposed changes in corporate tax rates, the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the period in which tax reform is enacted, or could result in increases to our future u.s. tax expense. furthermore, proposed changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding reinvestment of such earnings . further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), which represents a coalition of member countries. on october 5, 2015, the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. in addition, the republic of ireland has changed its corporate residence rules and will require changes to our tax position by january 1, 2021. on july 26, 2016, hungary amended its ip regime to bring it in line with the oecd beps project and the changes were effective in fiscal 2017. changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform could increase uncertainty in the corporate tax area and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. our income and non-income tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made. in july 2017, the hungarian tax authority (hta) issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary (synopsys hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta has disallowed synopsys hungary's tax positions taken during these years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $47 million and interest and penalties of over $18 million (at current exchange rates). in addition, if the treatment of research expense were applied to fiscal years after 2014, synopsys hungary could lose approximately $18 million in tax benefit in tax periods subsequent to fiscal 2017 due to the enacted reduction of hungary's corporate income tax rate. if the assessment is ultimately canceled, the hungarian statutory accounting treatment could have an indirect adverse impact on certain tax benefits in the year of the cancellation. we are also under examination by the tax authorities in certain other jurisdictions. no material assessments have been proposed in these examinations. we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction. changes in our forecasts of 20 table of contents future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. in addition, a change in corporate tax rates could have a material impact on the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2017, approximately 47% of our worldwide cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance is held by our international subsidiaries. at present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad, and to the extent they derive from foreign earnings we have indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs primarily through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. as of october 31, 2017, we had outstanding debt of $144.0 million, net of an immaterial amount of debt issuance costs, under our $150.0 million term loan facility, and no outstanding debt under our $650.0 million revolving credit facility. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. for example, we and emulation &amp; verification engineering s.a. (eve), a company we acquired in october 2012, are party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation. the jury in one of the lawsuits returned a verdict of approximately $36 million in assessed damages against us for patent infringement, and the court in the lawsuit has entered an injunction prohibiting certain sales activities relating to the features found by the jury to infringe. we have appealed from the injunction and the final judgment in the case. further information regarding the eve lawsuits is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings and note 7 in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading legal proceedings. in addition, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, customer, supplier, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 21 table of contents we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results. we license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. we also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. if we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation. the inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management's attention. some of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business. if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join us in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. if we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations, including "conflict minerals" regulations affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues 22 table of contents and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets. from time to time, our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio consists of investment-grade u.s. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer's credit quality or changes in interest rates. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 46 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 46 table of contents interest rate risk . our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2017 , all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the following table presents our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates: as of october 31, 2017 maturing in year ending october 31, 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 total fair value (in thousands) cash &amp; cash equivalent (variable rate) $ 924,839 $ $ $ 924,839 $ 924,839 average interest rate 0.78 % % % term loan $ 10,313 $

prepay certain obligations. these investments are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), or oci. the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period presented. foreign currency risk. we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months . a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2017 , the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $10.4 million , and we would be required to pay approximately $10.4 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $10.4 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized gain of approximately $4.4 million and loss of $19.9 million , net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. 47 table of contents if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2017 : gross notional amount in u.s. dollars average contract rate (in thousands) forward contract values: japanese yen $

equity risk. we have approximately $7.8 million and $9.8 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31, 2017 and 2016 , respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. we recorded $1.3 million of other-than-temporary impairment during fiscal 2017 and did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2016 . none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 48 table of contentsrisk factors 13 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the electronic design automation (eda) industry as a whole, our eda and intellectual property (ip) product sales, and to some extent our software integrity solutions sales, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips and integrated circuits, and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. furthermore, we depend on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue. reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, additional support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. while the global economy has shown improvement in recent years, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery in many regions. uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. such caution by customers could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts. we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate. further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the 13 table of contents banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations. there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry, the banking and financial services industry, and the economy could affect our business. in addition, economic conditions could deteriorate in the future, and, in particular, the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow, including as the result of any disruption of international trade relationships. in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products especially products, such as hardware, generating upfront revenue due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; changes to the amount, composition and valuation of, and any impairments to or write-offs of, our inventory; changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes in tax rules, as well as changes to our effective tax rate, including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions and tax audit settlements; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components; general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries, such as disruptions to international trade relationships, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers' products; and changes in accounting standards, such as topic 606, as discussed in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements , which, for example, could impact the expected realization of our backlog. the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate. the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include: cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue, such as hardware; delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method; delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development as to which customers have paid for early access; 14 table of contents customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; the levels of our hardware revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements, and which may also impact our levels of excess and obsolete inventory expenses; changes in accounting standards, such as topic 606, as discussed in note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements ; and changes in our revenue recognition model. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete, and our business and financial condition may be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation (now part of siemens ag). we also compete with other eda vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our ip products. in the area of ip products, we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers' internally developed ip. in the area of software integrity solutions, we compete with numerous other solution providers, many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis. we also compete with frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies and more established software companies. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other differentiating rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. 15 table of contents the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. in addition, we have continually expanded our non-u.s. operations in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights; uncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries; additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. as our business volume increases in the asia pacific region, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries and the united states, that political, diplomatic, or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs, trade embargoes, and other trade barriers. a significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales; make our products more expensive for customers, which could make our products less competitive and reduce consumer demand; adversely restrict or delay our suppliers of hardware components and products, which could adversely impact our future revenues and financial results; or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits, our and our customers' and suppliers' businesses, and our results of operations. furthermore, if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in response to u.s. tariffs, other countries may adopt tariffs and other trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services. additionally, political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could have a negative impact on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely impact our business operations. in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. in addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. 16 table of contents exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. for example, in october 2015, we discovered unauthorized third-party access, which had begun in july 2015, to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system. we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed. no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system. while we identified and closed the method used to gain access, it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and such a breach could harm our business and reputation. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. our software products, including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions, may also be vulnerable to cyber attack. an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, and other destructive outcomes. as a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we offer software security and quality testing solutions. if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attack, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services, and could result in a loss of customers or sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third-parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; 17 table of contents protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business; the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies; negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition-related costs; and requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business. if we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. as part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts. if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. 18 table of contents additionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including software security and quality solutions. although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality, testing, and security products and services, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including the following: our ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience; our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements; our ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields, including, in the case of our software quality, testing, and security tools and services, identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages; our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries, many of which may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, relevant intellectual property rights, or established customer relationships than we currently do, and could include free and open source solutions that provide similar software quality, testing, and security tools without fees; our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services; our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields; our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins; and our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services. difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue. our hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks. the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks, including: increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion; increasingly variable revenue and decreasingly accurate revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is recognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time; overall reductions in margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products; longer sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which can adversely affect our operating results; decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products; and longer warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty, thus increasing our costs. 19 table of contents changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics, including, for example, revenue recognition and accounting for leases. for information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "effect of new accounting pronouncements." these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results. for example, the recent new revenue recognition standard will be applicable to us beginning in fiscal 2019 and could lead to increased volatility in our total revenue, as some of our revenue may be recognized in different periods and with less predictability than is the case under current accounting standards. our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, future changes to our tax structure, or by evolving enforcement practices. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows. on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), which significantly changed prior u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business in the current year and future years. accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may materially differ from previous estimates, and those differences may materially affect our financial position. in addition, the tax act includes certain new provisions that will affect our income from foreign operations beginning in fiscal 2019, as well as a lower corporate tax rate on income from domestic operations. because guidance continues to evolve, however, the net impact of these changes is uncertain, and while we believe such changes will have an overall favorable impact on our effective tax rate, certain interpretations of the international provisions of the tax act could adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years. in fiscal 2018, we incurred foreign taxes of $67.7 million as a result of reorganizing certain rights related to use of our intellectual property in our international business. such tax was recorded as a prepaid tax on our balance sheet, in accordance with current accounting rules. the amount of tax is subject to audit by the hungarian tax authority (hta) and could increase, along with the imposition of penalties and interest, and could materially affect our financial results and cash flow. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), which represents a coalition of member countries. on october 5, 2015, the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years. our income and non-income tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we are currently under examination by the tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is 20 table of contents uncertain. for example, we may be liable for additional withholding tax on payments made to us by customers in certain jurisdictions, and we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire, including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations, if any, under the tax act. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made. in july 2017, the hta issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary (synopsys hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta has disallowed synopsys hungary's tax positions taken during those years regarding the timing of the deduction of research expenses and applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $44.5 million and interest and penalties of $18.0 million. we paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. we continue to appeal the assessment through the hungarian administrative court. if the assessment is ultimately canceled, the hungarian statutory accounting treatment could have an indirect adverse impact on certain tax benefits in the year of the cancellation. for further discussion of the hungary audit, see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "non-us examinations." we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits, how such credits are treated under provisions of the tax act. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2018 , approximately 75% of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs, including the tax act provisional transition tax, primarily through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. for example, we were engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation (mentor) involving several actions in different forums. in june 2018, we settled all outstanding patent litigation with mentor for a $65.0 million payment made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to siemens, which previously acquired mentor in march 2017. further information regarding the lawsuits and settlement are contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings and note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading legal proceedings. in conjunction with the settlement, we also amended an existing interoperability agreement with mentor to collaborate on a wide range of eda products. the amendment includes a one-time termination charge between $0.0 and $25.0 million, payable to mentor under certain conditions. in the event such conditions are met, the termination charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results. 21 table of contents we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, customer, supplier, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors, including those resulting from third-party suppliers, could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results. we license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. we also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. if we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation. the inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management's attention. some of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business. 22 table of contents if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join us in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. if we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations, including "conflict minerals" regulations affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets. from time to time, our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio consists of investment-grade u.s. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer's credit quality or changes in interest rates. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. 23 table of contents we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 44 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk . our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2018 , all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 44

exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months . a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2018 , the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $12.4 million , and we would be required to pay approximately $12.4 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $12.4 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized loss of approximately $23.9 million and gain of $4.4 million , net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 45 table of contents the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as

equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. we did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2018 and recorded $1.3 million of other-than-temporary impairment during fiscal 2017. none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 46 table of contentsrisk factors 13 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the electronic design automation (eda) industry as a whole, our semiconductor &amp; system design segment product sales, and to some extent our software integrity segment product sales, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers, systems companies, and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips, integrated circuits, electronic systems and customers' concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry has matured, consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. furthermore, we depend on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue. reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, additional support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. we have also continually expanded our non-u.s. operations. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: 13 table of contents ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights; uncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business; government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. furthermore, if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. as our business volume increases in the asia pacific region, there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries and the united states, that political, diplomatic, or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs, trade embargoes, export restrictions and other trade barriers. a significant trade disruption, export restriction, or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services, make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers, increase the cost of our products and services, have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending, make our products less competitive, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits, our customers' and suppliers' businesses, and our results of operations. for example, beginning in may 2019, the united states government placed certain entities on the entity list, restricting the sale of u.s. technologies to the named entities. as a result of this government action, we are not able to book new business with these entities, and revenue associated with these entities is put on hold until either the contract expires, or the restriction is lifted. in response to that action or similar actions taken by the united states, other countries may adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services. current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions, which would have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, government or customer efforts, attitudes, laws, or policies regarding technology independence may lead to non-u.s. customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products, which would also have an adverse effect on our business. in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. in addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statements of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, including the renminbi or yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 14 table of contents uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. while the global economy has been relatively strong in recent years, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of economic recovery in many regions. uncertainty caused by challenging global economic conditions could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. such caution by customers could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts. we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate. further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations. there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry, the banking and financial services industry, and the economy could affect our business. in addition, economic conditions could deteriorate in the future, and, in particular, the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow, including as the result of any disruption of international trade relationships. in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products especially products, such as hardware, generating upfront revenue due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; changes to the amount, composition and valuation of, and any impairments to or write-offs of, our inventory; changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes in tax rules, as well as changes to our effective tax rate, including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions and tax audit settlements; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components; natural variability in the timing of ip drawdowns, which can be difficult to predict; general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries, such as disruptions to international trade relationships, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers' products; and changes in accounting standards, which may impact the way we recognize our revenue and costs and impact our earnings. 15 table of contents the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate. the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include: cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue, such as hardware; delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method; delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development as to which customers have paid for early access; customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; the levels of our hardware and ip revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements; and changes in our revenue recognition model. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete, and our business and financial condition may be harmed. in our semiconductor &amp; system design segment, we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation (now part of siemens ag). we also compete with other eda vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our ip products. in the area of ip products, we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers' internally developed ip. in our software integrity segment, we compete with numerous other solution providers, many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis. we also compete with frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies and more established software companies. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing software and hardware products, and successfully develop or acquire such new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other differentiating rights, such as 16 table of contents multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. for example, we discovered unauthorized third-party access to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system in 2015. we determined that no customer project or design data had been accessed. no personally identifiable information or payment card information is stored on the system. while we identified and closed the method used to gain access, it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and such a breach could harm our business and reputation. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. our software products, including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions, may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks. an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, and other destructive outcomes. as a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we offer software security and quality testing solutions. if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services, and could result in a loss of customers or sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company. 17 table of contents if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third-parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; difficulties in negotiating, governing and realizing value from strategic investments; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business; the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies; 18 table of contents negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition or investment-related costs; and requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business. if we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. as part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts. if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. additionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including software security and quality testing solutions. although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including the following: our ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience; our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements; our ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields, including, in the case of our software quality testing and security tools and services, identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages; our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries, many of which may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, relevant intellectual property rights, or established customer relationships than we currently do, and could include free and open source solutions that provide similar software quality testing and security tools without fees; our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services; our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields; our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins; and our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services. difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. 19 table of contents software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors, including those resulting from third-party suppliers, could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. our hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks. the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks, including: increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion; increasingly variable revenue and decreasingly accurate revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is recognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time; potential reductions in overall margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products; longer sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which can adversely affect our operating results; decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products; and longer warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty, thus increasing our costs. changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics, including, for example, revenue recognition and accounting for leases. for information regarding new accounting standards, please refer to note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "effect of new accounting pronouncements." these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results. for example, the new revenue recognition standard became applicable to us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and there is an increased volatility in our total revenue with less predictability than the prior accounting standard. our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, future changes to our tax structure, or by evolving enforcement practices. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions, with a significant amount of our foreign earnings generated by our subsidiaries organized in ireland and hungary. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows. 20 table of contents on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), which significantly changed prior u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. the tax act includes certain new provisions that began to affect our income from foreign operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. the applicability and impact of these new tax provisions is dependent in part on changes to our tax structure that were implemented in response to the tax act at the end of fiscal 2018. the net impact of such changes is uncertain, and could adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years. since the beginning of fiscal 2019, the u.s. treasury department has issued proposed regulations that, if finalized as written, would have a material impact on our ability to claim certain tax benefits related to the tax act. while the company continues to evaluate the potential impact on its estimated annual tax rate, certain of these regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. as additional regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may materially differ from previous estimates, and those differences may materially affect our financial position. accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment. as regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may materially differ from previous estimates, and those differences may materially affect our financial position. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (beps) project undertaken by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), which represents a coalition of member countries. on october 5, 2015, the oecd issued a series of reports recommending changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. many of these recommendations are being adopted by various countries in which we do business and may increase our taxes in these countries. changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years. our income and non-income tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire, including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations, if any, under the tax act. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made. in july 2017, the hungarian tax authority (hta) issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary (synopsys hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. we paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. on april 30, 2019, the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary. we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5, 2019. for further discussion of the hungary audit, see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading "non-u.s. examinations." we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits, how such credits are treated under provisions of the tax act. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2019 , approximately 74% of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs, including the tax act provisional transition tax, primarily through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock. 21 table of contents from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. for example, we were engaged in complex patent litigation with mentor graphics corporation (mentor) involving several actions in different forums. in june 2018, we settled all outstanding patent litigation with mentor for a $65.0 million payment made in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 to siemens, which acquired mentor in march 2017. further information regarding the lawsuits and settlement are contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings and note 7 of notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading legal proceedings. in conjunction with the settlement, we also amended an existing interoperability agreement with mentor to collaborate on a wide range of eda products. the amendment includes a one-time termination charge between $0.0 and $25.0 million, payable to mentor under certain conditions. in the event such conditions are met, the termination charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, customer, supplier, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results. we license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. we also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. if we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation. the inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management's attention. some of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business. 22 table of contents if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join us in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. if we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations, including "conflict minerals" regulations affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets. from time to time, our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio consists of investment-grade u.s. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer's credit quality or changes in interest rates. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. 23 table of contents we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk . our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2019 , all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable and fixed interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 43 table of contents our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of october 31, 2019 are as follows: maturing in year ending october 31, 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 total fair value (in thousands) cash &amp; cash equivalent (variable rate) $ 598,027 $ 598,027 $ 598,027 approx. average interest rate 1.03 % short-term debt

17,905 average interest rate chinese central bank rate + 10% of such rate foreign currency risk. we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months . see note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts . the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2019 , the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $10.4 million , and we would be required to pay approximately $10.4 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $10.4 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized loss of approximately $4.5 million and $23.9 million , net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 44 table of contents information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2019 was as follows: gross notional amount in u.s. dollars average contract rate (in thousands) forward contract values: japanese yen $ 266,383 106.829 indian rupee 118,635 74.243 euro 104,142 1.148 hungarian forint 88,164

held companies as of october 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. we did not recognize any impairment during fiscal 2019 and 2018. none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 45 table of contentsrisk factors 15 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. covid-19 pandemic risks the covid-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. the covid-19 pandemic has caused minor disruptions to our business operations to date and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition in the future. for example, we experienced limited hardware supply chain and logistical challenges as well as a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment. in response to the covid-19 novel coronavirus pandemic, governments and businesses have taken unprecedented actions to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders and restrictions on non-essential businesses. these restrictions have significantly curtailed global economic activity and have caused substantial volatility and disruption in global financial markets. we transitioned most of our employees in affected regions to work remotely in order to comply with applicable restrictions and government requirements , and implemented travel restrictions and other changes to our business operations. we are transitioning employees back into offices in select jurisdictions in conformity with local guidelines and regulations. each office must follow physical distancing guidelines and affirmative health measures in compliance with different local and national requirements. although we have been able to navigate workplace restrictions and limitations with minimal disruptions to our business operations to date, we may further modify our business practices and real estate needs in response to the risks and negative impacts caused by the covid-19 pandemic. we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful. the extent to which the covid-19 pandemic impacts our business operations in future periods will depend on multiple uncertain factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, its overall negative impact on the global economy, continued responses by governments and businesses to covid-19, the ability to secure timely payment from customers, the ability to accurately estimate customer demand, reduced willingness of current and potential customers to purchase our products and services due to their own business and market uncertainties, the ability of our business partners and third-party providers to fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, the ability to secure adequate and timely supply of equipment and materials from suppliers for our hardware products , and the ability to develop and deliver our products. in addition, continued weak economic conditions may result in impairment in value of our tangible and intangible assets. the impact of the covid-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this risk factors section. industry risks the growth of our business depends primarily on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the electronic design automation (eda) industry as a whole, our semiconductor &amp; system design segment product sales, and to some extent our software integrity segment product sales, are dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers, systems companies, and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of systems-on-chips, integrated circuits, electronic systems and customers' concerns about managing costs have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls, including due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. additionally, as the eda industry has matured, consolidation has resulted in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and 15 table of contents manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries' manufacturing processes or major ip providers' products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. consolidation among our customers and within the industries in which we operate, as well as our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred over the last several years, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. furthermore, we depend on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue. reduced customer spending or the loss of a small number of customers, particularly our large customers, could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, additional support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. uncertainty caused by the recent challenging global economic conditions, including due to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic, could lead some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. such caution by customers could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts. outside of a slowdown in customer commitments in our software integrity segment, we have not seen evidence of impacts on customer orders from the covid-19 pandemic to date. we cannot predict the stability of the economy as a whole or the industries in which we operate. further economic instability could adversely affect the banking and financial services industry and result in credit downgrades of the banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions, and deposit services, or cause them to default on their obligations. there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to the complex laws and regulations governing our industry, the banking and financial services industry, and the economy could affect our business. in addition, economic conditions could deteriorate in the future, and, in particular, the semiconductor and electronics industries could fail to grow, including as the result of the effects of the covid-19 pandemic and any disruption of international trade relationships such as tariffs, export licenses, or other government trade restrictions. in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. any of the foregoing could cause adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers' demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our products may become uncompetitive and obsolete, and our business and financial condition may be harmed. in our semiconductor &amp; system design segment, we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation (now part of siemens ag). we also compete with other eda vendors, including new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products, including internal designs that compete with our ip products. in the area of ip products, we compete against numerous other ip providers as well as our customers' internally developed ip. 16 table of contents in our software integrity segment, we compete with numerous other solution providers, many of which focus on specific aspects of software security or quality analysis. we also compete with frequent new entrants, which include start-up companies and more established software companies. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers' products, design starts and our customers' budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements as well as changes in industry standards and customer requirements. for example, the adoption of cloud computing and artificial intelligence technologies can bring new demands and also challenges in terms of disruption to both business models and our existing technology offerings. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing software and hardware products, and successfully develop or acquire such new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other differentiating rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; our ability to manage an efficient supply chain to ensure availability of hardware products; our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms; and our ability to provide engineering and design consulting for our products. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. business operations risks the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive roughly half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. we have also continually expanded our non-u.s. operations. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: ineffective or weaker legal protection of intellectual property rights; uncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business; government trade restrictions, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers, and changes to existing trade arrangements between various countries such as china; 17 table of contents difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business, which may include business practices in which we are prohibited from engaging by the foreign corrupt practices act or other anti-corruption laws; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war, and infectious diseases and pandemics, including covid-19. furthermore, if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. there is inherent risk, based on the complex relationships between certain asian countries such as china and the united states, that political, diplomatic, or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs, trade embargoes, export restrictions and other trade barriers. a significant trade disruption, export restriction, or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could reduce customer demand and cause customers to search for substitute products and services, make our products and services more expensive or unavailable for customers, increase the cost of our products and services, have a negative impact on customer confidence and spending, make our products less competitive, or otherwise have a materially adverse impact on our future revenue and profits, our customers' and suppliers' businesses, and our results of operations. for example, beginning in may 2019, the united states government placed certain entities on the entity list, restricting the sale of u.s. technologies to the named entities. as a result of this government action, unless and until the restriction is lifted, we are not able to ship products or provide support to these entities. in addition, in may 2020, the united states government placed further restrictions on certain entities on the entity list to prevent them from sharing designs developed using u.s. software or technology with other entities on the entity list and obtaining semiconductors manufactured with processes that use u.s. software and technology. in august 2020, the entity list rules were further revised such that any company with knowledge that a customer will use certain u.s. technologies to design or produce any item for a huawei-affiliated company on the entity list must obtain a license prior to any export of such technologies. we believe that this latest restriction will not materially impact our business at this time, but cannot predict the impact that additional regulatory changes may have on our business in the future. in response to these actions or similar actions taken by the united states, other countries may adopt tariffs and trade barriers that could limit our ability to offer our products and services. current and potential customers who are concerned or affected by such tariffs or restrictions may respond by developing their own products or replacing our solutions, which would have an adverse effect on our business. in addition, government or customer efforts, attitudes, laws, or policies regarding technology independence may lead to non-u.s. customers favoring their domestic technology solutions that could compete with or replace our products, which would also have an adverse effect on our business. in addition to tariffs and other trade barriers, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. in addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. we may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. if we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. 18 table of contents our financial results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statements of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, including the renminbi or yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products-especially products, such as hardware, generating upfront revenue-due to fluctuations in demand for our customers' products and due to constraints in our customers' budgets for research and development and eda products and services; changes in demand for our products due to customers reducing their expenditures, whether as a cost-cutting measure or a result of their insolvency or bankruptcy, and whether due to the covid-19 pandemic or other reasons; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; changes to the amount, composition and valuation of, and any impairments to or write-offs of, our inventory; changes in the mix of our products sold, as increased sales of our products with lower gross margins, such as our hardware products, may reduce our overall margins; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes in tax rules, as well as changes to our effective tax rate, including the tax effects of infrequent or unusual transactions and tax audit settlements; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products, which includes a sole supplier for certain hardware components; natural variability in the timing of ip drawdowns, which can be difficult to predict; general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries, such as disruptions to international trade relationships, including tariffs, export licenses, or other trade barriers affecting our or our suppliers' products, as well as impacts due to the covid-19 pandemic; and changes in accounting standards, which may impact the way we recognize our revenue and costs and impact our earnings. 19 table of contents the timing of revenue recognition may also cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate. the timing of revenue recognition is affected by factors that include: cancellations or changes in levels of orders or the mix between upfront products revenue and time-based products revenue; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront products revenue, such as hardware; delay in the completion of professional services projects that require significant modification or customization and are accounted for using the percentage of completion method; delay in the completion and delivery of ip products in development as to which customers have paid for early access; customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; and the levels of our hardware and ip revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. additionally, our results may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, or such analysts may change their recommendation regarding our stock, which could cause our stock price to decline. our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares at a time or a price that is favorable to them. cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation, particularly that of our security testing solutions. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. as a result of the covid-19 pandemic and shelter-in-place orders, most of our employees in affected areas are working remotely, which magnifies the importance of the integrity of our remote access security measures. for example, we discovered unauthorized third-party access to our products and product license files hosted on our solvnet customer license and product delivery system in 2015. while we identified and remediated the incident, it is possible that our security measures may be circumvented again in the future, and any such breach could harm our business and reputation. the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. while our standard vendor terms and conditions include provisions requiring the use of appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our data, as well as other safeguards, a breach may still occur. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor's systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. our software products, including our hosted solutions as well as our software security and quality testing solutions, may also be vulnerable to cyber attacks. an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software, cause errors in the output of our customers' work, allow unauthorized access to our or our customers' proprietary information, or cause other destructive outcomes. as a result, our reputation could suffer, customers could stop buying our products, we could face lawsuits and potential liability, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted. we offer software security and quality testing solutions. if we fail to identify new and increasingly sophisticated methods of cyber attacks, or fail to invest sufficient resources in research and development regarding new threat vectors, our security testing products and services may fail to detect vulnerabilities in our customers' software code. 20 table of contents an actual or perceived failure to identify security flaws may harm the perceived reliability of our security testing products and services, and could result in a loss of customers or sales, or an increased cost to remedy a problem. furthermore, our growth and recent acquisitions in the software security and quality testing space may increase our visibility as a security-focused company and may make us a more attractive target for attacks on our own information technology infrastructure. successful attacks could damage our reputation as a security-focused company. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and other third-parties as well as intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue if their efforts are successful. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. from time to time, we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions and strategic investments are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions and strategic investments in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition or investment targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions or investments due to unfavorable credit markets, commercially unacceptable terms, or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions and strategic investments are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new markets in which we are not experienced or where competitors may have stronger positions; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; 21 table of contents difficulties in integrating or expanding sales, marketing and distribution functions and administrative systems, including information technology and human resources systems; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; difficulties in negotiating, governing and realizing value from strategic investments; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management's attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impacts on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; exposure to new operational risks, regulations, and business customs to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where we are not currently conducting business; the need to implement controls, processes and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that may have lacked such controls, processes and policies; negative impact on our net income resulting from acquisition or investment-related costs; and requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of an acquisition, including required divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business. if we do not manage the foregoing risks, the acquisitions or strategic investments that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we pursue new product and technology initiatives from time to time, and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted. as part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts. if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. additionally, from time to time, we invest in expansion into adjacent markets, including software security and quality testing solutions. although we believe these solutions are complementary to our eda tools, we have less experience and a more limited operating history in offering software quality testing and security products and services, and our efforts in this area may not be successful. our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors, including the following: our ability to attract a new customer base, including in industries in which we have less experience; our successful development of new sales and marketing strategies to meet customer requirements; our ability to accurately predict, prepare for, and promptly respond to technological developments in new fields, including, in the case of our software quality testing and security tools and services, identifying new security vulnerabilities in software code and ensuring support for a growing number of programming languages; our ability to compete with new and existing competitors in these new industries, many of which may have more financial resources, industry experience, brand recognition, relevant intellectual property rights, or established customer relationships than we currently do, and could include free and open source solutions that provide similar software quality testing and security tools without fees; 22 table of contents our ability to skillfully balance our investment in adjacent markets with investment in our existing products and services; our ability to attract and retain employees with expertise in new fields; our ability to sell and support consulting services at profitable margins; and our ability to manage our revenue model in connection with hybrid sales of licensed products and consulting services. difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets, including delays or disruptions as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create additional revenue. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released, or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors, including those resulting from third-party suppliers, could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, any allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. our hardware products, which primarily consist of prototyping and emulation systems, subject us to distinct risks. the growth in sales of our hardware products subjects us to several risks, including: increased dependence on a sole supplier for certain hardware components, which may reduce our control over product quality and pricing and may lead to delays in production and delivery of our hardware products, should our supplier fail to deliver sufficient quantities of acceptable components in a timely fashion; increasingly variable revenue and less predictable revenue forecasts, due to fluctuations in hardware revenue, which is recognized upfront upon shipment, as opposed to most sales of software products for which revenue is recognized over time; potential reductions in overall margins, as the gross margin for our hardware products is typically lower than those of our software products; longer sales cycles, which create risks of insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory valuation, which can adversely affect our operating results; decreases or delays in customer purchases in favor of next-generation releases, which may lead to excess or obsolete inventory or require us to discount our older hardware products; 23 table of contents longer warranty periods than those of our software products, which may require us to replace hardware components under warranty, thus increasing our costs; and potential impacts on our supply chain due to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2020 , approximately 52% of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries. we intend to meet our u.s. cash spending needs primarily through our existing u.s. cash balances, ongoing u.s. cash flows, and available credit under our term loan and revolving credit facilities. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed these liquidity sources, due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic or otherwise, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure or the market price of our common stock. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. we may not be able to continue to obtain licenses to third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, which may disrupt our business and harm our financial results. we license third-party software and other intellectual property for use in product research and development and, in several instances, for inclusion in our products. we also license third-party software, including the software of our competitors, to test the interoperability of our products with other industry products and in connection with our professional services. these licenses may need to be renegotiated or renewed from time to time, or we may need to obtain new licenses in the future. third parties may stop adequately supporting or maintaining their technology, or they or their technology may be acquired by our competitors. if we are unable to obtain licenses to these third-party software and intellectual property on reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to sell the affected products, our customers' use of the products may be interrupted, or our product development processes and professional services offerings may be disrupted, which could in turn harm our financial results, our customers, and our reputation. the inclusion of third-party intellectual property in our products can also subject us and our customers to infringement claims. although we seek to mitigate this risk contractually, we may not be able to sufficiently limit our potential liability. regardless of outcome, infringement claims may require us to use significant resources and may divert management's attention. some of our products and technology, including those we acquire, may include software licensed under open source licenses. some open source licenses could require us, under certain circumstances, to make available or grant licenses to any modifications or derivative works we create based on the open source software. although we have tools and processes to monitor and restrict our use of open source software, the risks associated with open source usage may not be eliminated and may, if not properly addressed, result in unanticipated obligations that harm our business. if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join us in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, 24 table of contents sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our recruiting and retention efforts may be negatively impacted by restrictions on travel and business activity due to the covid-19 pandemic. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue equity awards from employee equity plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. if we are unable to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, it could limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. in addition, we cannot predict the full impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business operations. the uncertainty affects management's estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions. legal and regulatory risks changes in united states generally accepted accounting principles (u.s. gaap) could adversely affect our financial results and may require significant changes to our internal accounting systems and processes. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board (fasb), the securities and exchange commission (sec) and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. the fasb periodically issues new accounting standards on a variety of topics, including, for example, revenue recognition and accounting for leases. these and other such standards generally result in different accounting principles, which may significantly impact our reported results or could result in variability of our financial results. for example, the new revenue recognition standard became applicable to us at the beginning of fiscal 2019 and there is an increased volatility in our total revenue with less predictability than the prior accounting standard. our results could be adversely affected by a change in our effective tax rate as a result of tax law changes and related new or revised guidance and regulations, changes in our geographical earnings mix, unfavorable government reviews of our tax returns, material differences between our forecasted and actual annual effective tax rates, future changes to our tax structure, or by evolving enforcement practices. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. because we have a wide range of statutory tax rates in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, any changes in our geographical earnings mix, including those resulting from our intercompany transfer pricing or from changes in the rules governing transfer pricing, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, a change in the tax law of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates, an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense or limitations on our ability to utilize tax credits, could result in a material increase in our tax expense and impact our financial position and cash flows. for example, in response to the fiscal impact of the covid-19 pandemic, the state of california enacted legislation on june 29, 2020 that would suspend the use of certain corporate research and development tax credits for a three-year period beginning in our fiscal 2021, which could result in an impact in our tax expense. on december 22, 2017, the president of the united states signed into law the tax cuts and jobs act (tax act), which significantly changed prior u.s. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. the tax act includes certain new provisions that began to affect our income from foreign operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. since the beginning of fiscal 2019, the u.s. treasury department has issued proposed regulations that 25 table of contents could have a material impact on our ability to claim certain tax benefits related to the tax act. while we continue to evaluate the potential impact on our estimated annual tax rate, certain of these regulations have not been finalized and are subject to change. as additional regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may materially differ from previous estimates, and those differences may materially affect our financial position. accounting for certain of these provisions requires the exercise of significant judgment. further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the programme of work to develop a concensus solution to the tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy (programme of work) agreement by the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd), which represents a coalition of member countries, including the united states. the programme of work is evaluating potential changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. these changes, if enacted, by various countries in which we do business may increase our taxes in these countries. changes to these and other areas in relation to international tax reform, including future actions taken by foreign governments in response to the tax act, could increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years. our income and non-income tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise significant judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we may also be liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire, including future taxes payable related to the transition tax on earnings from their foreign operations, if any, under the tax act. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination in an audit may be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes because of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the periods for which that determination is made. in july 2017, the hungarian tax authority (hta) issued a final assessment against our hungarian subsidiary (synopsys hungary) for fiscal years 2011 through 2013. the hta has applied withholding taxes on certain payments made to affiliates, resulting in an aggregate tax assessment of approximately $25.0 million and interest and penalties of $11.0 million. we paid the tax assessments, penalties and interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as required by law and recorded these amounts as prepaid taxes on our balance sheet. on april 30, 2019, the hungarian administrative court ruled against synopsys hungary. we filed an appeal with the hungarian supreme court on july 5, 2019. the hungarian supreme court heard our appeal on november 12, 2020 and issued a ruling from the bench to remand the case to the hungarian administrative court for further proceedings. we expect to receive the hungarian supreme court's written decision in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. for further discussion of the hungary audit, see note 13 of notes to consolidated financial statements. we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to certain tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income in the relevant jurisdiction and in the case of foreign tax credits, how such credits are treated under provisions of the tax act. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, customer, supplier, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding certain of these matters is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other regulations, including conflict minerals regulations 26 table of contents affecting our hardware products, have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by any deterioration of capital markets. from time to time, our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio consists of investment-grade u.s. government agency securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, money market funds, municipal securities and other securities, and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk and may be negatively impacted by the economic effects of the covid-19 pandemic. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer's credit quality or changes in interest rates. general risks catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, epidemic or pandemic (including the covid-19 pandemic), or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. in particular, our sales and infrastructure are vulnerable to regional or worldwide health conditions, including the effects of the outbreak of contagious diseases such as the covid-19 pandemic. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk . our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2020 , all of our cash, cash equivalents, and debt were at short-term variable or fixed interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 47 table of contents our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of october 31, 2020 are as follows: maturing in year ending october 31, 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafter total fair value (in thousands) cash &amp; cash equivalents $ 1,097,122 $ 1,097,122 $ 1,097,122 approx. average interest rate 0.13 %

0.74% of such rate foreign currency risk. we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 22 months . see note 2 and note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts . the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2020 , the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $7.6 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $7.6 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in positive cash flow of approximately $7.6 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized gain of approximately $3.4 million and net unrealized loss of $4.5 million , net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 48 table of contents information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2020 was as follows: gross notional amount in u.s. dollars average contract rate

respectively. the investments that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted using the measurement alternative when the fair value of the investment is not readily determinable. securities accounted for as equity method investments are recorded at cost plus the proportional share of the issuers' income or loss, which is recorded in the other income (expense), net. investments are written down to the fair value when an event or circumstance which impacts the fair value of these investments indicates that the investments are impaired and the fair value of the investments is less than the carrying value. none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 49 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors conditions of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance and unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results and is incorporated by reference here. synopsys' aggregate backlog was approximately $2.5 billion on october 31, 2007, representing a 25% increase from backlog of $2.0 billion on october 31, 2006. this increase is primarily due to an increase in the weighted average length of our contracts caused by the extended length of a large customer agreement, as well as an increase in the number and size of orders received during fiscal 2007. aggregate backlog includes deferred revenue, operational backlog and financial backlog. deferred revenue represents that portion of orders for software products, license maintenance and other services which have been delivered and billed to the customer but on which the revenue has not yet been recognized. operational backlog consists of orders for software products and maintenance that have not been shipped and orders for consulting services that have not yet been performed and accepted. financial backlog consists of future installments not yet due and payable under existing time-based licenses and maintenance contracts. backlog, particularly longer-term backlog, may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions change and technologies evolve, and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements. for this and other reasons, we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when expected. we have not historically experienced material order cancellations. the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our five common groupings, or platforms, established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years. we include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. for presentation purposes, we allocate maintenance revenue, which represented approximately 6%, 9% and 14% of our total 7 revenue in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, to the products to which those support services related. fy 2007 fy 2006 fy 2005 galaxy design platform 49 % 52 % 56 % discovery verification platform 26 % 24 % 22 % core eda 75 % 76 % 78 % intellectual property 8 % 8 % 7 % design for manufacturing

11% and 13% of our total revenue for the fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. research and development our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further integrate our design and verification platforms and to expand our design for manufacturing and ip product offerings. research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. in addition, an advanced technology group within synopsys' silicon engineering group explores new technologies and maintains strong research relationships outside synopsys with both industry and academia. during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, research and development expenses, excluding capitalized software development costs, were $379.2 million, $370.6 million and $320.9 million, respectively. synopsys' capitalized software development costs were approximately $2.3 million, $3.5 million, and $3.0 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. competition the eda industry is highly competitive. we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers' own design tools and internal design capabilities. in general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms. our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation, and companies that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, such as magma design automation, inc. in recent years, we have increasingly competed on the basis of payment terms and price. in some situations, in order to win business we must offer substantial discounts on our products due to competitive factors. in other situations, we may lose potential business to a competitor offering a lower price. product sales and licensing agreements we typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network, including, in some cases, regional or global networks. license fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed. in many cases, we provide our customers the right to "re-mix" a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products. for example, a customer may use our front-end 8 design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end placement software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer's ic design. this practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. the customer's re-mix of product, when so provided under the customer agreement, does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer, which is governed by our revenue recognition policies. the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor. at the same time, because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without re-mix rights. we currently offer our software products under various license types: renewable tsls, term licenses and perpetual licenses. for a full discussion of these licenses, see part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations revenue background . with respect to our designware core intellectual property products, we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications. fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties. finally, our global technical services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project. proprietary rights synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. however, third parties may develop similar technology independently. in addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future. in many cases, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights. as a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. for example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it. employees as of october 31, 2007, synopsys had 5,196 employees, with 2,781 based in north america and 2,415 based outside of north america. acquisitions in fiscal 2007 for information about acquisitions we completed during fiscal 2007, please see part ii, item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements which information is incorporated by reference here. 9 item 1a. risk factors weakness, budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our business. in recent years, we believe that eda industry growth has been adversely affected by many factors, including ongoing efforts by semiconductor companies to control their spending, uncertainty regarding the long-term growth rate of the semiconductor industry, excess eda tool capacity of some of our customers and increased competition in the eda industry itself causing pricing pressure on eda vendors. if these factors persist or additional semiconductor industry growth does not occur (or if we do not benefit from any such increases), our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. we also believe that, over the long term, growth in eda spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor r&amp;d spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market. however, we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues, r&amp;d spending or spending on eda products, nor whether we will benefit from any of these increases should they occur. competition in the eda industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. we compete with other eda vendors that offer a broad range of products and services, primarily cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation and with other eda vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, such as magma design automation, inc. we also compete with customers' internally developed design tools and capabilities. if we fail to compete effectively, our business will be materially and adversely affected. we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms. additional competitive challenges include the following: price continues to be a competitive factor . we believe that some eda vendors are increasingly offering discounts, which could be significant. if we are unable to match a competitor's pricing for a particular solution, we may lose business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other eda purchases with the competitor. technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly . accordingly, we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. if we fail to do so, our business will be materially and adversely affected. to compete effectively, we believe we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance. we have invested significant resources into further development of our galaxy design platform, integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of its systemverilog and other advanced features and development of our design for manufacturing and ip portfolios. we can provide no assurance that our customers will find these tool and ip configurations more attractive than our competitors' offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance will be successful. payment terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated by our customers . payment terms on time-based licenses have generally lengthened over time. longer payment terms could continue in the future, which would negatively affect our future operating cash flow. 10 potential consolidation of competitors. if any of our competitors consolidate, they may be able to exert additional market power and/or offer lower pricing, either of which would make it more difficult to compete successfully. lack of growth in new ic design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the eda industry, including demand for our products and services. the increasing complexities of socs and ics, and customers' concerns about managing cost and risk have also led to the following potentially long-term negative trends: the number of ic design starts has remained flat during the last three years. new ic design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for eda software. a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely. mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services, and in some cases, increase customers' bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including synopsys. due to factors such as increased globalization, cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent, adversely impacting our customers' eda spending. industry changes, plus the cost and complexity of ic design, may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design, or using field programmable gate arrays (fpgas), an alternative chip technology. all of these trends, if sustained, could have a material adverse effect on the eda industry, including the demand for our products and services, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our prior financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. a change in these principles, or in our interpretations of these principles, can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. for example, in september 2006, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements (sab 108). sab 108 addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. in the year of adoption, sab 108 allows a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment for errors that were not previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance in sab 108. we adopted the provisions of sab 108 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and as a result recognized a one-time adjustment of approximately $14.9 million to retained earnings. in june 2006, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109 (fin 48). fin 48 addresses recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. fin 48 will be effective for synopsys beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. upon adoption of fin 48, we are required to make an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the impact of adoption as well as adjust certain balance sheet amounts to conform with the new standard. while we are in the process of completing our review of fin 48, we do not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on our retained earnings or our results of operations for fiscal year 2008. however, certain reclassifications to our assets and liabilities may be required. 11 we have received a revenue agent's report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our u.s. taxable income. an adverse outcome could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. on june 8, 2005, we received a revenue agent's report ("rar") in which the internal revenue service ("irs") proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that we thus have meritorious defenses to this proposed irs adjustment. on july 13, 2005, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs, which caused the matter to be referred to the appeals division of the irs. in december 2007, we reached a tentative settlement with the appeals division that would resolve this dispute. the settlement is subject to further review and approval within the government, which we expect will take several more months, but we believe that settlement is likely. if the settlement becomes final on the tentative terms agreed upon, then we have already adequately provided for this matter. final resolution of this matter could take considerable time or may not be finally approved by the government, in which case, while we believe we are still adequately provided for regarding this matter, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2006, the irs started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years 2002 through 2004. as of october 31, 2007, the examination is still in progress and no adjustments have been proposed by the irs which would require an adjustment to the tax provision. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit, there could be a material adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we have large operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions and expiration of foreign tax rulings could materially increase our effective tax rate. furthermore, we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states. changes in our forecasts of such future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results. our revenue and earnings fluctuate, which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline. many factors affect our revenue and earnings, including customer demand, license mix, the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold and committed expense levels, making it difficult 12 to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period. accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance. from time to time, we provide guidance related to our future financial performance. in addition, financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance. because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate, future financial performance is difficult to predict. downward adjustments of our guidance or the failure to meet our guidance or the expectations of research analysts would cause the market price of our common stock to decline. some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include, but are not limited to: we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized. since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income. our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time-based licenses. the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders, customer demand, customer payment terms and ship dates could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. for example, if we ship more upfront licenses than expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target; conversely, if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected, our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target. similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of time-based license orders during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected. we may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externally-communicated financial targets, any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could adversely affect our business. the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers' products, customer r&amp;d and eda tool budgets, pricing, our competitors' product offerings and customer design starts. it is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customers' demand for our products on a medium or long term basis. as a result, actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which, in turn, could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly- disclosed targets. we often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products. although these amendments can provide a longer-term payment stream from the customers, they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger. certain of our upfront and time-based license agreements provide customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products. while this practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately. in the past, we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. the delay of one or more orders, particularly an upfront order, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and/or earnings for that quarter. 13 we rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenue and the loss of one of such customers could have an adverse effect on our subsequent revenue and/or earnings; we make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition, specifically determining the existence of proper documentation, establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable, verifying delivery of our software and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers. while we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future. in such an event, we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods, which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods. our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision. accordingly, our customers' evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles. the failure to meet the semiconductor industry's demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may adversely affect our financial results. soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing. to address greater complexity, semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers. at the same time, as a general business trend, we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. failure to manage these conflicting demands successfully would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. customer payment defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our backlog consists principally of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. these customer obligations are typically not cancelable, but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed. in these cases, we will generally take legal action to recover amounts owed. moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses. though we have not, to date, experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project. we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future. in addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; 14 regulatory delays; drain on management time for acquisition-related activities; assumption of unknown liabilities; and adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships. while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will positively affect our future performance. furthermore, if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the product or technology; any such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. conditions of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance. during fiscal 2007 and 2006, we derived 50% and 49% of our revenue from outside the united states; going forward, we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from customers outside the united states. foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the effects of international political conflict, hostilities and natural disasters. further, any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states. our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our results of operations can be adversely affected when the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen and the canadian dollar, as a result of the conversion of revenue and expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. while we hedge some foreign currency exposures of our business, we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures, and there can be no assurance our hedging activities will completely mitigate our foreign currency risks. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions locally and higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states. the failure to effectively manage our global operations would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe on a third party's intellectual property rights. as a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. for example, in march 2007, we settled a matter with magma design, inc. in which both parties claimed patent infringement. as part of the settlement, magma paid us an aggregate of $12.5 million. we are also currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it. 15 these types of claims can, however, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. a failure to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. to protect this technology, we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide. we can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. moreover, some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property; our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. we have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies. for example, we are pursuing anti-piracy cases against certain companies located in china. however, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation may reduce our net income. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the sec, nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board. many of these regulations continue to evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. in addition, our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. in particular, section 404 of sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and auditor attestation of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. this effort has required, and will continue to require in the future, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our auditors could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. a failure to timely recruit and retain key employees would have a material adverse effect on our business. to be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. in addition, a reorganization of our operations to better address customer needs, improve operational efficiency or reduce expenses may lead to the loss of key employees. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 16 we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. there is growing pressure on public companies from stockholders, who must approve any increases in our equity pool, generally to reduce our overhang or amount of outstanding and unexercised stock options. in addition, recent accounting rules that require us to recognize on our income statement compensation expense from employee equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan have increased pressure to limit equity grants. these factors may make it more difficult for synopsys to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation. despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. catastrophic events may disrupt our business. we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. we believe we have developed sufficient disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 43 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of our investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31, 2007: carrying value weighted average total return (in thousands) money market funds (u.s.) $ 309,965 3.44 % cash equivalent investments (u.s) 4,900 4.81 % short-term investments (u.s.) 405,126 4.81 % cash deposits and money market funds

$129.9 million within one to five years, $34.7 million within five to ten years and $124.6 million after ten years. however, we consider these investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance with our investment policy, the weighted-average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and other uses including acquisitions. these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. 43 the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31, 2007 that are subject to interest rate risk by fiscal year of

foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary's local currency, except for our principal irish, swiss and hungarian subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the u.s. dollar. we engage in a program to minimize the effect of changes in the exchange rate between a given functional currency (i.e. the yen in the case of our japanese subsidiary) and the corresponding non-functional currency transactions (i.e. receivables denominated in the u.s. dollar in the case of our japanese subsidiary). we hedge the following types of non-functional-currency-denominated balances and transactions: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in the euro, british pound and canadian dollar. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements . 44 the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2007: notional amount in u.s. dollars weighted average contract rate (in thousands) forward

singapore dollar 1,717 1.57387 swedish korna 754 7.32158 swiss franc 316 1.26353 $ 185,320 these foreign currency contracts shown in the above table are denominated primarily in the euro and the japanese yen. the maximum original duration of the currency contracts shown is 15 months for our canadian dollar and british pound forward contracts, 14 months for our euro forward contracts, two months for our japanese yen and india rupee forward contracts, and one month for other currencies. due to the short - term nature of these contracts, the contract rates approximate fair value as of october 31, 2007 and 2006. 45 the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table above providing information as of october 31, 2007, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $7.5 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $7.5 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $7.5 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized gains of approximately $1.5 million and losses of $2.1 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2007 and october 31, 2006, respectively. if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, synopsys reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of sfas 133, resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of synopsys' hedging program. to correct the error, synopsys reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the year ended october 31, 2005. foreign currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. we have limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. furthermore, we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution. we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. equity risk. our strategic investment portfolio as of october 31, 2007 consists of approximately $13.6 million of minority equity investments in publicly traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately $4.9 million as of october 31, 2006. the securities of publicly traded companies are classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. during fiscal 2006 and 2005, we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $1.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively. none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes. 46risk factors 14 risk factors we describe our business risk factors below. the current severe downturn and uncertainty in the global economy in general and weakness in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular may harm our business and operating results. the worldwide economy is currently undergoing unprecedented turmoil amid stock market volatility, tightening of credit markets, concerns of inflation and deflation, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns and business insolvencies. this turmoil and the uncertainty about future economic conditions could negatively impact our customers and, among other things, postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and jeopardize or delay their ability or willingness to make payment obligations, any of which could adversely affect our business. uncertainty about current global economic conditions could also cause volatility of our stock price. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of this severe global economic downturn or subsequent recovery. in addition, the semiconductor and electronics industries are cyclical in nature and are currently experiencing a severe downturn. the eda industry has been adversely affected by many factors, including the current global downturn, ongoing efforts by semiconductor and electronics companies to reduce their spending, uncertainty regarding their long-term growth rate and underlying financial health, excess eda tool capacity and increased competition. these factors could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. if the general economy and the semiconductor and electronics industries do not improve, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results. the majority of our backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. a significant portion of revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash. although customer payment obligations are not cancelable, we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed. moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses. though we have not, to date, experienced a material level of defaults or renegotiation requests, if the current economic downturn is prolonged, our customers' financial condition and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations could be adversely affected. if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments, our operating results would be harmed. if we do not successfully compete in the eda industry our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete with eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services, primarily cadence design systems, inc., mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation, inc. we also compete with other eda vendors, including continual new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, as well as with customers' internally developed design tools and capabilities. we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license terms, post contract customer support, interoperability with our own and other vendors' products, price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly and in order to be successful we must maintain technology leadership. accordingly, we must successfully anticipate and lead critical 14 table of contents developments, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. we believe that in order to be successful we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance. we have invested significant resources into the development of our galaxy design platform, integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of our systemverilog and other advanced features and development of our manufacturing solutions and our ip and systems portfolios. customers may not find these tool and ip configurations more attractive than our competitors' offerings and our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance may not be successful. some eda vendors are increasingly offering discounts, which could be significant, as price continues to be a competitive consideration for our customers. if we do not match or are unable to match a competitor's pricing for a particular solution or if we are unable to otherwise enhance the value of our offering, we may lose business, which would result in lost revenue and could harm our operating results, particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other eda purchases with the competitor. we believe that in order to compete effectively, we need to enhance the value of our offering by providing additional rights such as multiple copies of the tools, post-contract customer support, expanded license usage related to duration, location and quantity, contractor and site access, future purchase rights and the ability to purchase pools of technology. if we do not match or are unable to match a competitor's offering, we may lose business, which would result in lost revenue and could harm our operating results. payment terms are aggressively negotiated by our customers and affect our competitive position. payment terms on time-based licenses have generally lengthened over time. longer payment terms could continue in the future, which could negatively affect our future revenue and operating cash flow. the eda industry is subject to continual consolidation. we and our competitors have historically acquired businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer they may be able to exert even greater competitive pressure by offering a more complete or larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices. despite the complexity of the eda market, entry and expansion into the eda market by new and existing companies can and does occur, and could make it more difficult to compete successfully. in addition, new competitive factors may emerge from time to time. if we fail to successfully compete as described above or fail to address new competitive forces our business will be harmed. lack of growth in new ic design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the eda industry, including demand for our products and services. the increasing complexities of socs and ics, and customers' concerns about managing costs and risks have also led to the following potentially long-term negative trends in our industry: the number of ic design starts has remained flat during the last several years. new ic design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for eda software. a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely. mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services, 15 table of contents and in some cases, increase customers' bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including synopsys. due to factors such as increased globalization, cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent, adversely impacting our customers' eda spending. industry changes, plus the cost and complexity of ic design, may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design. all of these trends, if sustained, could harm the eda industry, including the demand for our products and services, which in turn would harm our financial condition and results of operations. changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our prior financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. a change in these principles, or in our interpretations of these principles, can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. we have received a revenue agent's report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our u.s. taxable income. an adverse outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. on july 11, 2008, we received a revenue agent's report in which the internal revenue service, or irs, proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for fiscal 2002 through 2004 of approximately $236.2 million, $130.5 million of which would be a reduction of certain tax credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due in future periods. in august 2008, we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs, which will cause the matter to be referred to the appeals office of the irs. an adverse outcome of this matter could result in significant tax expense and harm our results of operations and financial condition. unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the irs examinations of our federal tax returns for the years 2000-2001 and 2002-2004 resulted in significant proposed adjustments. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions, including 16 table of contents those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of or amendments to foreign tax rulings, could materially increase our effective tax rate. furthermore, we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states. changes in our forecasts of such future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results. our revenue and earnings fluctuate and if our financial results fail to meet stockholder expectations our stock price could decline. many factors affect our revenue and earnings, including customer demand, license mix, the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold, causing our revenue and earnings results to fluctuate. accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance. from time to time, we provide targets related to our future financial performance. in addition, financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance. because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate, future financial performance is difficult to predict. downward adjustments of our targets or the failure to meet our targets or the expectations of research analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include, but are not limited to: the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers' products, customer research and development and eda budgets, pricing, our competitors' product offerings and customer design starts. it is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customers' demand for our products on a medium or long term basis. as a result, actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which, in turn, could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly disclosed targets. we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized. since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income. our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time-based license revenue. the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders, customer demand, customer payment terms and ship dates could result in lower revenue and harm our operating results. for example, if we ship more licenses generating upfront revenue than expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target; conversely, if we ship fewer licenses generating upfront revenue than expected, our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target. similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of license orders generating time-based revenue during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected. we may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externally-communicated financial targets, any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could harm our business. we often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products. although these amendments can provide a longer-term payment stream from the customers, 17 table of contents they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger. certain of our license agreements provide customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products. while this practice helps assure the customer's access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately. in the past, we have regularly received a significant portion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. the delay of one or more orders, particularly an order generating upfront revenue, could cause us to have lower revenue and/or earnings for that quarter. a large portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of customers. while our agreements with such customers are binding multi-year agreements, if we were to lose these customers or if they did not renew their agreements with us, over time our financial results could be adversely affected. we make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition, specifically determining the existence of proper documentation, establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable, verifying delivery of our products and services and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers. while we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future. in such an event, we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods, which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods. our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision. accordingly, our customers' evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles. the sales cycle for our products is lengthy. the purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer. this commitment often requires significant technical review, assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within a customer's organization. while our customers are evaluating our products and services, we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and spend significant management effort to complete these sales. any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter or the failure to complete a sale after expending resources during the sales cycle could cause our operating results to suffer. we rely on third party subcontractors to manufacture our hardware products. our reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality, a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages and pricing changes. our outsourcing model could lead to delays in product deliveries, lost sales and increased costs which could harm our relationships with our customers resulting in lower operating results. the failure to meet the semiconductor industry's demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may harm our financial results. soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing. to address greater complexity, 18 table of contents semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers. at the same time, as a general business trend, we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers' technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. if we fail to successfully manage these conflicting demands our financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. in order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development. we may not be able acquire businesses or technology and we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the business acquisitions or strategic investments we complete, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in the past and expect to make additional acquisitions of businesses or technology in the future. we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results. we have acquired a number of companies and technologies in recent years, including synplicity, inc. in may 2008. in addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into synopsys; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; regulatory delays; drain on management time for acquisition-related activities; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax, and unanticipated costs; 19 table of contents diversion of resources and unanticipated expenses resulting from litigation arising from potential or actual business acquisitions or investments; and adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships. while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, an acquisition may not positively affect our future performance. if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we will be required to write down intangible assets associated with the product or technology which would harm our operating results. conditions of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance. during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we derived approximately 50% of our revenue from outside the united states. we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from customers outside the united states. foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the effects of international political conflict, hostilities and natural disasters. further, any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states. our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our results of operations can be adversely affected when the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen and the canadian dollar, as a result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. while we hedge most foreign currency exposures of our business, we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures, and our hedging activities may not completely mitigate our foreign currency risks. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions and higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states. if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed. our operations and sales to customers internationally subject us to a number of additional risks, including: international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements; difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulatory requirements; differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices; our inability to adapt to cultural differences in the conduct of business; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; 20 table of contents financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and fluctuations in currency exchange rates; imposition of additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. our investment portfolio may be impaired by further deterioration of the capital markets. our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of october 31, 2008 consists of investment grade municipal bonds, tax-exempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds. we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer. as a result of current adverse financial market conditions, some financial instruments, such as structured investment vehicles, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, may pose risks arising from liquidity and credit concerns. as of october 31, 2008, we had no direct holdings in these categories of investments and our exposure to these financial instruments through our indirect holdings in money market mutual funds was close to 0% of total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which we do not consider to be material. as of october 31, 2008, we had no impairment charge associated with our short-term investment portfolio. however, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and our investment portfolio may suffer other than temporary impairments in future periods. we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no. 115, or sfas no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities . all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as "available-for-sale" under sfas no. 115. investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however, because any debt securities we hold are classified as "available-for-sale," no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity, net of tax. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party's intellectual property rights. as a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it. these types of claims can, however, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. 21 table of contents if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. moreover, some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. we aggressively pursue action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies. we engaged in anti-piracy efforts against certain companies located in china; but these actions may not be successful. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the sec, nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board. many of these regulations continue to evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. in addition, our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. in particular, section 404 of sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our auditors to render an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. this effort has required, and will continue to require in the future, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm could cause our stock price to decline. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. we do not expect that our disclosure controls or control system will prevent all error and all fraud. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us. 22 table of contents if we fail to timely recruit and retain key employees our business be harmed. to be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure from stockholders, who must approve any increases in our equity pool, to limit the use of such equity based compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders. in addition, we are required under u.s. gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit equity-based compensation. these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm reputation and we could lose market share. despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers' willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers' orders. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. we believe we have developed sufficient disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 48 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of our investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31, 2008: carrying value weighted average total return (in thousands) money market funds (u.s.) $ 127,304 2.34 % cash deposits and money market funds (international) 440,929 1.47 % short-term investments (u.s.) 373,669 1.87 % total interest bearing instruments $ 941,902 1.75 % as of october 31, 2008, the stated maturities of our current short-term investments are $99.3 million within one year, $93.4 million within one to five years, $41.1 million within five to ten years and $139.8 million after ten years. however, we consider these investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance with our investment policy, the weighted-average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and other uses including acquisitions. these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. 48 table of contents the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31, 2008

currency, except for our principal irish, swiss and hungarian subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the u.s. dollar. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts ranges from one month to 19 months. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2008, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $8.9 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $8.9 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, 49 table of contents resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $8.9 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized losses of approximately $15.9 million and gains of approximately $1.5 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2008 and october 31, 2007, respectively. if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2008:

equity investments in publicly traded and privately held companies compared to approximately $13.6 million as of october 31, 2007. the securities of publicly traded companies are classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. during fiscal 2008 and 2006, we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. we did not reduce the value of our strategic investment portfolio during fiscal 2007. none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes. 51 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of our investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the

our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and other uses including acquisitions. these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. the following table presents the amounts of our cash

contains financial covenants requiring that we maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash, as well as other non-financial covenants. the facility terminates on april 28, 2007. borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 0.50%; however, we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between 0.80% and 1.125% based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. in addition, commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between 0.20% and 0.25% per annum based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant. in april 2004 and may 2005, we borrowed and repaid $200.0 and $75.0 million, respectively, under the credit facility. as of october 31, 2005 and 2004, we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants. foreign currency risk. the functional currency of each of synopsys active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary local currency, except for our principal irish and swiss subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the u.s. dollar. we engage in a program to minimize the effect of changes in the exchange rate between a given functional currency (i.e. the yen in the case of our japanese subsidiary) and the corresponding non-functional currency transactions (i.e. receivables denominated in the u.s. dollar in the case of our japanese subsidiary). we hedge the following types of non-functional-currency-denominated balances and transactions: (i) certain assets and liabilities, (ii) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (iii) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (iv) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in the euro. a description of the accounting under our hedging programs is included in note 2 to our notes to consolidated financial statements . 47 the following

tables include the balances and transactions described above. the maximum original duration of the currency contracts shown is 16 months in the case of our euro forward contracts and one month in the case of contracts for other currencies. due to the short - term nature of these contracts, the contract rates approximate fair value as of october 31, 2005 and 2004. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table above, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $6.0 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $6.0 million to the counterparty upon contract 48 maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $6.0 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized loss of approximately $0.6 million and gain of $9.6 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet as of october 31, 2005 and october 31, 2004, respectively. net cash outflows on maturing forward contracts during the three months ended october 31, 2005 were $2.9 million. if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, synopsys reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of sfas 133, resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of synopsys hedging program. to correct the error, synopsys reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income in the three months ended january 31, 2005. foreign currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. we have limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. furthermore, we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution. we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. equity risk. our strategic investment portfolio as of october 31, 2005 consists of approximately $8.0 million of minority equity investments in publicly traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately $12.8 million as of october 31, 2004. the securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. during fiscal 2005 and 2004, we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $4.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively. 49risk factors 11 risk factors- stagnation of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance and is incorporated by reference here. historically, our orders and revenue have been lowest in our first quarter and highest in our fourth quarter, with a material decline between the fourth quarter of one fiscal year and the first quarter of the next fiscal year, although the timing of major license renewals can alter this trend. under our previous license model, revenue seasonality resulted principally from the decline in the amount of upfront orders from the fourth quarter of one fiscal year to the first quarter of the next fiscal year. however, as a result of the shift in our license model, as more fully described in part ii, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations , we experienced significantly less revenue seasonality during fiscal 2005 and 2006 and we expect revenue seasonality to be minimal in the foreseeable future, although orders seasonality may continue. synopsys aggregate backlog was approximately $2.01 billion on october 31, 2006, representing a 4% increase from backlog of $1.92 billion on october 31, 2005. aggregate backlog includes deferred revenue, operational backlog and financial backlog. deferred revenue represents that portion of orders for software products, license maintenance and other services which have been delivered and billed to the customer but on which the revenue has not yet been recognized. operational backlog consists of orders for software products and maintenance that have not been shipped and orders for consulting services that have not yet been performed and accepted. financial backlog consists of future installments not yet due and payable under existing time-based licenses and maintenance contracts. we have not historically experienced material order cancellations. 8 the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our five product groups established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years. we include revenue from companies or products we have acquired during the periods covered from the acquisition date through the end of the relevant periods. for presentation purposes, we allocate maintenance revenue, which represented approximately 9%, 14% and 16% of our total revenue in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, to the products to which those support services related. fy 2006 fy 2005 fy 2004 galaxy design platform 52 % 56 % 62 % discovery verification platform 24 % 22 % 21 % ip 8 % 7 % 6 % design for manufacturing 11 % 10 % 7 %

platforms and to expand our design for manufacturing and ip product offerings. research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. in addition, an advanced technology group within synopsys silicon engineering group explores new technologies and maintains strong research relationships outside synopsys with both industry and academia. during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, research and development expenses, excluding capitalized software development costs, were $370.6 million, $320.9 million and $288.8 million, respectively. synopsys capitalized software development costs were approximately $3.5 million, $3.0 million, and $2.7 million in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. competition the eda industry is highly competitive. we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers own design tools and internal design capabilities. in general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors products, price and payment terms. our competitors include companies that offer a broad range of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation, and companies that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, such as magma design automation, inc. in recent years, we have increasingly competed on the basis of payment terms and price. in certain situations, in order to win business we must offer substantial discounts on our products due to competitive factors. in other situations, we may lose potential business to a competitor offering a lower price. product sales and licensing agreements we typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network, including, in some cases, regional or global networks. license fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed. 9 in certain cases, we provide our customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products. for example, a customer may use our front-end design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end placement software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer ic design. this practice helps assure the customer access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. the customer re-mix of product, when so provided under the customer agreement, does not alter the timing of recognition of the license fees paid by the customer, which is governed by our revenue recognition policies. the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor. at the same time, because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without re-mix rights. we currently offer our software products under various license types, including renewable tsls, term licenses and perpetual licenses. for a full discussion of these licenses, see part ii, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations revenue background . with respect to our designware core intellectual property products, we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications. fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties. finally, our global technical services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project. proprietary rights synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. however, third parties may develop similar technology independently. in addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries. we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, in many cases we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party intellectual property rights. as a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. for example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue this defense. employees as of october 31, 2006, synopsys had 5,130 employees, with 2,842 based in north america and 2,288 based outside of north america. acquisitions in fiscal 2006 for information about acquisitions we completed during fiscal 2006, please see part ii, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated by reference here. 10 item 1a. risk factors weakness, budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our business. in recent years, we believe that eda industry growth has been adversely affected by many factors, including ongoing efforts by semiconductor companies to control their spending, uncertainty regarding the long-term growth rate of the semiconductor industry, excess eda tool capacity of some of our customers and increased competition in the eda industry itself causing pricing pressure on eda vendors. if these factors persist or additional semiconductor industry growth does not occur (or if we do not benefit from any such increases), our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. we also believe that, over the long term, growth in eda spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor r&amp;d spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market. however, we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues, r&amp;d spending or spending on eda products, nor whether we will benefit from any of these increases should they occur. for example, although the semiconductor industry grew by 28% in 2004 and 7% in 2005, eda industry revenue growth during this period was below these levels. competition in the eda industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. we compete with other eda vendors that offer a broad range of products and services, primarily cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation and with other eda vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, such as magma design automation, inc. we also compete with customers internally developed design tools and capabilities. if we fail to compete effectively, our business will be materially and adversely affected. we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of use), time-to-results, post-sale support, interoperability with our own and other vendors products, price and payment terms. additional competitive challenges include the following: price continues to be a competitive factor . we believe that some eda vendors are increasingly offering discounts, which could be significant. if we are unable to match a competitor pricing for a particular solution, we may lose business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other eda purchase with the competitor. technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly . accordingly, we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. if we fail to do so, our business will be materially and adversely affected. to compete effectively, we believe we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance. we have invested significant resources into further development of our galaxy design platform, integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of its system verilog and other advanced features and development of our design for manufacturing and ip portfolios. we can provide no assurance that our customers will find these tool and ip configurations more attractive than our competitors offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance will be successful. payment terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated by our customers . during the second half of fiscal 2003 and continuing through 2006, payment terms on time-based licenses lengthened compared to prior periods, negatively affecting our cash flow from 11 operations. longer payment terms could continue in the future, which would negatively affect our future operating cash flow. lack of growth in new ic design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the eda industry, including demand for our products and services. the increasing complexity of socs and ics, and customers concerns about managing cost and risk have also led to the following potentially long-term negative trends: the number of ic design starts has remained flat during the last three years. new ic design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for eda software. a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely. mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services, and in some cases, increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including synopsys. due to factors such as increased globalization, cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent, adversely impacting our customers eda spending. industry changes, plus the cost and complexity of ic design, may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design, or using field programmable gate arrays (fpgas), an alternative chip technology. all of these trends, if sustained, could have a material adverse effect on the eda industry, including the demand for our products and services, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. changes in, or interpretations of, accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our prior financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. a change in these principles, or in our interpretations of these principles, can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. for example, in september 2006, the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no. 108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements , (sab 108). sab 108 addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet (iron curtain) and an income statement (rollover) approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. in the year of adoption, sab 108 allows a one-time cumulative effect transition adjustment for errors that were not previously deemed material, but are material under the guidance in sab 108. the guidance in sab 108 must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november 15, 2006. synopsys will be required to adopt the provisions of sab 108 in fiscal 2007. synopsys is currently evaluating the requirements of sab 108 and the potential impact upon adoption. historically, synopsys has evaluated uncorrected differences utilizing the rollover approach. although synopsys believes its prior period assessments of uncorrected differences utilizing the rollover approach and the conclusions reached regarding its quantitative and qualitative assessments of such uncorrected differences were appropriate, synopsys expects that, due to the analysis required in sab 108, certain historical uncorrected differences 12 during fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2003 related to share-based compensation and fixed assets, will be corrected upon adoption and reflected in the opening retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007. there can be no assurance that the sec will not disagree with our conclusions. synopsys has not yet completed its analysis of sab 108, however, it estimates that the expected net reduction to its opening retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007 will be approximately $10 to $12 million. synopsys is continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting sab 108 and, as a result, the actual change to opening retained earnings balance for fiscal 2007 could be different than the estimate. in addition, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, synopsys was required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no. 123 (revised 2004), share-based payment , (sfas123(r)), which requires the measurement of all share-based compensation to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value-based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations. the adoption of sfas 123(r) had, and is expected to continue to have, a material effect on our reported financial results. we have received a revenue agent report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our u.s. taxable income. an adverse outcome of this examination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions and to review or audit by irs and state, local and foreign tax authorities. in connection with an irs audit of our united states federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, on june 8, 2005, we received a revenue agent report in which the irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 of approximately $476.8 million, plus interest. interest accrues on the amount of any deficiency finally determined until paid, and compounds daily at the federal underpayment rate, which adjusts quarterly. this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. we have filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs and the matter is currently under appeal with the irs. we expect to begin the appeals process during 2007. however, final resolution of this matter could take a considerable time, possibly years. we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustments and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws, and that we thus have meritorious defenses to these proposals. accordingly, we will continue to challenge these proposed adjustments vigorously. while we believe the irs asserted adjustments are not supported by applicable law, we believe it is probable we will be required to make additional payments in order to resolve this matter. however, based on our analysis to date, we believe we have adequately provided for this matter. if we determine our provision for this matter to be inadequate or if we are required to pay a significant amount of additional u.s. taxes and applicable interest in excess of our provision for this matter, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. in addition, our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also undergoing an audit of our united states federal 13 income tax returns for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit, there could be a material adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. finally, we have large operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. in addition, certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions and expiration of foreign tax holidays could materially increase our effective tax rate. our revenue and earnings fluctuate, which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline. many factors affect our revenue and earnings, including customer demand, license mix, the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold and committed expense levels, making it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period. accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance. if our financial results or targets do not meet investor and analyst expectations, our stock price could decline. some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include, but are not limited to: we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized. since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income. our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time-based licenses. the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders, customer demand, preferred customer payment terms and requested customer ship dates could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. for example, if we ship more upfront licenses than expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target; conversely, if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target. similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of time-based license orders during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected. we may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externally-communicated financial targets, any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could adversely affect our business. the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers products, customer r&amp;d and eda tool budgets, pricing, our competitors product offerings and customer design starts. it is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customer demand for our products on a medium or long term basis. as a result, actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which, in turn could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly-disclosed targets. we often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products. although these amendments can provide a longer-term payment stream from the customers, they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger. 14 certain of our upfront and time-based license agreements provide customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products. while this practice helps assure the customer access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately. in the past, we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. the delay of one or more orders, particularly an upfront order, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and/or earnings for that quarter. we make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition, specifically determining the existence of proper documentation, establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable, verifying delivery of our software and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers. while we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future. in such an event, we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods, which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods. our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision. accordingly, our customers evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. further, sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles. the failure to meet the semiconductor industry demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may adversely affect our financial result s. soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing. to address greater complexity, semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers. at the same time, as a general business trend, we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. failure to manage these conflicting demands successfully would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. customer payment defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. our backlog consists principally of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. these customer obligations are typically not cancelable, but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed. in these cases, we will generally take legal action to recover amounts owed. moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses. though we have not, to date, experienced a material level of defaults, any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project. we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future. 15 in addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; regulatory delays; drain on management time for acquisition-related activities; assumption of unknown liabilities; and adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships. while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will positively affect our future performance. furthermore, if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we could be required to write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the product or technology; any such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. stagnation of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance. during each of fiscal 2006 and 2005, we derived 49% of our revenue from outside the united states; going forward, we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from outside the united states. foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the effects of international political conflict, hostilities and natural disasters. further, any stagnation of foreign economies would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states. our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our results of operations can be adversely affected when the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, including the euro, the japanese yen and the canadian dollar, as a result of the conversion of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. while we hedge certain foreign currency exposures of our business, there can be no assurance our hedging activities will completely mitigate our foreign currency risks. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions locally and higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states. the failure to effectively manage our global operations would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe on a third party intellectual property rights. as a result, we are 16 from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. for example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. in addition, we are currently in patent litigation with magma design, inc., one of our competitors. we believe these claims are without merit and will continue to vigorously pursue them. these types of claims can, however, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. a failure to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. to protect this technology, we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide. we can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. moreover, certain foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property; our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. we have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies. for example, we are pursuing anti-piracy cases against several companies located in china. however, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation may reduce our net income. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the sec, nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board. many of these regulations have only recently been enacted, and continue to evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. in addition, our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. in particular, section 404 of sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and auditor attestation of that assessment in our annual reports. this effort has required, and will continue to require in the future, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain our auditors attestation could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. a failure to timely recruit and retain key employees or for any reorganizations to be effective would have a material adverse effect on our business. to be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales 17 and managerial employees would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. from time to time, we may reorganize our operations for a number of reasons, including to better address customer needs, improve operational efficiency and reduce expenses. while we undertake any such reorganization with the expectation that it will result in improve performance, there can be no assurance that a reorganization will in fact improve our operations or that it will not lead to the loss of key employees. we issue stock options and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. there is growing pressure on public companies from stockholders, who must approve any increases in our stock option pool, generally to reduce our overhang or amount of outstanding and unexercised stock options. in addition, our adoption of new accounting rules that require us to recognize on our income statement compensation expense from employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan may increase pressure to limit future option grants. these factors may make it more difficult for synopsys to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation. despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 46 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of our investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted-average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31, 2006: carrying value weighted average total return (in thousands) money market funds (u.s.) $ 179,457 3.31 % short-term investments (u.s.) 241,963

investments are $51.6 million within one year, $91.2 million within one to five years, $10.5 million within five to ten years and $88.7 million after ten years. however, we consider these investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance with our investment policy, the weighted-average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and other uses including acquisitions. these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october 31, 2006 that are subject to

functional currency of each of synopsys active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary local currency, except for our principal irish and swiss subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the u.s. dollar. we engage in a program to minimize the effect of changes in the exchange rate between a given functional currency (i.e. the yen in the case of our japanese subsidiary) and the corresponding non-functional currency transactions (i.e. receivables denominated in the u.s. dollar in the case of our japanese subsidiary). we hedge the following types of non-functional-currency-denominated balances and transactions: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in the euro and british pound. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 of notes to consolidated financial statements . the following table provides information about our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2006: amount in u.s. dollars weighted average contract

described above. the maximum original duration of the currency contracts shown is 15 months for our euro forward contracts, 12 months for our british pound forward contracts and one month for other currencies. due to the short - term nature of these contracts, the contract rates approximate fair value as of october 31, 2006 and 2005. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table above providing information as of october 31, 2006, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $6.9 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $6.9 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $6.9 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized losses of approximately $2.1 million and $0.6 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2006 and october 31, 2005, respectively. if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, synopsys reevaluated its interpretation of certain provisions of sfas 133, resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions. the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of synopsys hedging program. to correct the error, synopsys reclassified the remaining $3.0 million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in the three months ended january 31, 2005. 48 foreign currency contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities contain credit risk in that the counterparty may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. we have limited these agreements to major financial institutions to reduce this credit risk. furthermore, we monitor the potential risk of loss with any one financial institution. we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative purposes. equity risk. our strategic investment portfolio as of october 31, 2006 consists of approximately $4.9 million of minority equity investments in publicly traded and in privately held companies compared to approximately $8.1 million as of october 31, 2005. the securities of publicly traded companies are generally classified as available-for-sale securities accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no. 115, accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities, and are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. during fiscal 2006 and 2005, we reduced the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $1.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively. during the fiscal year ended october 31, 2006, the prior investments of $1.9 million and $1.7 million in hpl and virtio were included in the purchase price. none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes. see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 49risk factors 10 risk factors we describe our business risk factors below. the recent global recession and continued uncertainty in the global economy, and weakness in the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. the global economy has recently experienced a major recession, stock market volatility, tightened credit markets, concerns about both deflation and inflation, reduced demand for products, lower consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, liquidity concerns and business insolvencies. these declines, and uncertainty about future economic conditions, could continue to negatively impact our customers businesses, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of the global economic downturn or any subsequent recovery, so our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. in addition, the eda industry has been adversely affected by many factors, including the global recession, ongoing efforts by semiconductor and electronics companies to reduce spending, uncertainty regarding long-term growth rates and underlying financial health of various economies around the world, excess eda tool capacity and increased competition. these factors could, among other things, limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. if general economic conditions, and particularly conditions in the semiconductor and electronics industries, do not improve, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. in the event that downward fluctuations in the semiconductor or electronics industries or general economic conditions persist or worsen for any extended period of time, or fail to significantly improve, our revenues and financial results will be adversely affected. a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a period of time, generating recurring revenue for us, generally over a three-year period. under our business model, we generally expect more than 90% of our total revenue to be recurring revenue. historically, short-term fluctuations in industry or general economic conditions or in orders generally do not immediately affect our financial results due to our business model. while the electronics, semiconductor and eda industries have recently experienced severe weakness and uncertainty due to the downturn in the global economic recession, to date, our business model has substantially protected our financial results. nevertheless, our business model and longer-term financial results are not immune from sustained economic downturns. the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions have caused some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. continued periods of decreased committed average annual revenue, additional customer bankruptcies, or consolidation among our customers, could adversely affect our year-over-year revenue growth and could further decrease our backlog. accordingly, if economic conditions further deteriorate or fail to significantly improve for any extended period of time, our future revenues and financial results will be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvement in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results will be deferred due to our business model. customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results. the majority of our backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. a significant portion of revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash from customers. although customer payment obligations are not cancelable, we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default, declare bankruptcy, or 10 table of contents otherwise fail to pay amounts owed as occurs from time to time in an economic downturn. moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses. our customers financial condition and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations could be adversely affected by current economic conditions. if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments, our operating results would be harmed. if we do not successfully compete in the eda industry our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, primarily cadence design systems, inc., mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation, inc. we also compete with other eda vendors, including frequent new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, as well as with our customers internally developed design tools and capabilities. we compete principally on the basis of technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability with our products and other vendors products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly, so in order to be successful we must maintain technology leadership. accordingly, we must anticipate and lead critical development cycles, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products. we believe that in order to be successful we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance. we have invested significant resources into the development of our galaxy design platform, integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of our systemverilog and other advanced features and development of our manufacturing solutions and our ip and systems portfolios. customers may not find these tool and ip configurations more attractive than our competitors offerings and our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance may not be successful. many eda vendors offer price discounts, which could be increasingly significant as price continues to be a competitive consideration for our customers. if we do not match a competitor pricing for a particular solution, or otherwise enhance the value of our offering, we may lose business, which would result in lost revenue and could harm our operating results, particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate a substantial portion of their eda purchases with the competitor. in order to compete effectively, we believe we need to enhance the value of our offering by providing additional rights such as multiple copies of the tools, post-contract customer support, expanded license usage related to duration, location and quantity, contractor and site access, future purchase rights and the ability to purchase pools of technology. if we do not match or are unable to match a competitor offering, we may lose business, which would result in lost revenue and could harm our operating results. payment terms are aggressively negotiated by our customers and affect our competitive position. payment terms on time-based licenses have generally lengthened over time. longer payment terms could continue in the future, which could negatively affect our future revenue and operating cash flow. the eda industry is subject to continual consolidation. we and our competitors have historically acquired businesses and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to exert even greater competitive pressure by offering a more complete or larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices. despite the complexity of the eda market, entry and expansion into the eda market by new and existing companies can and does occur, and could make it more difficult to compete successfully. 11 table of contents in addition, new competitive factors may emerge from time to time. if we fail to successfully compete as described above or fail to address new competitive forces, our business will be harmed. lack of growth in new ic design starts, industry consolidation and other potentially long-term trends may adversely affect the eda industry, including demand for our products and services. the increasing complexities of socs and ics, and customers concerns about managing costs and risks, have produced the following long-term and potentially negative trends in our industry: the number of ic design starts has decreased and may continue to decline. new ic design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for eda software. a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely. mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services, and in some cases, increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers, including synopsys. factors such as increased globalization and the recent global recession have made cost controls among our customers more permanent, adversely impacting our customers eda spending. industry changes, plus the cost and complexity of ic design, may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general, to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design to companies using our competitors products. these trends, if sustained, could harm the eda industry, including the demand for our products and services, which in turn would harm our financial condition and results of operations. changes in accounting principles and guidance, or their interpretation, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our previously-filed financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. a change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. we have received a revenue agent report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our u.s. taxable income. an adverse outcome could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. in july 2008, we received a revenue agent report in which the internal revenue service (irs) proposed an adjustment that would result in an aggregate tax deficiency for fiscal 2002 through 2004 of approximately $236.2 million, $130.5 million of which would be a reduction of certain tax credits that would otherwise be available either as refund claims or to offset taxes due in future periods. in august 2008, we timely filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs. in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we reached a tentative settlement with the examination division of the irs that would resolve this matter. the settlement is subject to further review and approval within the federal government, including the joint committee on taxation of the u.s. congress, which could take several more months. final resolution of this matter could take considerable time and may not be finally approved by the government, in which case, while the company believes it is still adequately provided for regarding this matter, there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of this matter could result in significant tax expense and harm our results of operations and financial condition. 12 table of contents unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. currently, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states, and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the united states. united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-united states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. in may 2009, the president of the united states and the u.s. treasury department proposed changing certain of the u.s. tax rules for u.s. corporations doing business outside the united states. specific legislation has not yet been proposed or enacted, but it is possible that such proposed changes would lessen the benefit of deductions and credits related to income earned outside of the united states and result in the loss of deferral of income tax on earnings of certain of our foreign affiliates, all of which could materially increase our effective tax rate and our cash payments of income taxes. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the irs examinations of our federal tax returns for the years 2000-2001 and 2002-2004 resulted in significant proposed adjustments. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of or amendments to foreign tax rulings, could materially increase our effective tax rate. furthermore, we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states. changes in our forecasts of such future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results. our revenue and earnings fluctuate and if our financial results fail to meet stockholder expectations our stock price could decline. many factors may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate, including changing customer demand, license mix, the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold, acquisition expenses, impairment charges and restructuring charges. accordingly, stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance. from time to time, we provide projections describing our expected future financial performance. in addition, financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance. because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate, future financial performance is difficult to predict. downward adjustments of our targets or the failure to meet our targets or the expectations of research analysts could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. the factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter include, but are not limited to: the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including consumer demand for our customers products, customer budgets for research and development and eda spending, pricing, our competitors product offerings and customer design starts. it is difficult to 13 table of contents predict the effect of these and other factors on our customers demand for our products on a medium or long term basis, and it is particularly difficult to predict demand after a severe economic recession that has affected businesses worldwide. as a result, actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which, in turn, could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly disclosed targets. we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized. since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue, any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income. our publicly-disclosed targets for revenue and earnings assume a particular level of orders and mix between upfront and time-based license revenue. the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders, customer demand, customer payment terms and ship dates could result in lower revenue and harm our operating results. for example, if we ship more licenses generating upfront revenue than expected during any given fiscal period, our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target; conversely, if we ship fewer licenses generating upfront revenue than expected, our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target. similarly, if we receive a lower-than-expected level of license orders generating time-based revenue during a given period, our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected. we may implement cost control measures in an effort to meet our publicly-disclosed financial targets, and there can be no assurance that any such measures will achieve the anticipated cost savings, or will do so without harming our business. we often amend our customer contracts to extend the term or add new products. although these amendments can produce larger or longer-term payment streams from customers, they can also reduce the revenue being recognized per year even if the total value of the extended contract is larger. some of our license agreements provide customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products. while this practice helps assure the customer access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product, use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately. in the past, we have regularly received a significant portion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter. the delay of one or more orders, particularly orders generating upfront revenue, could cause us to have lower revenue and/or earnings for that quarter. a large portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of large customers. while our agreements with such customers are binding multi-year agreements, if we were to lose these customers or if they did not renew their agreements with us, over time our financial results could be adversely affected. we make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition, specifically determining the existence of proper documentation, establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable, verifying delivery of our products and services and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers. while we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future. in such an event, we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods, which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods. our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products, either alone or against competing products, before making a purchase decision. those customer evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters. in addition, customers may delay purchases due to budgetary constraints or budget cycles. 14 table of contents the sales cycle for our products is lengthy. the purchase of our products generally involves a significant commitment of capital and other resources by a customer. this commitment often requires significant technical review, assessment of competitive products and approval at a number of management levels within a customer organization. while our customers are evaluating our products and services, we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and spend significant management effort to complete these sales. any delay in completing sales in a particular quarter or the failure to complete a sale after expending resources during the sales cycle could cause our operating results to suffer. we rely on third party subcontractors to manufacture our hardware products. our reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality, a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages, pricing changes and the third parties financial viability. our outsourcing model could lead to delays in product deliveries, lost sales and increased costs which could harm our relationships with our customers resulting in lower operating results. the failure to meet the semiconductor industry demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may harm our financial results. soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing. to address greater complexity, semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers. at the same time, as a general business trend, we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. if we fail to successfully manage these conflicting demands our financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. if new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. in order to remain competitive, we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development. we may not be able to acquire businesses or technology and we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the business acquisitions or strategic investments we complete, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in the past and expect to make additional acquisitions of businesses or technology in the future. we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results. we have acquired a number of companies and technologies in recent years. in addition to direct costs, acquisitions pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; 15 table of contents difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into synopsys; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; regulatory delays; drain on management time for acquisition-related activities; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax, and unanticipated costs; diversion of resources and unanticipated expenses resulting from litigation arising from potential or actual business acquisitions or investments; adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships; and negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of the new accounting standard codification (asc) 805, business combinations , which will apply to our acquisitions beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal 2010. while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us, an acquisition may not positively affect our future performance. if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology, we will be required to write down intangible assets associated with the product or technology which would harm our operating results. conditions of foreign economies, foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance. we derive approximately half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states. foreign sales are vulnerable to regional and worldwide economic, political and health conditions, including the effects of international political conflict, hostilities and natural disasters. further, any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states. our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our results of operations can be adversely affected when the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, as a result of the translation of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the u.s. dollar. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. while we hedge most foreign currency exposures of our business, we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures, and our hedging activities may not completely mitigate our foreign currency risks. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions and higher international sales, this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states. if we fail to effectively manage our global operations our business and results of operations will be harmed. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of special risks, including: international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements; difficulties in complying with foreign laws and regulatory requirements; 16 table of contents differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices, or other foreign laws and regulatory requirements; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; export or import restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; financial risks such as longer payment cycles, difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. our investment portfolio may become impaired. our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of october 31, 2009 consisted of investment grade municipal bonds, tax-exempt money market mutual funds and taxable money market mutual funds. recent economic conditions have increased the risk of credit downgrades in financial markets and we may suffer losses if our bond holdings are downgraded. however, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor, manage and limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. the policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer. all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available-for-sale under asc 320, investments debt and equity securities . investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. however, because any debt securities we hold are classified as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders equity, net of tax. during the fiscal year ended october 31, 2009, we had no impairment charge associated with our short-term investment portfolio. however, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and our investment portfolio may suffer other than temporary impairments in future periods. our banking partners may become insolvent or otherwise default on their obligations. we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts, provide credit under our revolving credit facility and provide banking transaction and deposit services worldwide. should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations, it could have a material impact on our financial results and reduce our credit availability. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party intellectual property rights. as a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. we are currently defending some of 17 table of contents our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it. these types of claims can, however, result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. moreover, some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. we aggressively pursue action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies. we engaged in anti-piracy efforts against certain companies located in china; but these actions may not be successful. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the sec, nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board. many of these regulations continue to evolve, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. in addition, our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. in particular, section 404 of the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002 and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and requires our auditors to render an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports. this effort has required, and will continue to require in the future, the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm could cause our stock price to decline. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. we do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal control system will prevent all error and all fraud. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource 18 table of contents constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us. if we fail to timely recruit and retain key employees our business may be harmed. to be successful, we must attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure from stockholders, who must approve any increases in our equity pool, to limit the use of such equity based compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders. in addition, we are required under u.s. gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee share-based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan which has increased the pressure to limit share-based compensation. these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive share-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products, software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. we believe we have developed sufficient disaster recovery plans and backup systems 19 table of contents to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. 39 table of contents the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31, 2009: carrying value weighted average total return (in thousands) money market funds (u.s.) $ 141,418 0.017 % cash deposits

maturities of our current short-term investments are $88.0 million within one year, $182.1 million within one to five years, $64.8 million within five to ten years and $131.8 million after ten years. however, we consider these investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance with our investment policy, the weighted average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and other uses including acquisitions. these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and investments as of october

are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary local currency, except for our principal irish, hungarian, and swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are the u.s. dollar. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future 40 table of contents intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 19 months. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2009, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $9.9 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $9.9 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.9 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized gain of approximately $9.6 million and loss of approximately $16.0 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2009 and october 31, 2008, respectively. if our estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides information about the absolute values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2009: gross

is a world leader in providing technology solutions used to develop electronics and electronic systems. we supply the electronic design automation (eda) software that engineers use to design, create prototypes for and test integrated circuits, also known as chips. we also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits. our intellectual property (ip) products are pre-designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves. to complement these product offerings, we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems. corporate information we incorporated in 1986 in north carolina and reincorporated in delaware in 1987. our headquarters are located at 700 east middlefield road, mountain view, california 94043, and our telephone number there is (650) 584-5000. we have approximately 70 offices worldwide. our annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, proxy statements relating to our annual meetings of stockholders, current reports on form 8-k and amendments to these reports, as well as filings made by our executive officers and directors, are available on our internet website (www.synopsys.com) free of charge. we post these reports to our website as soon as practicable after we file them with, or furnish them to, the u.s. securities and exchange commission (www.sec.gov). the contents of our website are not part of this form 10-k. background the proliferation of consumer and wireless products, the growth of the internet, and the development of higher speed computers and more robust visual communication systems, as well as the increasing electronics content in automotive, defense and other applications, has created demand for integrated circuits and systems with greater functionality and performance, reduced size, and less power consumption, at lower prices. these demands, as well as ever-shortening time-to-market requirements, introduce challenges for all participants in the production of these products, from designers and manufacturers of chips and electronic systems to equipment manufacturers. it is not uncommon for a single chip to contain many discrete sections (processor, communications, memory, custom logic, input/output) that may have been implemented on separate chips in previous generations. this combination of many chips into a single system-on-chip (soc) results in highly complex designs. the most complex chips today contain more than a billion transistors, the basic building blocks for integrated circuits, each of which may have features that are less than 1/1,000th the diameter of a human hair. the designer task is to determine where each of those billion transistors should be located and how they should be connected to each other, verify that the resulting design behaves as intended, and ensure that the design can be manufactured cost-effectively. this task is a complicated, multi-step process which is both expensive and time-consuming. errors can be especially costly. synopsys provides the software tools, hardware and other technologies to help designers of complex integrated circuits and systems. we offer a wide range of products that address the different 2 table of contents steps in the overall design process, both for the design of individual integrated circuits and for the design of larger systems. synopsys products can increase designer productivity and efficiency by automating tasks, keeping track of large amounts of design data, adding intelligence to the design process, facilitating reuse of past designs and reducing errors. our global service and support engineers also provide expert technical support and design assistance to our customers. products and services our products and services are organized into four groups: core eda (which includes the galaxy design platform, the discovery verification platform and our fpga (field programmable gate array) design products), intellectual property (ip) and system-level solutions, manufacturing solutions, and professional services. core eda products the process of designing integrated circuits contains many complex steps: architecture definition, rtl (register transfer level) design, functional/rtl verification, logic design or synthesis, gate-level verification, floorplanning, and place and route, to name just a few. designers use our core eda products to automate the integrated circuit design process and to reduce errors. we offer a large number of core eda products intended to address the process comprehensively. our core eda products generally fall into the following suites: the galaxy design platform, which includes tools to design an integrated circuit, the discovery verification platform, which includes tools to verify that an integrated circuit behaves as intended, and the fpga design products. galaxy design platform our galaxy design platform provides our customers with a single, integrated chip design solution that includes industry-leading individual products and incorporates common libraries and consistent timing, delay calculation and constraints throughout the design process. the platform allows designers the flexibility to integrate internally-developed and third-party tools. with this advanced functionality, common foundation and flexibility, our galaxy design platform helps reduce design times, decrease integration costs and minimize the risks inherent in advanced, complex integrated circuit designs. our products span both digital and analog/mixed-signal designs. the principal products included in the galaxy design platform are the ic compiler physical design solution, design compiler &reg; logic synthesis product, galaxy custom designer &reg; physical design solution for analog/mixed-signal designs, primetime &reg; /primetime si timing analysis products, starrc product for extraction, and the hercules and ic validator physical verification product family. the lynx design system is a production-ready chip implementation environment that combines a complete galaxy-based design flow, gui-based runtime automation, design metrics capture and reporting, and utilities that automate the configuration of pre-validated foundry data. the lynx design system helps customers improve their productivity and optimally deploy synopsys tools and methodologies. discovery verification platform our discovery verification platform is a comprehensive, integrated portfolio of functional, analog/mixed-signal, formal and low-power verification products. the platform includes our simulation and verification products and design-for-verification methodologies, and provides a consistent control environment to help significantly improve the speed, breadth and accuracy of our customers 3 table of contents verification efforts. the discovery verification platform components support industry standards and span both digital and analog/mixed-signal designs. the principal products included in the discovery verification platform are the vcs &reg; comprehensive rtl verification solution, formality &reg; formal verification sign-off solution, nanosim &reg; fastspice circuit simulation and analysis product, hsim &reg; hierarchical fastspice circuit simulation and analysis product, hspice &reg; circuit simulator, and customsim circuit simulation solution. fpga design products fpgas are complex chips that can be customized or programmed to perform a specific function after they are manufactured. for fpga design, we offer synplify &reg; pro and premier implementation and identify &reg; debug software tools. intellectual property (ip) and system-level solutions ip products as more functionality converges into a single device, the number of third-party provided ip blocks is rapidly increasing. synopsys is a leading provider of high-quality, silicon-proven ip solutions for soc designs. the broad designware ip portfolio includes high quality solutions for widely used interfaces such as usb, pci express &reg; , ddr, ethernet, sata and hdmi. in addition, synopsys offers analog ip for high definition video, analog-to-digital data conversion, and audio. with our recent acquisition of virage logic corporation, we added embedded memories, including srams and non-volatile memory, logic libraries, embedded test and repair ip and configurable processor cores, to our ip portfolio. system-level solutions today complex chips are really socs. by optimizing the design earlier in the development cycle, at the system level, customers can reduce time-to-market, development costs and power consumption. synopsys has the industry broadest portfolio of tools, models and services for the system-level design of socs. primary system-level products include platform architect for architectural optimization, spw and system studio for algorithm design, processor designer for custom processor design, and synphony model and c compiler for high level synthesis. in addition to these tools for the system-level design of socs, our portfolio includes prototyping tools for hardware verification, software development and hardware-software integration. with fpga-based prototyping systems (haps), designers can speed embedded software development by three to six months with near real runtime speeds and real world interfaces, such as our pre-tested designware ip components. the haps hardware systems are a modular, scalable and accurate way to model a chip. virtual prototypes are fully functional software models of an soc or oem system. our virtual prototyping solutions enable software engineers to start soc and application software up to twelve months before traditional methods. manufacturing solutions as technology progresses, features on integrated circuits become smaller and more difficult to manufacture, which results in lower yields of usable chips. our manufacturing solutions products and technologies address this problem by introducing manufacturability and yield considerations early in the design process, thereby improving yields. for example, some of our manufacturing solutions 4 table of contents address mask-making and yield enhancement of very small-geometry integrated circuits, as well as high-level modeling of physical effects within the integrated circuit. our manufacturing solutions include the technology-cad (tcad) device modeling products, proteus opc optical proximity correction (opc) products, cats &reg; mask data preparation product, and yield management solutions, including odyssey and recipe manager and editor (rme), and yield explorer. professional services and training synopsys provides consulting and design services that address all phases of the soc development process. these services assist synopsys customers with new tool and methodology adoption, chip architecture and specification development, functional and low power design and verification, and physical implementation and signoff. we also provide a broad range of expert training and workshops on our latest tools and methodologies. customer service and technical support a high level of customer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products. we provide technical support for our products through both field-based and corporate-based application engineering teams. customers who purchase technology subscription licenses (tsls) receive software maintenance services bundled with their license fee. customers who purchase term licenses and perpetual licenses may purchase these services separately. see product sales and licensing agreements below. software maintenance services include minor product enhancements, bug fixes and access to our technical support center for primary support. software maintenance also includes access to solvnet, our web-based support solution that gives customers access to synopsys complete design knowledge database. updated daily, solvnet includes documentation, design tips and answers to user questions. customers can also engage, for additional charges, our worldwide network of applications consultants for additional support needs. in addition, synopsys also offers training workshops designed to increase customer design proficiency and productivity with our products. workshops cover synopsys products and methodologies used in our design and verification flows, as well as specialized modules addressing system design, logic design, physical design, simulation and test. we offer regularly scheduled public and private courses in a variety of locations worldwide, as well as virtual classroom on-demand and live online training. product warranties we generally warrant our products to be free from defects in media and to substantially conform to material specifications for a period of 90 days for our software products and for up to six months for our hardware products. in certain cases, we also provide our customers with limited indemnification with respect to claims that their use of our software products infringe on united states patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets. we have not experienced material warranty or indemnity claims to date, although we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. support for industry standards we actively create and support standards that help our customers increase productivity, facilitate efficient design flows, improve interoperability of tools from different vendors, and ensure connectivity, 5 table of contents functionality and interoperability of ip building blocks. standards in the electronic design industry can be established by formal accredited organizations, from industry consortia, by company licensing made available to all, from de facto usage, or through open source licensing. synopsys products support more than 60 standards, including the most commonly used hardware description languages: systemverilog, verilog, vhdl, and systemc. our products utilize numerous industry standard data formats, application programming interfaces, and databases for the exchange of design data among our tools, other eda vendors products, and applications that customers develop internally. we also comply with a wide range of industry standards within our ip product family to ensure usability and interconnectivity. sales, distribution and backlog we market our products and services primarily through direct sales in the united states and principal foreign markets. we typically distribute our software products and documentation to customers electronically, but provide physical media (i.e., cd-roms) when requested by the customer. we maintain sales/support centers throughout the united states. outside the united states, we maintain sales, support or service offices in canada, multiple countries in europe, israel, japan, and other countries in asia. our foreign headquarters is located in dublin, ireland. our offices are further described under part i, item 2, properties . in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, an aggregate of 52%, 51% and 50%, respectively, of synopsys total revenue was derived from sales outside of the united states. additional information relating to domestic and foreign operations, including revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, is contained in note 12 of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii, item 8. financial statements and supplementary data and is included herein. synopsys backlog was approximately $2.4 billion on october 31, 2010, representing a 9% increase from backlog of $2.2 billion on october 31, 2009. this increase resulted primarily from the timing of large contract renewals and backlog acquired from the various acquisitions which occurred in fiscal 2010, and to a lesser extent, by the strength of the japanese yen in fiscal 2010. backlog represents committed orders that are expected to be recognized as revenue over the following three years. backlog may not be a reliable predictor of our future sales as business conditions may change and technologies may evolve, and customers may seek to renegotiate their arrangements or default on their payment obligations. for this and other reasons, we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog when anticipated. the following table summarizes the revenue attributable to our four common groupings, or platforms, established for management reporting purposes as a percentage of total revenue for the last three fiscal years. fiscal years 2010 2009 2008 core eda 71 % 74 % 75 % intellectual property and system-level solutions 13 % 10 % 8 % manufacturing solutions 12 % 12 % 12 % professional services and other 4 % 4 % 5 % consolidated 100 % 100 % 100 % revenue derived from intel corporation and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for 10.9%, 10.8%, and 10.8% of our total revenue in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. 6 table of contents research and development our future performance depends in large part on our ability to further enhance and integrate our design and verification platforms and to expand our manufacturing, ip and system-level product offerings. research and development on existing and new products is primarily conducted within each product group. we also use targeted acquisitions to augment our own research and development efforts. our research and development expenses were $449.2 million, $419.9 million and $394.7 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. our capitalized software development costs were approximately $2.9 million, $3.0 million and $3.0 million in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. competition the eda industry is highly competitive. we compete against other eda vendors and against our customers own design tools and internal design capabilities. in general, we compete principally on technology leadership, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability with our own and other vendors products, price and payment terms. our competitors include eda vendors that offer varying ranges of products and services, primarily cadence design systems, inc., mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation, inc. we also compete with other eda vendors, including frequent new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, as well as with customers internally developed design tools and capabilities. in the ip area, we compete primarily with our customers internally developed ip. no one factor drives an eda customer buying decision, and we compete on all fronts to capture a higher portion of our customers budgets. product sales and licensing agreements we typically license our software to customers under non-exclusive license agreements that transfer title to the media only and restrict use of our software to specified purposes within specified geographical areas. the majority of our licenses are network licenses that allow a number of individual users to access the software on a defined network, including, in some cases, regional or global networks. license fees depend on the type of license, product mix and number of copies of each product licensed. in many cases, we provide our customers the right to re-mix a portion of the software they initially licensed for other specified synopsys products. for example, a customer may use our front-end design products for a portion of the license term and then exchange such products for back-end place and route software for the remainder of the term in order to complete the customer ic design. this practice helps assure the customer access to the complete design flow needed to design its product. the ability to offer this right to customers often gives us an advantage over competitors who offer a narrower range of products, because customers can obtain more of their design flow from a single vendor. at the same time, because in such cases the customer need not obtain a new license and pay an additional license fee for the use of the additional products, the use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual products separately without re-mix rights. we currently offer our software products under various license types: renewable tsls, term licenses and perpetual licenses. for a full discussion of these licenses, see part ii, item 7. management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations revenue background . 7 table of contents we typically license our designware core intellectual property products under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications. fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus, in some cases, royalties. finally, our global technical services team typically provides design consulting services to our customers under consulting agreements with statements of work specific to each project. proprietary rights synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. we have a diversified portfolio of more than 1,200 patents issued. our issued patents have expiration dates through 2030. our patents primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work. however, third parties may develop similar technology independently. in addition, effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future. we are not significantly dependent upon any single patent, copyright, trademark or license with respect to our proprietary rights. in many cases, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we offer to indemnify our customers if the licensed products infringe on a third party intellectual property rights. as a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. for example, we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it. employees as of october 31, 2010, synopsys had 6,707 employees, of which 3,063 were based in the united states. acquisitions in fiscal 2010 for information about acquisitions we completed during fiscal 2010, see note 3 of notes to

risk factors we describe our risk factors below. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers products and due to constraints in our customers budgets for research and development and eda products and services; 9 table of contents product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle; cancellations or changes to levels of license orders or the mix between upfront and time-based license revenue; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront revenue; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers for a large portion of our revenue; changes in or challenges to our revenue recognition model; amendments or renewals of customer contracts which provide discounts or require the deferral of revenue to later periods; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue and earnings and cause our stock price to decline. the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the eda industry as a whole, and our business in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics, and customers concerns about managing costs, have in recent periods led to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process. if these trends continue, demand for our products and services could fall and our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. additionally, as the eda industry matures, industry consolidation has caused increased levels of competition for a greater share of our customers eda spending. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisitions of coware, inc., vast systems technology corporation, and virage logic corporation, to increase revenue and expand our product offerings, and we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future. achieving the potential financial or 10 table of contents technological benefits from these transactions is difficult and time consuming, and the integration of these acquisitions poses a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related unanticipated expenses and diversion of resources; potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; and negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of asc 805, business combinations , which became applicable to us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. if we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. for instance, if we are unable to successfully integrate the products and technology from our recent acquisition of virage logic, we may not be able achieve the anticipated revenue growth from this transaction. additionally, if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology, we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets, which would harm our operating results. the continued uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. as a result of the recent major global recession, the global economy continues to experience significant uncertainty, stock market volatility, tightened credit markets, concerns about both deflation and inflation, reduced demand for products, lower consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, liquidity concerns and business insolvencies. these declines, and uncertainty about future economic conditions, could continue to negatively impact our customers businesses, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business. the recent global recession adversely affected the semiconductor industry. semiconductor companies generally remain cautious and focused on their costs, including in their research and development budgets out of which spending on eda products and services occurs. these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. under our business model, we generally expect more than 90% of our total revenue to be recurring revenue, as a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a three-year period. however, the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions have caused some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. continued periods of decreased committed average annual revenue, additional customer bankruptcies, or consolidation among our customers, could adversely affect our year-over-year revenue growth. 11 table of contents the recent global recession also adversely affected the banking and financial industry. if the global economy continues to experience uncertainty, our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms could be jeopardized. furthermore, we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts, provide credit and provide banking transactions and deposit services worldwide. should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations, it could adversely affect our financial results and our business. we cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of the global economic downturn or any subsequent recovery, so our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. if economic conditions further deteriorate or fail to significantly improve for any extended period of time, or, in particular, if semiconductor industry revenues do not grow, our future revenues and financial results will be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. if we do not successfully compete in the eda industry our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, primarily cadence design systems, inc., mentor graphics corporation and magma design automation, inc. we also compete with other eda vendors, including frequent new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products. the demand for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers products, design starts and our customers budgetary constraints. in addition, our customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their eda purchases with one vendor. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offering through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms which continue to lengthen over time. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, or if we fail to address new competitive forces, our business will be harmed. consolidation in the eda industry may negatively impact our operating results. the eda industry in recent years has been subject to increased consolidation. we expect this trend to continue as companies within the industry attempt to increase or maintain market share by complimenting or expanding product offerings, or as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. industry consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies that are better 12 table of contents able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. this could lead to fewer customers or the loss of one or more major customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. changes in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. gaap. these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. a change in these principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. additionally, proposed accounting standards could have a significant impact on our operational processes, revenues and expenses, and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and make comparability between periods less meaningful. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development. these investments may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. 13 table of contents unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, such as an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. currently, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states, and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the united states. united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-united states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. on may 5, 2009 and february 1, 2010, the president of the united states and the u.s. treasury department proposed changing certain u.s. tax rules for u.s. corporations doing business outside the united states. specific legislation has not yet been proposed or enacted, but it is possible that these or other changes in the u.s. tax laws could increase our u.s. income tax liability in the future. on august 10, 2010, the education jobs and medicaid assistance act of 2010 (p.l. 111-226) was enacted, which may limit our ability to use foreign tax credits on transactions we enter into after fiscal 2010. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the irs and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. examinations of our federal tax returns for the years 2000-2001 and 2002-2004 by the irs resulted in significant proposed adjustments which were subsequently settled. we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments and expiration of, or amendments to, foreign tax rulings could materially increase our effective tax rate. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations which may adversely affect our business. we derive approximately half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business; ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; 14 table of contents inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. our operating results are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. our results of operations can be adversely affected when the u.s. dollar weakens relative to other currencies, as a result of the translation of expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the u.s. dollar. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business, results of operations and financial condition. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk. if foreign currency exchange rates deteriorate our operating results would be adversely affected by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside of the united states. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights. under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party intellectual property rights. as a result, we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights. we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. we believe this claim to be without merit and are vigorously defending against it. however, there can be no assurances that we will prevail. these types of claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or 15 table of contents perception of our products. in addition, allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results. the majority of our revenue backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. a significant portion of the revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash from customers. we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed. moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses. our customers financial condition, and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations, could be adversely affected by current economic conditions. if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments, our operating results would be harmed. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure from stockholders, who must approve any increases in our equity pool, to limit the use of such equity-based compensation and its dilutive effect on stockholders. in addition, we are required under u.s. gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee share-based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan, which has increased the pressure to limit share-based compensation. these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive share-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. 16 table of contents our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq global market, and the financial accounting standards board. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, on july 21, 2010, congress passed the dodd-frank wall street reform and protection act. our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank act and other new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could have a material adverse impact on our business. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications, and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders. our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 39 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31, 2010: carrying value weighted average total

$25.0 million within five to ten years and $37.7 million after ten years. however, we consider these investments to be short-term in nature because, in accordance with our investment policy, the weighted average expected duration of our total invested funds does not exceed one year and the investments are available for short-term obligations and other uses including acquisitions. these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 39 table of

average interest rate 1.85 % 1.32 % 1.32 % foreign currency risk. we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary local currency, except for our principal irish, hungarian, and swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are the u.s. dollar. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 19 months. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2010, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $11.7 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $11.7 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $11.7 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. 40 table of contents net unrealized loss of approximately $6.4 million and gain of approximately $9.6 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2010 and october 31, 2009, respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides

associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the continued uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. as a result of the recent global recession, the global economy experienced significant uncertainty, stock market volatility, tightened credit markets, concerns about both deflation and inflation, reduced demand for products, lower consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, liquidity concerns and business insolvencies. further declines, and uncertainty about future economic conditions, could negatively impact our customers businesses, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business. the recent global recession adversely affected the semiconductor industry. semiconductor companies generally remain cautious and focused on their costs, including their research and development budgets which capture spending on eda products and services. these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. under our business model, we generally expect more than 90% of our total revenue to be recurring revenue, as a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a three-year period. however, the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions caused some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. future periods of decreased committed average annual revenue, customer bankruptcies, or consolidation among our customers, could adversely affect our year-over-year revenue growth. the recent global recession also adversely affected the banking and financial industry. if the global economy continues to experience uncertainty, our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms could be jeopardized. furthermore, we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts, provide credit and banking transactions and deposit services worldwide. should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations, it could adversely affect our financial results and our business. we cannot predict if or when global economic confidence will be restored. accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. if economic conditions fail to significantly improve for any extended period of time or deteriorate in the future, or, in particular, if semiconductor industry revenues do not continue to grow, our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the eda industry as a whole, and our business in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the semiconductor industry is currently anticipated to have modest growth in 2012. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics, and customers concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could 10 table of contents be adversely affected if the semiconductor and electronics industries do not continue to grow, or grow at a slower rate. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation has increased competition for a greater share of our customers eda spending. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years, including the acquisitions of coware, inc., vast systems technology corporation, and virage logic corporation. on november 30, 2011, we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, have agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of magma design automation, inc. (magma) in exchange for cash. our pending acquisition of magma carries certain risks, including our ability to obtain governmental approvals of the acquisition in a timely manner or at all, the risk that such approvals are not obtained and we must pay a break-up fee, risks related to class action lawsuits filed by purported magma stockholders that could be costly, time-consuming and affect our ability to close the transaction, and the risk that magma stockholders will not approve the acquisition. we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock, a substantial reduction of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management attention; potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; and negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of asc 805, business combinations . if we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. for instance, if, after the closing of our acquisition of magma, we are unable to successfully integrate magma products and technology, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated revenue growth from this transaction. the integration process may involve significant management time and create uncertainty for employees and customers, and delays in the process 11 table of contents could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. additionally, if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology, we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets, which would negatively impact our operating results. consolidation among our customers, as well as within the industries in which we operate, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. moreover, business combinations within the industries in which we compete may result in stronger competition from companies that are better able to compete as sole source vendors to customers. the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire business and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. changes in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. a change in existing principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. additionally, proposed accounting standards could have a significant impact on our operational processes, revenues and expenses, and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations. for example, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) is currently working together with the international accounting standards board (iasb) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow gaap and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards (ifrs). these efforts may result in different accounting principles under gaap, which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results in areas including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, lease accounting, and financial statement presentation. we expect the sec to make a determination in the near future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for u.s. companies. a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively adversely affect previously reported transactions. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers products and due to constraints in our customers budgets for research and development and eda products and services; 12 table of contents product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle; cancellations or changes to levels of license orders or the mix between upfront and time-based license revenue; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront revenue; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers for a large portion of our revenue; changes in or challenges to our revenue recognition model; amendments or renewals of customer contracts which provide discounts or require the deferral of revenue to later periods; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc., mentor graphics corporation and magma. we also compete with other eda vendors, including frequent new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, as well as vendors of ip products and system-level solutions. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers products, design starts and our customers budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. 13 table of contents we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offering through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. currently, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states, and a substantial portion of our assets, 14 table of contents including employees, are located outside the united states. united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-united states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the united states are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service (irs) and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. the irs examinations of our federal tax returns for the years 2000 through 2001 and 2002 through 2004 resulted in significant proposed adjustments which were subsequently settled without a material financial statement impact. in addition, we are currently being audited in jurisdictions outside the united states. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments, could materially increase our effective tax rate. furthermore, we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and certain state tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states, as well as sufficient taxable income in certain states. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations which may adversely affect our business. we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business; ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; 15 table of contents inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of october 31, 2011, approximately 77% of our worldwide cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balance was held in subsidiary accounts outside the united states. in addition, typically about half of our operating cash flow is received by our overseas subsidiaries. should our cash spending needs in the united states rise and exceed our existing u.s. balances, revolving credit facility and future u.s. cash flows, we may be required to incur debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure and/or the market price of our common stock. for example, we expect to partially fund our acquisition of magma using debt, which would require us to draw on our revolving credit facility or to incur additional debt separate from our credit facility. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. for example, in december 2011, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against us by dynetix design solutions, inc., which seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. further information regarding this lawsuit is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . in addition, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party intellectual property rights. we have recently defended some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company. although we were successful in that case, there can be no assurances that we will prevail in defending against any current or future claims of infringement. in addition, these types of claims can result in costly and time- 16 table of contents consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results. the majority of our revenue backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered. a significant portion of the revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash from customers. we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed. moreover, existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre-existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses. our customers financial condition, and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations, could be adversely affected by current economic conditions. if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments, our operating results would be harmed. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. in connection with our definitive agreement to acquire magma, purported magma stockholders filed shareholder class action lawsuits in december 2011 against magma, magma directors and synopsys. further information regarding these lawsuits is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has 17 table of contents increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. in addition, we are required under gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee share-based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan, which has increased the pressure to limit equity-based compensation. these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, congress recently passed the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank act and other new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by deterioration of the capital markets. our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of october 31, 2011 consists of investment grade municipal bonds, tax-exempt money market mutual funds, taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of current adverse financial market conditions, including the recent downgrade by standard and poor (s&amp;p) of the u.s. long-term sovereign credit rating, capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer credit quality or changes in interest rates. 18 table of contents security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and reputation. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. any such security breach could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 42 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short-term investment portfolio. the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk. to achieve this objective, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax-exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy. none of these investments are held for trading purposes. our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer and type of instrument. the following table presents the carrying value and related weighted average total return for our investment portfolio as of october 31, 2011: carrying value weighted average total return (in thousands) money market funds (u.s.) $ 55,267 0.020% cash deposits and money market funds (international) 649,812 0.196% short-term

1.16 % foreign currency risk. we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary local currency, except for our principal irish, hungarian, and swiss subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are the u.s. dollar. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2011, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $12.0 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $12.0 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $12.0 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized loss of approximately $12.8 million and $6.4 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2011 and october 31, 2010, respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. 43 table of contents the following table provides information about the gross notional

factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the continued uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. as a result of the recent global recession, the global economy experienced significant uncertainty, stock market volatility, tightened credit markets, concerns about both deflation and inflation, reduced demand for products, lower consumer confidence, reduced capital spending, liquidity concerns and business insolvencies. further declines, and uncertainty about future economic conditions, could negatively impact our customers businesses, reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business. the recent global recession adversely affected the semiconductor industry. semiconductor companies generally remain cautious and focused on their costs, including their research and development budgets which capture spending on eda products and services. these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. under our business model, we generally expect more than 90% of our total revenue to be recurring revenue, as a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a multi-year period. however, the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions caused some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments, our operating results would be harmed. furthermore, future periods of decreased committed average annual revenue, customer bankruptcies, or consolidation among our customers, could adversely affect our year-over-year revenue growth. the recent global recession also adversely affected the banking and financial industry. if the global economy continues to experience uncertainty, our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms could be jeopardized. furthermore, we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts, provide credit and banking transactions and deposit services worldwide. should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations, it could adversely affect our financial results and our business. we cannot predict if or when global economic confidence will be restored. accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. if economic conditions deteriorate in the future, or, in particular, if the semiconductor industry does not continue to grow, our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. 10 table of contents the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the eda industry as a whole, and our business in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics, and customers concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if the semiconductor and electronics industries do not continue to grow, or grow at a slower rate. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation has increased competition for a greater share of our customers eda spending. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries manufacturing processes or major ip providers products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years, including the recent acquisitions of magma design automation, inc. (magma), springsoft, inc. and emulation &amp; verification engineering s.a. (eve). we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock, a substantial reduction of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; 11 table of contents assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management attention; potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; and negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of asc 805, business combinations . if we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. for instance, if we are unable to successfully integrate magma products and technology, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated revenue growth from our magma acquisition. in addition, expenses associated with supporting magma products could result in less expense synergies than anticipated. the integration process may involve significant management time and create uncertainty for employees and customers, and delays in the process could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, expenses, operating results and financial condition. additionally, if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology, we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets, which would negatively impact our operating results. consolidation among our customers, as well as within the industries in which we operate, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. moreover, business combinations within the industries in which we compete may result in stronger competition from companies that are better able to compete as sole source vendors to customers. the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire business and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. changes in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. a change in existing principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. additionally, proposed accounting standards could have a significant impact on our operational processes, revenues and expenses, and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations. for example, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) is currently working together with the international accounting standards board (iasb) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards (ifrs). these efforts 12 table of contents may result in different accounting principles under gaap, which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results in areas including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, lease accounting, and financial statement presentation. the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for u.s. companies. a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs or to converged accounting principles may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively adversely affect previously reported transactions. our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers products and due to constraints in our customers budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; cancellations or changes to levels of license orders or the mix between upfront revenue and time-based license revenue; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront revenue; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers for a large portion of our revenue; changes in or challenges to our revenue recognition model; amendments or renewals of customer contracts which provide discounts or require the deferral of revenue to later periods; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation. we also compete with other eda vendors, including frequent new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more 13 table of contents discrete phases of the ic design process, as well as vendors of ip products and system-level solutions. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products. the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers products, design starts and our customers budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offering through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. 14 table of contents if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. unfavorable tax law changes, an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. currently, a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states, and a substantial portion of our assets, including employees, are located outside the united states. united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non-united states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the u.s. are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we have operations in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and foreign tax credits and certain state tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income, including foreign source income in the united states, as well as sufficient taxable income in certain states. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant, or even any, revenue. 15 table of contents the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations which may adversely affect our business. we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple, remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business; ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; government trade restrictions, including tariffs or other trade barriers; additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. as of december 7, 2012, we have outstanding debt of $135.0 million under our term loan facility, primarily as a result of funding our magma acquisition. most of our worldwide cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balance is held in subsidiary accounts outside the united states approximately 72% as of october 31, 2012. in addition, typically about half of our operating cash flow is received by our overseas subsidiaries. should our cash spending needs in the united states rise and exceed our existing u.s. balances, available credit under our revolving credit and term loan 16 table of contents facilities, and future u.s. cash flows, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure and/or the market price of our common stock. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. for example, in december 2011, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against us by dynetix design solutions, inc., which seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. we may also acquire companies that are party to existing infringement claims. for example, eve, a company we acquired in october 2012, is a party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation. further information regarding the dynetix and eve lawsuits is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . in addition, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding material pending lawsuits, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial 17 table of contents employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. in addition, we are required under gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee share-based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan, which has increased the pressure to limit equity-based compensation. these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, congress recently passed the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act. our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank act and other new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by deterioration of the capital markets. our cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio currently consists of tax-exempt money market mutual funds, taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits. our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk. fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of current adverse financial market conditions, capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. in addition, we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer credit quality or changes in interest rates. security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and reputation. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to 18 table of contents attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. any security breach of our own or a third party vendor systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the second quarter of fiscal 2012, we liquidated our municipal bond investment portfolio and incurred debt primarily to fund the magma acquisition. our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2012, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. the following tables present our cash equivalents, investments and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates. as of october 31, 2012 maturing in year ending october 31, 2013 2014 2015 2016 total fair value (in thousands) cash equivalent (variable rate) $ 533,221 $ $ $ $ 533,221 $ 533,221 average interest rate 0.39 % % % %

and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates. the functional currency of the majority of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2012, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately $9.3 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $9.3 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.3 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized loss of approximately $1.3 million and loss of approximately $12.8 million, net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2012 and october 31, 2011, respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. 42 table of contents we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides information

contents equity risk. our strategic investment portfolio consists of approximately $11.7 million and $4.0 million of non-marketable equity securities in privately held companies as of october 31, 2012 and october 31, 2011, respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. during fiscal 2012 and 2011, we wrote down the value of our strategic investment portfolio by $0.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively. none of our investments in our strategic investment portfolio are held for trading purposes. selected unaudited quarterly financial data the table below includes certain unaudited financial information for the last four fiscal

53-week year occurs, we include the additional week in the first quarter to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. the first quarter of fiscal 2012 was a 14-week quarter. all other quarters in fiscal 2012 and all quarters in fiscal 2011 were 13-week quarters. 44 table of contentsrisk factors 10 risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below. investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock. the continued uncertainty in the global economy, and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular, may negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. while the global economy is improving, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery. weakness in the global economy has adversely affected consumer confidence and the growth of the semiconductor industry in recent years, causing semiconductor companies to behave cautiously and focus on their costs, including their research and development budgets, which capture spending on eda products and services. for example, uncertainty caused by the global recession caused some of our customers to postpone their decision-making, decrease their spending and/or delay their payments to us. continuing caution by semiconductor companies could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. the global recession also impacted the banking and financial services industry, resulting in the downgrade of the credit ratings of many banks, including banks we rely on for foreign currency forward contracts, credit and banking transactions and deposit services worldwide. while recent legislation is designed to strengthen the banking industry, should any of our banking partners default on their obligations, it could adversely affect our financial results and our business. we cannot predict when widespread global economic confidence will be restored. events such as the timing and execution of the tapering of asset purchases by the u.s. federal reserve may continue to drive stock market and interest rate volatility, consumer confidence and product demand. accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty, and our stock price is at risk of volatile change. if economic conditions deteriorate in the future, or, in particular, if the semiconductor industry does not grow, our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected. conversely, in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers, the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model. the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries. the growth of the eda industry as a whole, and our business in particular, is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries. a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends 10 table of contents upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers. the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics, and customers concerns about managing costs, have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general, with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process or opting for less advanced, but less risky, manufacturing processes that may not require the most advanced eda products. demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if growth in the semiconductor and electronics industries slows or stalls. additionally, as the eda industry matures, consolidation may result in stronger competition from companies better able to compete as sole source vendors. this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins, which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. furthermore, the semiconductor and electronics industries have become increasingly complex ecosystems. many of our customers outsource the manufacture of their semiconductor designs to foundries. our customers also frequently incorporate third-party ip, whether provided by us or other vendors, into their designs to improve the efficiency of their design process. we work closely with major foundries to ensure that our eda, ip, and manufacturing solutions are compatible with their manufacturing processes. similarly, we work closely with other major providers of semiconductor ip, particularly microprocessor ip, to optimize our eda tools for use with their ip designs and to assure that their ip and our own ip products, which may each provide for the design of separate components on the same chip, work effectively together. if we fail to optimize our eda and ip solutions for use with major foundries manufacturing processes or major ip providers products, or if our access to such foundry processes or third-party ip products is hampered, then our solutions may become less desirable to our customers, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete, or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy. we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years. we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future, but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks, which could harm our operating results. acquisitions are difficult, time-consuming, and pose a number of risks, including: potential negative impact on our earnings per share; failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales; problems in integrating the acquired products with our products; difficulties entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced; potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses, increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products; difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees; substantial reductions of our cash resources and/or the incurrence of debt; failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings; dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock as part of the merger consideration; assumption of unknown liabilities, including tax and litigation, and the related expenses and diversion of resources; 11 table of contents disruption of ongoing business operations, including diversion of management attention and uncertainty for employees and customers, particularly during the post-acquisition integration process; potential negative impact on our relationships with customers, distributors and business partners; and negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of asc 805, business combinations . if we do not manage these risks, the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. additionally, if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology, we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets, which would negatively impact our operating results. consolidation among our customers, as well as within the industries in which we operate, may negatively impact our operating results. a number of business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships, among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently, and more could occur in the future. consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers, increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. moreover, business combinations within the industries in which we compete may result in stronger competition from companies that are better able to compete as sole source vendors to customers. the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition. in addition, we and our competitors from time to time acquire business and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings. if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer, they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio, a larger support and service capability, or lower prices, which could negatively impact our business and operating results. changes in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results. we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. a change in existing principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results. accounting standard changes could have a significant impact on our revenues and expenses, may require costly changes to our operational processes, and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations. for example, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) is currently working together with the international accounting standards board (iasb) to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies that are required to follow gaap and those that are required to follow international financial reporting standards (ifrs). these efforts may result in different accounting principles under gaap, which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results in areas including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, lease accounting, and financial statement presentation. the sec may make a determination in the future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for u.s. companies. a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs or to converged accounting principles may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively adversely affect previously reported transactions. 12 table of contents our operating results may fluctuate in the future, which may adversely affect our stock price. our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations, which may adversely affect our stock price. our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations. many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate, including: changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers products and due to constraints in our customers budgets for research and development and eda products and services; product competition in the eda industry, which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation; our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire; failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle, which often includes a substantial customer evaluation and approval process because of the complexity of our products and services; cancellations or changes to levels of license orders or the mix between upfront license revenue and time-based license revenue; the levels of our hardware revenues, which are recognized upfront and are primarily dependent upon our ability to provide the latest technology and meet customer requirements, and which can therefore increase variability in our recognized revenue; such variability in turn may impact our levels of excess and obsolete inventory expenses; our ability to implement effective cost control measures; delay of one or more orders for a particular period, particularly orders generating upfront license revenue; our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers, and on such customers continuing to renew licenses and purchase additional products from us, for a large portion of our revenue; changes in or challenges to our revenue recognition model; customer contract amendments or renewals that provide discounts or defer revenue to later periods; expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology; changes to our effective tax rate; delays, increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products; and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries. these factors, or any other factors or risks discussed herein, could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline. we operate in highly competitive industries, and if we do not continue to meet our customers demand for innovative technology at lower costs, our business and financial condition will be harmed. we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services, such as cadence design systems, inc. and mentor graphics corporation. we also compete with other eda vendors, including frequent new entrants to the marketplace, that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process, as well as vendors of ip products and system-level solutions. moreover, our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products. 13 table of contents the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors, including demand for our customers products, design starts and our customers budgetary constraints. technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements. semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease, substantially increasing the complexity, cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing. at the same time, our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design, which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor. in order to succeed in this environment, we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements and increase the value of our products, while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs. we compete principally on the basis of technology, product quality and features (including ease-of-use), license or usage terms, post-contract customer support, interoperability among products, and price and payment terms. specifically, we believe the following competitive factors affect our success: our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles and technological shifts, innovate rapidly and efficiently, improve our existing products, and successfully develop or acquire new products; our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance; our ability to enhance the value of our offerings through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage, future purchase rights, price discounts and other unique rights, such as multiple tool copies, post-contract customer support, re-mix rights that allow customers to exchange the software they initially licensed for other synopsys products, and the ability to purchase pools of technology; and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms. if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors, fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs, or fail to address new competitive forces, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected. if we fail to protect our proprietary technology, our business will be harmed. our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology. our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful. we rely on agreements with customers, employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology. these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. additionally, despite our measures to prevent piracy, other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products, which could result in lost revenue. some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to: assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property; defend our products from piracy; protect our trade secrets or know-how; or determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the propriety rights of others. if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent, copyright or trade secret protection, for any reason, or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions, our business and 14 table of contents operating results would be harmed. in addition, intellectual property litigation is lengthy, expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income. unfavorable tax law changes, changes in our forecasted or actual geographical earnings mix, or an unfavorable government review of our tax returns could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results. our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense. u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on undistributed earnings for certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries. a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the u.s. are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time. we have operations in the u.s. and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates. therefore, any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments, could materially impact our effective tax rate. furthermore, we maintain significant deferred tax assets related to federal research credits and foreign tax credits and certain state tax credits. our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future taxable income, including foreign source income in the u.s., as well as sufficient taxable income in certain states. changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings that could materially affect our financial results. the computation of our annual effective tax rate is complex as it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under u.s. gaap. income tax expense (benefit) for interim quarters is based on a forecast of our worldwide effective tax rate. this forecast includes forward looking financial projections by jurisdiction as well as a number of other estimates and assumptions. various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may be treated as discrete to the period in which they occur. for these reasons, our worldwide effective tax rate may be materially different than our forecast and fluctuate throughout the year. our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and, in the ordinary course of our business, there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. we are also liable for potential tax liabilities of businesses we acquire. although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated, which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results. we devote substantial resources to research and development. new competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our acquisitions, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a 15 table of contents corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results. finally, there can be no guarantee that our research and development investments will result in products that create significant, or even any, revenue. the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations that may adversely affect our business. we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states, and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the u.s. in addition, we have expanded our non-u.s. operations significantly in the past several years. this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees, manage multiple remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the u.s. our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks, including: ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights; international economic and political conditions, such as political tensions between countries in which we do business; difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business; financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions; government trade restrictions, including tariffs or other trade barriers; additional taxes and penalties; and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest, war and infectious diseases. if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations, our business and results of operations will be harmed. in addition, our global operations are subject to numerous u.s. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy and labor relations. these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines, penalties or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations. any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a weakening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into u.s. dollars in our consolidated statement of operations. likewise, a strengthening u.s. dollar relative to other currencies, especially the japanese yen, reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation. our revenue from japan has been affected by the devaluation of the yen in the past year and may continue to fluctuate should the yen experience significant further volatility. exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations, and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations. although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity, we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 16 table of contents liquidity requirements in our u.s. operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets, which could negatively affect our financial condition. more than half of our worldwide cash and cash equivalents balance is held by our international subsidiaries in their own accounts outside the united states approximately 54% as of october 31, 2013. at present, such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested abroad to the extent they derive from indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings. we have a credit agreement with several lenders providing for a $150 million term loan facility and a $350 million revolving credit facility, and as of october 31, 2013, we had outstanding debt of $105.0 million under our term loan facility, and no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility. should our cash spending needs in the u.s. rise and exceed our existing u.s. balances, available credit under our revolving credit and term loan facilities, and future u.s. cash flows, we may be required to incur additional debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources, which could negatively affect our results of operations, capital structure and the market price of our common stock. from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including patent rights. for example, in december 2011, a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against us by dynetix design solutions, inc., which seeks, among other things, compensatory damages and a permanent injunction. we may also acquire companies that are party to existing infringement claims. for example, eve, a company we acquired in october 2012, is a party to ongoing patent infringement lawsuits involving mentor graphics corporation. further information regarding the dynetix and eve lawsuits is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . in addition, under our customer agreements and other license agreements, we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party intellectual property rights. infringement claims can result in costly and time-consuming litigation, require us to enter into royalty arrangements, subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products, invalidate a patent or family of patents, require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products, any one of which could harm our business and operating results. product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share. software products frequently contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced, when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies. product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products, could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products. in addition, allegations of manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could, even if untrue, adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us. any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers, increase our service costs, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business. we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, employment, competition, and other issues on a global basis. litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or, in cases for which injunctive relief is sought, an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products. if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. further information regarding 17 table of contents material pending lawsuits, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, is contained in part i, item 3, legal proceedings . if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees, our business may be harmed. we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success. if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team, our business could be adversely affected. to be successful, we must also attract and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees, including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions. there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers, and competition for these individuals is intense and has increased. our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers. any failure to recruit and retain key technical, sales and managerial employees could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. additionally, efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses. we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation. we face pressure to limit the use of such equity-based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders. in addition, we are required under gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results of operations for employee share-based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan, which has increased the pressure to limit equity-based compensation. these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity-based packages in the future, which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees. our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price. we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the sec, the nasdaq stock market, and the fasb. these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. for example, our efforts to comply with the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and other new regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls and compliance programs. regardless of how well designed and operated it is, a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met. further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. moreover, although we have implemented compliance programs and compliance training for employees, such measures may not prevent our employees, contractors or agents from breaching or circumventing our policies or violating applicable laws and regulations. failure of our control systems and compliance programs to prevent error, fraud or violations of law could have a material adverse impact on our business. our investment portfolio may be impaired by the deterioration of capital markets. our cash equivalent portfolio currently consists of tax-exempt money market mutual funds, taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits. in general, our investment portfolio may carry both 18 table of contents interest rate risk and credit risk. we may hold fixed rate debt securities that can have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates, or floating rate securities that may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs. as a result of current adverse financial market conditions, capital pressures on certain banks, especially in europe, and the continuing low interest rate environment, some of our financial instruments may become impaired. further, while the u.s. government has raised the federal debt ceiling to allow it to borrow funds through february 7, 2014, if the debt ceiling is not raised beyond that date, the u.s. government may default, which could impact the liquidity of our investment funds. our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of investments held by us is judged to be other-than-temporary. security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and reputation. we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and confidential employee information, in our data centers and on our networks. despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information. because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats. any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business. in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements, which, if not accurate, may significantly impact our financial results. we make assumptions, judgments and estimates for a number of items, including the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill, long-lived assets and other intangible assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets, the recognition of revenue and the fair value of stock awards. we also make assumptions, judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee-related liabilities, including commissions and variable compensation, and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions, allowances for doubtful accounts, and legal contingencies. these assumptions, judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. actual results could differ materially from our estimates, and such differences could significantly impact our financial results. catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results. due to the global nature of our business, our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world. we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications, enterprise applications and technology systems for our development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake, fire, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders. moreover, our corporate headquarters, a significant 19 table of contents portion of our research and development activities, our data centers, and certain other critical business operations are located in california, near major earthquake faults. a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our operating results would be adversely affected. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 40 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash and cash equivalents and outstanding debt. as of october 31, 2013, all of our cash, cash equivalents and debt were at short-term variable interest rates. while par value generally approximates fair value on variable instruments, rising interest rates over time would increase both our interest income and our interest expense. 40 table of contents the following tables present our cash equivalents and debt by fiscal year of expected maturity and average interest rates: as of october 31, 2013 maturing in year ending october 31, 2014 2015 2016 total fair value (in thousands) cash equivalent

active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary local currency. we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non-functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including: (1) certain assets and liabilities, (2) shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month, (3) future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders, and (4) certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies. the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below. the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to 21 months. a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note 2 and note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements. the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. to the extent our estimates are correct, gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions. for example, if the euro were to depreciate by 10% compared to the u.s. dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october 31, 2013, the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately 41 table of contents $9.2 million, and we would be required to pay approximately $9.2 million to the counterparty upon contract maturity. at the same time, the u.s. dollar value of our euro-based expenses would decline, resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately $9.2 million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts. net unrealized losses of approximately $1.8 million and $1.3 million, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated balance sheets as of october 31, 2013 and october 31, 2012, respectively. if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate, we will not be completely hedged, and we will record a gain or loss, depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy. we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes. we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties. further, we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements. the following table provides information about the gross notional values of our foreign currency contracts as of october 31, 2013: gross notional amount in u.s. dollars average contract

october 31, 2012, respectively. these investments are accounted for under the cost or equity methods. the cost basis of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. the securities of privately held companies are reported at carrying value. investments are written down to the fair value if there are any events or changes in circumstances that indicate any other than temporary decline in the value. during fiscal 2013, we did not write down the value of our investment portfolio and during fiscal 2012, we wrote down our investment portfolio by $0.5 million. none of our investments are held for speculation purposes. 43 table of contents selected unaudited quarterly financial data the table below includes certain unaudited financial information for the last four
