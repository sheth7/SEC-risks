instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues translated into u.s. dollars. approximately 92% of coach fiscal 2003 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states. these countries include china, costa rica, italy, india, indonesia, malaysia, spain, turkey, thailand, taiwan, korea, hungary, singapore, great britain and the dominican republic. additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. substantially all purchases and

foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, to manage these risks. these transactions are in accordance with company risk management policies. coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. prior to the formation of coach japan, the company had not used foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge forecasted inventory purchases. in addition, the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to the euro-denominated expenses of its italian sourcing office. during the third quarter of fiscal 2003, the company began a program to enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, in order to manage these fluctuations. the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 12 months. the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in accrued liabilities at june 28,

2002, respectively. for fiscal 2003, open foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges with a notional amount of $33.2 million were fair valued and resulted in a pretax non cash benefit to earnings of $3.4 million. at june 29, 2002, open foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedges with a notional amount of $33.2 million were fair valued and resulted in a pretax non cash charge to earnings of $3.3 million. the fair value adjustment is included as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. also, as of june 28, 2003, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $39.3 million were fair valued resulting in an increase to equity as a benefit to other comprehensive income of $0.2 million, net of taxes.

$30.0 million at june 28, 2003. of this amount $26.5 million, under revolving credit facilities, is subject to interest rate fluctuations. a hypothetical 1% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach. 32 table of contentsquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 quantitative and qualitative

carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see &lsquo;&lsquo;special note on forward-looking information&rsquo;&rsquo; at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors include private label retailers, including some of coach&rsquo;s wholesale customers, as well as other well known handbags and accessories companies. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 25% of our net sales coming from operations outside the u.s. however, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company&rsquo;s exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: &bull; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products and result in decreased international consumer demand or increase our supply costs in those markets, &bull; political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, and &bull; changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through foreign currency hedging of coach japan&rsquo;s u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements. a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business. many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer 10 table of contents purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach&rsquo;s sales. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: &bull; availability of raw materials, &bull; compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, &bull; disruptions or delays in shipments, &bull; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, &bull; product quality issues, &bull; political unrest, &bull; as well as natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business. our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. in addition, because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers&rsquo; orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. however, over the past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. we expect that these trends will continue. provisions in coach&rsquo;s charter and bylaws, maryland law or its &lsquo;&lsquo;poison pill&rsquo;&rsquo; may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach&rsquo;s charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach&rsquo;s board of directors. coach&rsquo;s charter permits its board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach&rsquo;s board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach&rsquo;s board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach&rsquo;s common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach&rsquo;s stockholders. on may 3, 2001 coach declared a &lsquo;&lsquo;poison pill&rsquo;&rsquo; dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach&rsquo;s common stock. subject to limited 11 table of contents exceptions, these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or more of coach&rsquo;s common stock or announces a tender offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors. in this event, each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach&rsquo;s common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the then-current market price. subject to certain exceptions, coach&rsquo;s board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of coach&rsquo;s board of directors becomes aware that, a person has acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. as of the end of fiscal 2006, there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights plan. coach&rsquo;s bylaws can only be amended by coach&rsquo;s board of directors. coach&rsquo;s bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach&rsquo;s board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach&rsquo;s board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach&rsquo;s bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach&rsquo;s common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach&rsquo;s board of directors. coach&rsquo;s board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 30 &ndash; quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when 30 table of contents appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan. the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity&rsquo;s functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. substantially all of coach&rsquo;s fiscal 2006 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states. these countries include china, hungary, india, italy, korea, philippines, singapore, spain, taiwan, thailand and turkey. additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding coach japan, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, are not hedged by coach using any derivative instruments. coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. coach japan, enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, to manage these risks. these transactions are in accordance with coach&rsquo;s risk management policies. coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its $231 million u.s. dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach. to manage this risk, on july 1, 2005, coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a u.s. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. the loan matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and u.s. dollar based principals. the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 18 months. the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 1, 2006 and july 2, 2005 were $2.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. as of july 1, 2006 and july 2, 2005, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $114.8 million and $46.9 million were fair valued. for the year ended july 1, 2006, changes in derivative balances resulted in a reduction of other comprehensive income of $4.5 million, net of taxes. for the year ended july 2, 2005, changes in derivative balances resulted in an increase of other comprehensive income of $1.2 million, net of taxes. interest rate coach faces minimal interest rate risk exposure in relation to its outstanding debt of $3.3 million at july 1, 2006. a hypothetical 1% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach.risk factors 11 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china, europe and other international markets, and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in south america. in addition, we have taken control of certain of our retail operations in europe and the asia-pacific region, including the united kingdom, spain, ireland, portugal, france and germany during calendar 2013, and malaysia and south korea during calendar year 2012. we do not yet have significant experience directly operating in these countries, and in many of them we face established competitors. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront short-term investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. consequently, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. the successful execution of our multi-year transformation initiatives is key to the long-term growth of our business. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we announced a multi-year strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth, which will enable the company to return to best-in-class' profitability. key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan include: (i) the future investment of approximately $500 million in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations; (ii) the optimization of our north american store fleet including the closure of approximately 70 underperforming locations, (iii) the realignment of inventory levels to reflect our elevated product strategy; (iv) the investment of approximately $50 million in incremental advertising costs to further promote our new strategy; and (v) the significant scale-back of our promotional cadence, particularly within our outlet internet sales site. the company believes that long-term growth can be realized through its transformational efforts over time. however, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving long-term growth or changing the perception of coach from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand. refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 3, "transformation, restructuring and other related actions," for further information regarding the transformation plan. if the execution of our transformation plan falls short, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. 11 table of contents our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brand. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of coach's wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. we believe that the coach brand, established almost 75 years ago, is regarded as america's preeminent designer, producer, and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design, our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics, our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service. any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brand with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing and retail environments that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. even if our products do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 34 % of our net sales coming from operations outside of north america. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company's exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates, compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials, political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, the repatriation of foreign cash, natural and other disasters, and changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure. in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our subsidiaries' u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in japan and canada, as well as coach's cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries' foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. 12 table of contents our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance. our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that, from time to time, it may be helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. if, and when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party's rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as u.s. laws. computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. in addition, we maintain e-commerce sites in the u.s., canada, japan and china and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. additionally, coach has informational websites in various countries, as described in item i, "business." lastly, our e-commerce programs also include an invitation-only coach outlet flash sale site. given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (ii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our 13 table of contents current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer viruses or power outages. any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of, or significant fluctuations, in the cost of raw materials, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports, increases in the cost of labor, fuel, travel and transportation, compliance with our global business integrity program, compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company's products, disruptions or delays in shipments, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company's cost-effective sourcing model, product quality issues, political unrest, natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, and acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier selection guidelines, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website, www.coach.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, owned and operated by coach. to support our growth in china and europe, we established distribution centers in shanghai, china and oldenzaal, the netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, china, hong kong, singapore, taiwan, malaysia and south korea. the warehousing of coach merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center's operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. 14 table of contents we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. if we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. we do not own any of our retail store locations. we lease our corporate-owned stores under long-term, non-cancelable leases, which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years, with renewal options typically in five year increments. we believe that the leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancelable and have similar renewal options. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. if we determine that it is no longer economic to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. for example, in the fourth quarter of fy14, we announced that we will close approximately 70 retail stores in north america. in some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. in addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel. the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by: our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. our recently announced transformation plan and its attendant changes regarding organizational efficiencies may intensify this risk. we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. in recent years, we have experienced turnover of several senior management roles and we have focused time and resources on recruiting or promoting from within the new members of our current senior management team. the continued turnover of senior management or the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel. our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our wholesale business, primarily consisting of the u.s. wholesale business, comprised approximately 5% of total net sales for fiscal 2014 . continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees' products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. we currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for our footwear, eyewear, watches and fragrance products. see item 1 business products where discussed further. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner's ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. 15 table of contents our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. poor sales in coach's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the credit and capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives. we have maintained and accessed revolving credit facilities as a source of liquidity, along with cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, our non-current investments, and other available financing options. we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity. to date, we have not accessed the capital markets in a meaningful way, and therefore are not currently rated by credit rating agencies. our ability to access the capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon capital market conditions and our assigned credit rating and outlook. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. we could experience cost overruns and disruptions to our operations in connection with the construction of, and relocation to, our new global corporate headquarters. the company has entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company's new global corporate headquarters in a new office building to be located at the hudson yards development site in new york city. the financing, development and construction of the new building is taking place through a joint venture between the company and the developers. construction of the new building has commenced and occupancy in the new global headquarters is currently expected to take place in fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2014, the company invested $87.2 million in the hudson yards joint venture. the company expects to invest approximately $350 million in the joint venture over the next two years, with approximately $240 million estimated in fiscal 2015, depending on construction progress. outside of the joint venture, the company is directly investing in aspects of the new corporate headquarters. in fiscal 2014, $2.1 million was included in capital expenditures and we expect $188 million of additional expenditures over the remaining period of construction. the company's allocable share of the joint venture investments and capital expenditures will be financed by the company with cash on hand, debt-related borrowings and approximately $130 million of proceeds from the sale of its current headquarters buildings. due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature, together with the fact that we are in the early stages of construction of the project, certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete the project. in addition, the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations. thus, that process could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we cannot give any assurance that our developer will complete its obligations in a timely manner or at all or how changes in the overall development of the hudson yards project may impact the development of, or value of, the building in which our new global headquarters will be located. further, our developer has financing, construction and development obligations to parties other than us, and we cannot give any assurance as to how those obligations may impact the development of the project. 16 table of contents the ownership of real property, such as the new global corporate headquarters, also subjects us to various other risks, including, among others: - the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with correcting any environmental problems; - the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the new building as a result of fire, floods, or other natural disasters; and - adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors. provisions in coach's charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach's charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach's board. coach's charter permits its board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach's board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach's board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach's stockholders. coach's bylaws can only be amended by coach's board. coach's bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach's board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach's board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach's bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach's common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach's board. risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts ( hdrs ) an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly. we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange can develop or be sustained. if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained, the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected. as a result, the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach's common stock on the nyse, even allowing for currency differences. the characteristics of the u.s. capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different. the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different levels of retail and institutional participation). as a result of these differences, the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same, even allowing for currency differences. fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances peculiar to the u.s. capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs. because of the different characteristics of the u.s. and hong kong equity markets, the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by u.s. federal and maryland state laws and regulations. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange. our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations. u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong. there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong. we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong (the sfc ) that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence, these codes will not apply to us. we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong. in addition, we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules. neither our stockholders 17 table of contents nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules, regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied, and been granted, waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc. additionally, if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our non-compliance with applicable undertakings for any reason, additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming, and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance, which could adversely affect us and hdr holders. as the sfc does not have extra-territorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement, it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states. investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates. furthermore, prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware, among other things, that there are u.s. federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders. hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs (the hdr depositary ) to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company. hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders. they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs (the deposit agreement ). holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders' meetings, and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary. there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs, or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote, although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote. as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs, holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary (or its nominee) to exercise rights on their behalf. in addition, holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs. holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them. if we decide to undertake an equity offering (that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders), hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock, as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering. holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers. any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs. an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers, including but not limited to the hdr depositary, the registrar for the hdrs, the custodian and any sub-custodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock. a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations, whether or not by culpable default, could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment. coach will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian, any sub-custodian or the registrar; hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited. however, coach and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary. withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs. our common stock is presently traded on the nyse. any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse. upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock, the relevant hdrs will be cancelled. in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled, the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected. the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock (and vice versa) might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period. there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded. in addition, the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa). investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay. in addition, there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate. 18 table of contents investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and u.s. dollars. the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar/hong kong dollar exchange rate. while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the u.s. dollar using a specified trading band, no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows, arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach's risk management policies, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. substantially all of coach's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its foreign operating subsidiaries' u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. to mitigate such risk, coach japan and coach canada enter into foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options. as of june 28, 2014 and june 29, 2013 , zero-cost collar options designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of $90.3 million and $193.4 million , respectively, were outstanding. as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions. the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 28, 2014. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany and related party loans which are not long term in investment nature. this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the hong kong dollar, the south korean won, the new taiwan dollar, and the british pound sterling. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company entered into forward exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, the terms of which include the exchange of foreign currency fixed interest for u.s. dollar fixed interest and an exchange of the foreign currency and u.s. dollar based notional values at the maturity dates of the contracts, the latest of which is november 2014. as of june 28, 2014 and june 29, 2013 , the total notional values of outstanding forward exchange and cross-currency swap contracts related to these loans were $13.2 million and $147.6 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 28, 2014 and june 29, 2013 was $0.5 million and $4.5 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at june 28, 2014 and june 29, 2013 was $0.9 million and $2.9 million , respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss. as of june 28, 2014 , a 10% devaluation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values. interest rate risk coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments and revolving credit facilities. the company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company's investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes.risk factors 11 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the successful execution of our multi-year transformation initiatives is key to the long-term growth of our business. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we announced a multi-year strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth, which will enable the company to return to best-in-class' profitability. key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan include: (i) the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement; (ii) the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america, and select international stores, (iii) the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences; (iv) the investment in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our brand, drive sales growth and promote our new strategy; and (v) the significant scale-back of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment, particularly within our outlet internet sales site. the company believes that long-term growth can be realized through its transformational efforts over time. there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving long-term growth or changing the perception of the company from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand. furthermore, actual costs incurred under the transformation plan may differ from expectations based on our execution of the key operational and cost elements described above. refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 3, "transformation and other actions," for further information regarding the transformation plan. if the execution of our transformation plan falls short, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach and stuart weitzman stores in mainland china, europe and other international markets, both directly and through strategic partners. our brands may not be well-established or widely sold in some of these markets, and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there. in addition, many of these markets have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront short-term investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. consequently, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 39 % of our net sales coming from operations outside of north america. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company's exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates; political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets; 11 compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials; changes in tourist shopping patterns, particularly that of the chinese consumer; natural and other disasters; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls; and the repatriation of foreign cash. economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the company's products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brands. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is likely such cost will fluctuate significantly if oil prices remain volatile. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of the company's wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations; the acquired stuart weitzman business may underperform relative to our expectations; and the stuart weitzman acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community. during fiscal 2015, we acquired stuart weitzman holdings, llc, a leading designer and manufacturer of women's luxury footwear. we may have difficulty integrating the stuart weitzman business into our operations or otherwise successfully managing the expansion of the stuart weitzman business. additionally, while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms or at all. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business, such as stuart weitzman, and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things: 12 failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets; delays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets; higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or synergies and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties; difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations; diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations; unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business; consumers' failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees; assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; the impact on our or an acquired business' internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; and other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, including stuart weitzman, and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. we are required at least annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to determine if impairment has occurred. if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the period the determination is made. we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013; however, we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers, employees and lawmakers is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats, or to comply with state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our 13 intellectual property. lastly, we could face sizable fines, significant breach-notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. in addition, we maintain e-commerce sites in the u.s., canada, japan and china and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. additionally, coach has informational websites in various countries, as described in item i, "business." lastly, our e-commerce programs also include an invitation-only coach outlet flash sale site. given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer viruses or power outages. any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and the stuart weitzman brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. we believe that the coach brand, established almost 75 years ago, is regarded as america's preeminent designer, producer, and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design, our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics, our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service. furthermore, the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of women's luxury footwear within north america, with a strong opportunity for growth globally, and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifully-constructed shoe, merging fashion and function. any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our transformation plan. even if our products, marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure. in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our subsidiaries' u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in japan and canada, as well as the company's cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries' foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. sales to our international wholesale customers are primarily denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result of operating retail stores outside of the u.s., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar could impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the u.s. in addition, our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices. our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance, including our ability to return value to investors. our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock 14 price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends. investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors' expectations. see if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend. failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party's rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as u.s. laws. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of, or significant fluctuations, in the cost of raw materials; compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations; imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; increases in the cost of labor, fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation; compliance with our global business integrity program; compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our global operating principles and/or supplier selection guidelines, as applicable; compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company's products; disruptions or delays in shipments; loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites; inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company's cost-effective sourcing model; product quality issues; political unrest; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases; natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; and acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. in addition, we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier selection guidelines; however, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are available through our website, www.coach.com. the 15 violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers. if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, operated by coach. to support our growth in mainland china and europe, we established distribution centers in shanghai, china and oldenzaal, the netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, mainland china, hong kong, singapore, taiwan, malaysia, the united states and south korea. the warehousing of the company's merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center's operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations. we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. if we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. we do not own any of our retail store locations. we lease our corporate-owned stores under long-term, non-cancelable leases, which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years, with renewal options typically in five year increments. we believe that the leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancelable and have similar renewal options. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. in some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. in addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel. the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by: our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. our transformation plan and its attendant changes regarding organizational efficiencies may intensify this risk. we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. in recent years, we have experienced turnover of several senior management roles and we have focused time and resources on recruiting or promoting from within the new members of our current senior management team. the continued turnover of senior management or the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel. our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our north american wholesale business, primarily consisting of the u.s. wholesale business, comprised approximately 5% of total net sales for fiscal 2015 . continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees' products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. 16 we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. we currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for our footwear, eyewear, watches and fragrance products. see item 1 - business - products for additional discussion of our licensing arrangements. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner's ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. as we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions. as part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. poor sales in coach's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the credit and capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives. we have maintained and accessed revolving credit facilities and issued debt securities as a source of liquidity, along with cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, our non-current investments, and other available financing options. we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. 17 we could experience cost overruns and disruptions to our operations in connection with the construction of, and relocation to, our new global corporate headquarters. the company has entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company's new global corporate headquarters in a new office building to be located at the hudson yards development site in new york city. the financing, development and construction of the new building is taking place through a joint venture between the company and the developers. construction of the new building has commenced and occupancy in the new global headquarters is currently expected to take place in fiscal 2016. during fiscal 2015, the company invested $139.1 million in the hudson yards joint venture, resulting in a total equity method investment of 320.2 million as of june 27, 2015. the company expects to invest approximately $210 million in the joint venture over the next two years, with approximately $195 million estimated in fiscal 2016, depending on construction progress. outside of the joint venture, the company is directly investing in aspects of the new corporate headquarters. the company has incurred $34.0 million of capital expenditures to date, including $5.9 million in fiscal 2015, and we expect approximately $185 million of additional expenditures over the remaining period of construction. the company's allocable share of the joint venture investments and capital expenditures will be financed by the company with cash on hand, debt-related borrowings and approximately $130 million of proceeds from the sale of its current headquarters buildings. due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature, certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete the project. in addition, the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations. thus, that process could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we cannot give any assurance that our developer will complete its obligations in a timely manner or at all or how changes in the overall development of the hudson yards project may impact the development of, or value of, the building in which our new global headquarters will be located. further, our developer has financing, construction and development obligations to parties other than us, and we cannot give any assurance as to how those obligations may impact the development of the project. the ownership of real property, such as the new global corporate headquarters, also subjects us to various other risks, including, among others: the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with correcting any environmental problems; the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the new building as a result of fire, floods, or other natural disasters; and adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors. provisions in the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party. the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board. the company's charter permits its board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue. in addition, the company's board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although the company's board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the company's stockholders. the company's bylaws can only be amended by our board. the company's bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to the company's board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by the company's board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the company's bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between the company and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the company's common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by the company's board. risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts ( hdrs ) an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly. 18 we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange will develop or be sustained. if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained, the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected. as a result, the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach's common stock on the nyse, even allowing for currency differences. the characteristics of the u.s. capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different. the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different levels of retail and institutional participation). as a result of these differences, the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same, even allowing for currency differences. fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances particular to the u.s. capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs. because of the different characteristics of the u.s. and hong kong equity markets, the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by u.s. federal and maryland state laws and regulations. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange. our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations. u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong. there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong. we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong (the sfc ) that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence, these codes will not apply to us. we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong. in addition, we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules. neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules, regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied, and been granted, waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc. additionally, if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our non-compliance with applicable undertakings for any reason, additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming, and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance, which could adversely affect us and hdr holders. as the sfc does not have extra-territorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement, it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states. investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates. furthermore, prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware, among other things, that there are u.s. federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders. hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs (the hdr depositary ) to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company. hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders. they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs (the deposit agreement ). holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders' meetings, and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary. there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs, or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote, although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote. as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs, holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary (or its nominee) to exercise rights on their behalf. in addition, holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs. holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them. if we decide to undertake an equity offering (that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders), hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock, as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering. 19 holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers. any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs. an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers, including but not limited to the hdr depositary, the registrar for the hdrs, the custodian and any sub-custodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock. a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations, whether or not by culpable default, could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment. the company will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian, any sub-custodian or the registrar; hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited. however, the company and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary. withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs. our common stock is presently traded on the nyse. any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse. upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock, the relevant hdrs will be cancelled. in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled, the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected. the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock (and vice versa) might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period. there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded. in addition, the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa). investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay. in addition, there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate. investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and u.s. dollars. the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar/hong kong dollar exchange rate. while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the u.s. dollar using a specified trading band, no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 48 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows, arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the company's risk management policies, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, our foreign currency exchange risk is limited. the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries' u.s. dollar and euro denominated inventory purchases. to mitigate such risk, coach japan and coach canada enter into foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options and forward foreign currency contracts. as of june 27, 2015 and june 28, 2014 , zero-cost collar options and forward foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of $126.7 million and $90.2 million , respectively, were outstanding. as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions. the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 27, 2015 . the company is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany loans which are not long term in investment nature. this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the singapore dollar, the euro, the british pound sterling, the new taiwan dollar and the malaysian ringgit. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company primarily enters into forward exchange and cross-currency swap contracts. as of june 27, 2015 and june 28, 2014 , the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange and cross-currency swap contracts related to these loans were $25.8 million and $13.2 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 27, 2015 and june 28, 2014 was $3.4 million and $0.5 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at june 27, 2015 and june 28, 2014 was $0.2 million and $0.9 million , respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss. as of june 27, 2015 , a 10% devaluation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values. interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its amended and restated credit agreement, including the term loan, the 4.250% senior notes and investments. our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement, including the term loan. borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at coach's option, either (a) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus an applicable margin or (b) an alternate base rate (which is a rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of 1% or (iii) the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%). a hypothetical 10% change in the amended and restated credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an insignificant change in interest expense in fiscal 2015. furthermore, we are also exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of our $600.0 million 4.250% senior notes. at june 27, 2015 , the fair value of the 4.250% senior notes was approximately $579.0 million . the company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company's investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective 48 of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes.risk factors 12 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the successful execution of our multi-year transformation and operational efficiency initiatives is key to the long-term growth of our business. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we announced a multi-year strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth, which will enable the company to return to best-in-class' profitability. key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan included: (i) the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement; (ii) the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america, and select international stores, (iii) the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences; (iv) the investment in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our coach brand, drive sales growth and promote our new strategy; and (v) the significant scale-back of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment, particularly within our outlet internet sales site. the company's execution of these key operational and cost measures was concluded during fiscal 2016. the company believes that long-term growth will be realized through these transformational efforts over time. there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving long-term growth or changing the perception of the company from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced a plan to enhance organizational efficiency, update core technology platforms and streamline the company's supply chain network. these initiatives were undertaken as a result of a strategic review of the company's corporate structure which focused on creating an agile and scalable business model. the charges under this plan began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and we anticipate they will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2017. there is no assurance these actions will be successful in achieving our intended results. actual costs incurred and the timeline of these initiatives may differ from our expectations. refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 3, "restructuring activities" for further information regarding these initiatives. if the execution of our plans or strategies fall short, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach and stuart weitzman stores in mainland china, europe and other international markets, both directly and through strategic partners. our brands may not be well-established or widely sold in some of these markets, and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there. in addition, some of these markets have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. consequently, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. 12 we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 45% of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company's exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, including the impact of (1) the united kingdom voting to leave the european union in its referendum on june 23, 2016 and (2) the outcome of the 2016 u.s. presidential election. on june 23, 2016, the united kingdom (u.k.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union (e.u.), commonly referred to as brexit. as a result of the referendum, it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the u.k. and e.u. brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationship with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates; compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the u.k. bribery act, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials; changes in tourist shopping patterns, particularly that of the chinese consumer; natural and other disasters; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls; and the repatriation of foreign cash. economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag, footwear and accessories categories generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the company's products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. in addition, the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by (1) the location of the store within the mall or shopping center, (2) surrounding tenants or vacancies; (3) increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located; (4) the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall; and (5) a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic. our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brands. 13 increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. furthermore, the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of the company's wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations. one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions, such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings, llc during fiscal 2015. our management team has and will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition, and while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms. the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex, costly and time-consuming. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business, such as stuart weitzman, and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things: failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets; delays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets; higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or synergies and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties; difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations; diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations; the impact on our or an acquired business' internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business; consumers' failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees; assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; and other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, including stuart weitzman, and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. we are required annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred. if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014; however, we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 14 computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers, employees and lawmakers is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats, or to comply with state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face sizable fines, significant breach-notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. in addition, we maintain e-commerce sites in the u.s., canada, u.k., japan, mainland china and south korea and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. additionally, coach has informational websites in various countries, as described in item i, "business." lastly, our e-commerce programs also include an invitation-only coach outlet flash sale site. given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer viruses or power outages. any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and the stuart weitzman brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. we believe that the coach brand, established 75 years ago, is regarded as america's preeminent designer, producer, and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design, our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics, our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service. furthermore, the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of women's luxury footwear within north america, with a strong opportunity for growth globally, and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifully-constructed shoe, merging fashion and function. any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies, including our transformation plan and operational efficiency initiatives. even if our products, marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 15 our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure. in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our subsidiaries' u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in japan and canada and euro-denominated inventory purchases in spain, as well as the company's cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries' foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result of operating retail stores outside of the u.s., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar could impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the u.s. in addition, our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices. our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance, including our ability to return value to investors. our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends. investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors' expectations. see if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend. failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party's rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as u.s. laws. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of, or significant fluctuations in the cost of, raw materials; compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations; 16 imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; increases in the cost of labor, fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation; compliance with our global business integrity program; compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct, as applicable; compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company's products and the fcpa and u.k. bribery act, as applicable; disruptions or delays in shipments; loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites; inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company's cost-effective sourcing model; product quality issues; political unrest; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases; natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; and acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. in addition, we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct; however, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier code of conduct are available through our website, www.coach.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers. if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, operated by coach. to support our growth in mainland china and europe, we established distribution centers in shanghai, china and oldenzaal, the netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, mainland china, hong kong, macau, singapore, taiwan, malaysia, the united states, spain, canada and south korea. the warehousing of the company's merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center's operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations. we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. if we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. we do not own any of our retail store locations. we lease our corporate-owned stores under long-term, non-cancelable leases, which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years, with renewal options typically in five year increments. we believe that the leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancelable and have similar renewal options. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. in some instances, we may be 17 unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. in addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel. the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by: our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. our transformation plan and operational efficiency initiatives and their attendant organizational changes, as well as the impact of brexit, may intensify this risk. we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. in recent years, we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles. the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel. our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our north american wholesale business comprised approximately 4% of total net sales for fiscal 2016 . continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees' products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. additionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the u.s., have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise. despite our planned reduction in markdown allowances during fiscal 2017, such promotional activity could negatively impact our brands, which could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. as we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions. as part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock. seasonality primarily impacts the coach brand. because coach brand's products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. poor sales in the company's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events. 18 we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. we currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for our footwear, eyewear, watches and fragrance products. see item 1 - business - products for additional discussion of our licensing arrangements. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner's ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners. for example, we do not intend to renew our agreement with our existing footwear licensing partner when it expires in late fiscal 2017, and bring the category in-house. while we believe we have the infrastructure and systems in place to bring this category in-house, we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with this process. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. changes in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the credit and capital markets and adversely impact our financial results or our business initiatives. we have maintained and accessed revolving credit facilities and issued debt securities as a source of liquidity, along with cash flows generated from our operations, our available cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, our non-current investments, and other available financing options. we remain committed to maintaining a strong financial profile with ample liquidity. our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. we could experience disruptions to our operations in connection with the relocation to our new global corporate headquarters. the company entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company's new global corporate headquarters in a new office building located at 10 hudson yards in new york city. on august 1, 2016, the company sold its ownership interest in the building and substantially all of the related tenant improvements for a purchase price of approximately $707 million (net of approximately $77 million due to the developer of hudson yards) before transaction costs of $26 million, resulting in a gain of about $30 million, which will be amortized through selling, general and administrative expenses over the lease term of 20 years. the company has simultaneously entered into a 20-year lease for the headquarters space, comprised of approximately 694,000 square feet. refer to note 11, "commitments and contingencies," and note 19, "subsequent events," for further information. we began occupying the new building during fiscal 2016, with occupancy in the new global headquarters expected to be complete in the first half of fiscal 2017. due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature, certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete the project. in addition, the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations. thus, our move could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. provisions in the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party. the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board. the company's charter permits its board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue. in addition, the company's board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified 19 shares. although the company's board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the company's stockholders. the company's bylaws can only be amended by our board. the company's bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to the company's board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by the company's board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the company's bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between the company and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the company's common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by the company's board. risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts ( hdrs ) an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly. we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange will develop or be sustained. if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained, the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected. as a result, the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach's common stock on the nyse, even allowing for currency differences. the characteristics of the u.s. capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different. the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different levels of retail and institutional participation). as a result of these differences, the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same, even allowing for currency differences. fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances particular to the u.s. capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs. because of the different characteristics of the u.s. and hong kong equity markets, the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by u.s. federal and maryland state laws and regulations. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange. our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations. u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong. there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong. we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong (the sfc ) that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence, these codes will not apply to us. we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong. in addition, we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules. neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules, regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied, and been granted, waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc. additionally, if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our non-compliance with applicable undertakings for any reason, additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming, and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance, which could adversely affect us and hdr holders. as the sfc does not have extra-territorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement, it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states. investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates. furthermore, prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware, among other things, that there are u.s. federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders. 20 hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs (the hdr depositary ) to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company. hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders. they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs (the deposit agreement ). holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders' meetings, and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary. there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs, or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote, although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote. as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs, holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary (or its nominee) to exercise rights on their behalf. in addition, holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs. holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them. if we decide to undertake an equity offering (that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders), hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock, as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering. holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers. any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs. an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers, including but not limited to the hdr depositary, the registrar for the hdrs, the custodian and any sub-custodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock. a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations, whether or not by culpable default, could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment. the company will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian, any sub-custodian or the registrar; hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited. however, the company and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary. withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs. our common stock is presently traded on the nyse. any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse. upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock, the relevant hdrs will be canceled. in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently canceled, the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected. the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock (and vice versa) might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period. there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded. in addition, the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa). investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay. in addition, there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate. investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and u.s. dollars. the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar/hong kong dollar exchange rate. while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the u.s. dollar using a specified trading band, no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 51 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows, arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the company's risk management policies, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, our foreign currency exchange risk is limited. the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries' u.s. dollar and euro denominated inventory purchases. to mitigate such risk, coach japan, coach canada and stuart weitzman enter into foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily forward foreign currency contracts. as of july 2, 2016 and june 27, 2015 , zero-cost collar options and forward foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of $190.1 million and $126.7 million , respectively, were outstanding. as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions. the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of july 2, 2016 . the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany loans which are not long term in investment nature. this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the singapore dollar, the euro, the british pound sterling, the new taiwan dollar and the chinese renminbi. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company primarily enters into forward exchange. as of july 2, 2016 and june 27, 2015 , the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts related to these loans were $75.5 million and $25.8 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 2, 2016 and june 27, 2015 was $0.6 million and $3.4 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at july 2, 2016 and june 27, 2015 was $11.1 million and $0.2 million , respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss. as of july 2, 2016 , a 10% devaluation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values. interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its amended and restated credit agreement, including the term loan, the 4.250% senior notes and investments. our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement, including the term loan. on august 3, 2016, the company prepaid its outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility. refer to note 19, "subsequent events," for further information. borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at coach's option, either (a) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus an applicable margin or (b) an alternate base rate (which is a rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of 1% or (iii) the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%). a hypothetical 10% change in the amended and restated credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an insignificant change in interest expense in fiscal 2016. furthermore, we are also exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of our $600.0 million 4.250% senior notes. at july 2, 2016 , the fair value of the 4.250% senior notes was approximately $621.6 million . 51 the company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company's investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes.risk factors 12 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations. one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions, such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings, llc during fiscal 2015 and our recent acquisition of kate spade &amp; company on july 11, 2017. our management team has and will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition, and while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms. the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex, costly and time-consuming. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business, such as stuart weitzman and kate spade, and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things: failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets; delays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets; higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or synergies and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties; difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations; diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations; the impact on our or an acquired business' internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business; consumers' failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees; assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; and other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, including stuart weitzman and/or kate spade, and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. we are required annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to test goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred. if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015; however, we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. the successful execution of our operational efficiency and multi-year transformation initiatives is key to the long-term growth of our business. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced a plan to enhance organizational efficiency, update core technology platforms and streamline the company's supply chain network. these initiatives were undertaken as a result of a strategic review of the company's corporate structure which focused on creating an agile and scalable business model. the charges under this plan 12 began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and were substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2017. there is no assurance these actions will be successful in achieving our intended results. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we announced a multi-year strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth, which will enable the company to return to 'best-in-class' profitability. key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan included: (i) the investment in capital improvements in our stores and wholesale locations to drive comparable sales improvement; (ii) the optimization and streamlining of our organizational model as well as the closure of underperforming stores in north america, and select international stores; (iii) the realignment of inventory levels and mix to reflect our elevated product strategy and consumer preferences; (iv) the investment in incremental advertising costs to elevate consumer perception of our coach brand, drive sales growth and promote our new strategy; and (v) the significant scale-back of our promotional cadence in an increased global promotional environment, particularly within our outlet internet sales site. the company's execution of these key operational and cost measures concluded during fiscal 2016. the company believes that long-term growth will be realized through these transformational efforts over time. there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in achieving long-term growth or changing the perception of the company from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand. actual costs incurred and the timeline of these initiatives may differ from our expectations. refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 3, "restructuring activities" for further information regarding these initiatives. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach and stuart weitzman stores in mainland china, europe and other international markets, both directly and through strategic partners. our brands may not be well-established or widely sold in some of these markets, and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there. in addition, some of these markets have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. consequently, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 46% of our net sales from the coach and stuart weitzman brands coming from operations outside of united states. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company's exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, including the potential impact of (1) new policies that may be implemented by the u.s. or other jurisdictions, particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or (2) the united kingdom ("u.k.") voting to leave the european union ("e.u."), commonly known as brexit. on march 29, 2017, the u.k. triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting negotiations with the e.u. the u.k. has two years to complete these negotiations. although the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. are still unknown, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the u.k. and e.u. brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationship with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates; 13 compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the u.k. bribery act, and other global anti-corruption laws, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials; changes in tourist shopping patterns, particularly that of the chinese consumer; natural and other disasters; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions changes to the u.s.'s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, retaliatory tariffs, embargoes and other stringent government controls economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag, footwear and accessories categories generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the company's products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales. the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by (1) the location of the store within the mall or shopping center; (2) surrounding tenants or vacancies; (3) increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located; (4) the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall; and (5) a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic. declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value. our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brands. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. furthermore, the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of the company's wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. 14 computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers, employees and lawmakers is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats, or to comply with state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face sizable fines, significant breach-notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. in addition, we maintain e-commerce sites in the u.s., canada, japan, mainland china, south korea and several throughout europe and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. additionally, coach has informational websites in various countries, as described in item i, "business." our e-commerce programs also include an invitation-only coach outlet flash sale site. given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer viruses or power outages. any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. the company has embarked on a multi-year erp implementation. the company began implementation in fiscal 2017 and will continue in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. if the execution of our plans falls short, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. we believe that the coach brand, established over 75 years ago, is regarded as america's preeminent designer, producer, and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design, our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics, our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service. furthermore, the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of women's luxury footwear within north america, with a strong opportunity for growth globally, and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifully-constructed shoe, merging fashion and function. any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies, including our operational efficiency initiatives and transformation plan. even if our products, marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 15 our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure. in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our subsidiaries' u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in japan and canada and euro-denominated inventory purchases in spain, as well as the company's cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries' foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result of operating retail stores outside of the u.s., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. for example, the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in the global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the u.s. dollar could impact consumers' willingness or ability to travel abroad and/or purchase our products while traveling, as well as require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margin in various locations outside of the u.s. in addition, our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices. our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance, including our ability to return value to investors. our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends. investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors' expectations. see if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend. failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party's rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as u.s. laws. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of, or significant fluctuations in the cost of, raw materials; compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations; 16 imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; increases in the cost of labor, fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation; compliance with our global business integrity program; compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct, as applicable; compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company's products and the fcpa, u.k. bribery act and other global anti-corruption laws, as applicable; disruptions or delays in shipments; loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites; inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company's cost-effective sourcing model; product quality issues; political unrest; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases; natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; and acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. in addition, we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct; however, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier code of conduct are available through our website, www.coach.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers. if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, operated by coach. to support our growth in mainland china and europe, we established distribution centers in shanghai, china and oldenzaal, the netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, mainland china, hong kong, macau, singapore, taiwan, malaysia, the united states, spain, canada and south korea. the warehousing of the company's merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center's operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations. we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. if we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. we do not own any of our retail store locations. we lease the majority of our stores under long-term, non-cancelable leases, which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years, often with renewal options. we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancelable. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, 17 payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. in some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. in addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel. the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by: our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk. we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. in recent years, we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles. the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel. our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our north american wholesale business comprised approximately 3% of total net sales for fiscal 2017 . continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees' products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. additionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the u.s., have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise. despite our reduction in markdown allowances during fiscal 2017, such promotional activity could negatively impact our brands, which could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. as we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions. as part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. u.s. lawmakers are evaluating proposals for substantial changes to u.s. fiscal and tax policies, which could include comprehensive tax reform. a variety of tax reform proposals that would significantly impact u.s. taxation of corporations are under consideration, including elimination of the interest deduction, taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings and reductions in the u.s. corporate tax rate. we cannot predict which, if any, of these proposals will be enacted into law or the resulting impact any such enactment will have on our financial results. however, if new legislation were enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 18 our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock. the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year. poor sales in the company's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. the coach brand currently has multi-year agreements with licensing partners for our eyewear, watches and fragrance products. see item 1 - business - products for additional discussion of our licensing arrangements. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner's ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could materially adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners. for example, we did not renew our agreement with our prior footwear licensing partner when it expired in late fiscal 2017 and brought the category in-house. while we believe we have the infrastructure and systems in place to successfully bring this category in-house, we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with this process or any future action to bring currently licensed categories in-house. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. as of july 1, 2017, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.6 billion. subsequent to fiscal year 2017, we borrowed $1.1 billion in term loans. together with our cash on hand and cash on hand at kate spade, along with the $1.0 billion of senior notes and $1.1 billion in term loans, we financed our acquisition of kate spade. we also have $600 million of additional senior unsecured notes outstanding and capacity to borrow up to $900 million of additional indebtedness under our undrawn revolving credit facility, which may be used to finance our working capital needs, capital expenditures, permitted investments, share purchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes. this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities. in addition, the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, engage in mergers and dispose of assets. these consequences and limitations could reduce the benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition of kate spade or impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. in addition, our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. 19 provisions in the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party. the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board. the company's charter permits a majority of its entire board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue. in addition, the company's board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although the company's board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the company's stockholders. the company's bylaws can only be amended by our board. the company's bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the company's board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by the company's board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the company's board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the company's bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including, in certain circumstances specified in the statute, issuances of equity securities, between the company and any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the company's common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by the company's board. risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts ( hdrs ) an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly. we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange will develop or be sustained. if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained, the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected. as a result, the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach's common stock on the nyse, even allowing for currency differences. the characteristics of the u.s. capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different. the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different levels of retail and institutional participation). as a result of these differences, the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same, even allowing for currency differences. fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances particular to the u.s. capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs. because of the different characteristics of the u.s. and hong kong equity markets, the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by u.s. federal and maryland state laws and regulations. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange. our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations. u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong. there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong. we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong (the sfc ) that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence, these codes will not apply to us. we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong. in addition, we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules. neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules, regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied, and been granted, waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc. additionally, if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our non-compliance with applicable undertakings for any reason, additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming, and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance, which could adversely affect us and hdr holders. 20 as the sfc does not have extra-territorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement, it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states. investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates. furthermore, prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware, among other things, that there are u.s. federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders. hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs (the hdr depositary ) to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company. hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders. they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs (the deposit agreement ). holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders' meetings, and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary. there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs, or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote, although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote. as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs, holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary (or its nominee) to exercise rights on their behalf. in addition, holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs. holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them. if we decide to undertake an equity offering (that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders), hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock, as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering. holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers. any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs. an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers, including but not limited to the hdr depositary, the registrar for the hdrs, the custodian and any sub-custodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock. a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations, whether or not by culpable default, could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment. the company will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian, any sub-custodian or the registrar; hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited. however, the company and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary. withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs. our common stock is presently traded on the nyse. any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse. upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock, the relevant hdrs will be canceled. in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently canceled, the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected. the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock (and vice versa) might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period. there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded. in addition, the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa). investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay. in addition, there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate. investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and u.s. dollars. the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar/hong kong dollar exchange rate. while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the u.s. dollar using a specified trading band, no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all. 21 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows, arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the company's risk management policies, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, our foreign currency exchange risk is limited. the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries' u.s. dollar and euro denominated inventory purchases. to mitigate such risk, coach japan, coach canada and stuart weitzman enter into forward currency contracts, primarily forward currency contracts. as of july 1, 2017 and july 2, 2016 , forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of $146.9 million and $126.7 million , respectively, were outstanding. as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions. the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of july 1, 2017 . the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany loans which are not long term in investment nature. this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the euro, the chinese renminbi, the british pound sterling and the singapore dollar. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company primarily enters into forward currency contracts. as of july 1, 2017 and july 2, 2016 , the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were $95.5 million and $75.5 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current assets at july 1, 2017 and july 2, 2016 was $3.5 million and $0.6 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at july 1, 2017 and july 2, 2016 was $1.7 million and $11.1 million , respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss. as of july 1, 2017 , a 10% devaluation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values. interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its revolving credit facility and the term loan facilities (collectively "the facility") entered into under the credit agreement dated may 30, 2017, the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes, 2027 senior notes (collectively the "senior notes") and investments. our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under the facility. borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at coach's option, either (a) an alternate base rate (which is a rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of 1% or (iii) the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%) or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin will be determined by reference to a grid, as defined in the credit agreement, based on the ratio of (a) consolidated debt plus 600% of consolidated lease expense to (b) consolidated ebitdar. a hypothetical 10% change in the credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in interest expense in fiscal 2017. the company is exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of our senior notes. at july 1, 2017 , the fair value of the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately $624 million , $395 million and $596 million , respectively. the interest rate payable on each series of the senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time 52 if either moody's or s&amp;p or a substitute rating agency (as defined in the prospectus supplement furnished with the sec on june 7, 2017), downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the senior notes of such series. the company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company's investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes.risk factors 13 "risk factors, " for further information as it relates to the company's enterprise resource planning ("erp") system implementation efforts. trademarks and patents tapestry owns all of the material worldwide trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all branded products for coach, stuart weitzman and kate spade. in addition, it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects. tapestry also owns and maintains worldwide registrations for trademarks in relevant classes of products in each of the countries in which its products are sold. major trademarks include tapestry, coach, stuart weitzman, kate spade and kate spade new york. it also owns brand-specific trademarks such as coach and horse &amp; carriage design, coach and story patch design, coach and lozenge design, coach and tag design, signature c design, coach est. 1941 and design for the coach brand; kate spade new york and spade design, live colorfully, walk on air and in full bloom for the kate spade new york brand; and in our shoes and sw logo for the stuart weitzman brand. tapestry is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although tapestry believes that the coach, stuart weitzman and kate spade names are important for its business. in addition, tapestry owns several design patents and utility patents for its branded products. tapestry aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the respective online reporting tools for each brand, the tapestry hotline and business partners around the world. the company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them. seasonality the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. during the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the winter and holiday season. in the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events. government regulation most of the company's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the u.s. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. the company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. to maximize opportunities, the company operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. additionally, the company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. as a result, the company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the company's products. the company maintains an internal global trade, customs and product compliance organization to help manage its import/export and regulatory affairs activity. 11 competition the global premium women's and men's handbag, accessories and footwear categories are highly competitive. tapestry, inc. competes primarily with european and american luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. over the last several years these industries have grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. this increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories. employees as of june 30, 2018 , the company employed approximately 20,800 globally, including both full and part time employees, but excluding seasonal and temporary employees. of these employees, approximately 9,400 and 7,800 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the global retail field. the company believes that its relations with its employees are good, and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage. financial information about geographic areas refer to note 16, "segment information," presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for geographic information. available information our annual reports on form 10-k, quarterly reports on form 10-q, current reports on form 8-k and all amendments to these reports filed or

31.1 to this form 10-k. additionally, the company filed with the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) the ceo's certification regarding the company's compliance with the nyse's corporate governance listing standards ( listing standards ) pursuant to section 303a.12(a) of the listing standards, which indicated that the ceo was not aware of any violations of the listing standards by the company. 12 item 1a. risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations. one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions, such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings, llc during fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of kate spade &amp; company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. our management team has and will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition, and while we continually review potential acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms. the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex, costly and time-consuming. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business, such as stuart weitzman and kate spade, and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things: failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets; delays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets; higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or synergies and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties; difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations; diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations; the impact on our or an acquired business' internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business; consumers' failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees; assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; and other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business, including stuart weitzman and/or kate spade, and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. we are required annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred. if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016; however, we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets. should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. a delay, disruption in, failure of, or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow. we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations, including management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing in our brands' stores, our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes. we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems. 13 the company has embarked on a multi-year erp implementation. the company began this implementation in fiscal 2017 and it is expected to be substantially complete during fiscal 2019. implementing new systems carries substantial risk, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with other systems, potential loss of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays and disruption of operations. third-party vendors are also relied upon to design, program, maintain and service our erp implementation program. any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business. other substantial risks associated with the multi-year erp implementation include the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands' stores or customers in a timely manner. in addition, any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our erp implementation plan could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate or inaccessible. furthermore, failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services, as well as consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations, individually or in accumulation, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally into a global house of lifestyle brands. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach, kate spade and stuart weitzman stores throughout asia and other international markets, both directly and through strategic partners. our brands may not be well-established or widely sold in some of these markets, and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there. in addition, some of these markets have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. consequently, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. the successful execution of our operational efficiency and multi-year transformation initiatives is key to the long-term growth of our business. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we announced a plan to enhance organizational efficiency, update core technology platforms and optimize international supply chain and office locations. these initiatives were adopted as a result of a strategic review of the company's corporate structure which focused on creating an agile and scalable business model. the charges under this plan began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. there is no assurance these actions will be successful in achieving our intended results. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we announced a multi-year strategic plan with the objective of transforming the brand and reinvigorating growth. key operational and cost elements in order to fund and execute this plan concluded during fiscal 2016. the company believes that long-term growth will be realized through these transformational efforts over time, however there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in the long-term. actual costs incurred and the timeline of these initiatives may differ from our expectations. refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 5, "restructuring activities" for further information regarding these initiatives. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 41.2% of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company's exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: 14 political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, including the potential impact of (1) new policies that may be implemented by the u.s. or other jurisdictions, particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or (2) the united kingdom ("u.k.") voting to leave the european union ("e.u."), commonly known as brexit. on march 29, 2017, the u.k. triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting negotiations with the e.u. the u.k. and e.u. announced in march 2018 an agreement in principle to transitional provisions under which e.u. law would remain in force in the u.k. until the end of december 2020, but this remains subject to the successful conclusion of a final withdrawal agreement between the parties. in the absence of such an agreement there would be no transitional provisions and a "hard" brexit would occur on march 29, 2019. although the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. are still unknown, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the u.k. and e.u. brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationship with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees and resulting in increased cost by way of new or elevated customs duties or financial implications from operational challenges; changes to the u.s.'s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs (including, but not limited to, the trump administration's tariffs on china and china's retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the u.s.), trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates; compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the u.k. bribery act, and other global anti-corruption laws, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials; changes in tourist shopping patterns, particularly that of the chinese consumer; natural and other disasters; changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change and other environmental legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag, footwear and accessories categories generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the company's products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales. the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by (1) the location of the store within the mall or shopping center; (2) surrounding tenants or vacancies; (3) increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located; (4) the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall; and (5) a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic. declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value. our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes 15 in consumer spending patterns. if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brands. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. furthermore, the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers, employees and lawmakers is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats, or to comply with current and new state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation in the e.u. and the california consumer privacy act in california, u.s.a., as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face sizable fines, significant breach-notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. in addition, we have e-commerce sites in certain countries throughout the world, including the u.s., canada, japan, mainland china, several throughout europe and south korea and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. additionally, tapestry has informational websites in various countries, as described in item i, "business." our e-commerce programs also include an invitation-only coach outlet flash sale site and invitation-only kate spade flash sale site. given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer viruses or power outages. any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of the company's wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. 16 the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. tapestry, inc. is a new york-based house of modern luxury lifestyle brands. our company and our brands are founded upon a consumer-led view of luxury that stands for inclusivity and approachability. we believe that the coach brand, established over 75 years ago, is regarded as america's preeminent designer, producer, and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design, our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics, our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service. kate spade is known for its crisp color, graphic prints, and playful sophistication; its exuberant approach to the everyday encourages personal style with a dash of incandescent charm. furthermore, the stuart weitzman brand is viewed as a leading design house of women's luxury footwear within north america, with a strong opportunity for growth globally, and is built upon the idea of crafting a beautifully-constructed shoe, merging fashion and function. any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies, including our operational efficiency initiatives and transformation plan. even if our products, marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure. in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements, we hedge a portion of our subsidiaries' u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in japan, canada and china and euro-denominated inventory purchases in spain, as well as the company's cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries' foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result of having operations outside of the u.s., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted. our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance, including our ability to return value to investors. our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, operating income, net interest expense, earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections. while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends. investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate differs from investors' expectations. refer to if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed for addition discussion of our quarterly dividend. 17 failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party's rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as u.s. laws. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of, or significant fluctuations in the cost of, raw materials; compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations; imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; increases in the cost of labor, fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation; compliance with our global business integrity program; compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct, as applicable; compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company's products and the fcpa, u.k. bribery act and other global anti-corruption laws, as applicable; disruptions or delays in shipments; loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites; inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company's cost-effective sourcing model; product quality issues; political unrest; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases; natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; and acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. if the trump administration follows through on its proposed china tariffs, or if additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by other countries or by the u.s., the cost of our products manufactured in china or other countries and imported into the u.s. or other countries could increase. this could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. in addition, we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct; however, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier code of conduct are available through our website, www.tapestry.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent 18 manufacturer's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers. if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, operated by tapestry. to support our growth in mainland china and europe, we established distribution centers in mainland china and the netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, mainland china, hong kong, macau, singapore, taiwan, malaysia, the u.s., spain, italy, the u.k., canada and south korea. the warehousing of the company's merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center's operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations. we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. if we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. we do not own any of our retail store locations. we lease the majority of our stores under long-term, non-cancelable leases, which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years, often with renewal options. we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancelable. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. in some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. in addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel. the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by: our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk. we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. in recent years, we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles. the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel. our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our wholesale business comprised approximately 13% of total net sales for fiscal 2018. continued fragmentation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees' products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. additionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the u.s., have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise. despite our continued reduction in markdown allowances during fiscal 2018, such promotional activity could negatively impact our brands, which could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 19 as we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions. as part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. on december 22, 2017, h.r.1, formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax legislation ) was signed into law. the tax legislation, which became effective on january 1, 2018, significantly revised the u.s. tax code. refer to item 2, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition &amp; results of operations - executive overview and note 14, income taxes, for further information on the provisions of the tax legislation and the currently expected impact on the company. the company has recorded its best estimate of impact of the tax legislation through its provision for income taxes in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 pursuant to accounting standards codification ("asc") 740, income taxes, and the sec staff accounting bulletin ( sab ) 118. all amounts recorded were based on available guidance on interpretation of the tax legislation and, the company believes, reasonable approaches to estimating its impact; however, such amounts are the company's provisional estimates at this time. for elements of the tax legislation where the company was not yet able to make reasonable estimates of the impact, the company has not recorded any adjustments and has continued accounting for these elements in accordance with asc 740 on the basis of the tax laws in effect before the tax legislation. the company cannot determine the amount of any such impacts at this time and amounts that have been estimated and recorded in the fiscal year ended june 30, 2018 are subject to adjustment as future guidance becomes available, additional facts become known or estimation approaches are refined. the overall impact of the tax legislation is currently uncertain, and the company's business and financial condition could be adversely affected. we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock. the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year. poor sales in the company's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. our brands currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for certain products. refer to item 1 - business - licensing for additional discussion of our key licensing arrangements. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner's ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners. for example, we did not renew our agreement with our prior footwear licensing partner when it expired in late fiscal 2017 and brought the category in-house. while we believe we have the infrastructure and systems in place to successfully bring this category in-house, we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with this process or any future action to bring currently licensed categories in-house. 20 if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. the dividend program requires the use of a moderate portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends, or pay dividends at expected levels, after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. as of june 30, 2018, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.6 billion. we also have the capacity to borrow up to $900 million of additional indebtedness under our undrawn revolving credit facility, which may be used to finance our working capital needs, capital expenditures, permitted investments, share purchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes. this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities. in addition, the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, engage in mergers and dispose of assets. these consequences and limitations could reduce the benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition of kate spade or impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. in addition, our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. provisions in the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party. the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board. the company's charter permits a majority of its entire board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue. in addition, the company's board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although the company's board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the company's stockholders. the company's bylaws can be amended by our board or by the approval of a majority of our stockholders. the company's bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the company's board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by the company's board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the company's board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the company's bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including mergers, consolidations, share exchanges, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, between the company and any interested stockholder, generally defined as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the company's common stock, or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 52 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows, arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. the company manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the company's risk management policies, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, our foreign currency exchange risk is limited. the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries' u.s. dollar and euro denominated inventory purchases. to mitigate such risk, certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts. as of june 30, 2018 and july 1, 2017 , forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of $257.4 million and $146.9 million , respectively, were outstanding. as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions. the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 30, 2018 . the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany loans which are not long term in investment nature. this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the euro, the japanese yen, the chinese renminbi, the australian dollar and the british pound sterling. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company enters into forward currency contracts. as of june 30, 2018 and july 1, 2017 , the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were $160.7 million and $95.5 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current assets at june 30, 2018 and july 1, 2017 was $6.0 million and $3.5 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at june 30, 2018 and july 1, 2017 was $2.4 million and $1.7 million , respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss. as of june 30, 2018 , a 10% devaluation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values. interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its revolving credit facility entered into under the credit agreement dated may 30, 2017, the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes, 2027 senior notes (collectively the "senior notes") and investments. our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility. borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the company's option, either (a) an alternate base rate (which is a rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of 1% or (iii) the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%) or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin will be determined by reference to a grid, as defined in the credit agreement, based on the ratio of (a) consolidated debt plus 600% of consolidated lease expense to (b) consolidated ebitdar. a hypothetical 10% change in the credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in interest expense in fiscal 2018. the company is exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of the senior notes. at june 30, 2018 , the fair value of the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately $593 million , $389 million and $574 million , respectively. at july 1, 2017, the fair value of the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes 52 was approximately $624 million , $395 million and $596 million , respectively. these fair values are based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices of these instruments, and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency, among other factors, and are classified as level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. the interest rate payable on the 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody's or s&amp;p or a substitute rating agency (as defined in the prospectus supplement furnished with the sec on june 7, 2017) downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the respective senior note of such series. the company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company's investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes.risk factors 13 "risk factors, " for further information as it relates to the company's erp system implementation efforts. trademarks and patents tapestry owns all of the material trademark rights around the world used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all branded products for coach, stuart weitzman and kate spade. in addition, it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects. tapestry also owns and maintains registrations in countries around the world for trademarks in relevant classes of products. major trademarks include tapestry, coach, stuart weitzman, kate spade and kate spade new york. it also owns brand-specific trademarks such as coach and horse &amp; carriage design, coach and story patch design, coach and lozenge design, coach and tag design, signature c design, coach est. 1941 and design for the coach brand; kate spade new york and spade design, live colorfully, walk on air and in full bloom for the kate spade new york brand; and the sw logo for the stuart weitzman brand. tapestry is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although tapestry believes that the coach, stuart weitzman and kate spade names are important for its business. in addition, tapestry owns a number of design patents and utility patents for its brands' products. tapestry aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the respective online reporting form for each brand, the tapestry hotline and business partners around the world. the company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them. 11 seasonality the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. during the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the winter and holiday season. in the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events. government regulation most of the company's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the u.s. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. the company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. to maximize opportunities, the company operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. additionally, the company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. as a result, the company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the company's products. the company maintains an internal global trade, customs and product compliance organization to help manage its import/export and regulatory affairs activity. competition the global premium women's and men's handbag, accessories and footwear categories are highly competitive. the company competes primarily with european and american luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. over the last several years these industries have grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. this increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories. employees as of june 29, 2019 , the company employed approximately 21,000 globally, including both full and part time employees, but excluding seasonal and temporary employees. of these employees, approximately 10,100 and 7,200 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the global retail field. the company believes that its relations with its employees are good, and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage. financial information about geographic areas refer to note 17, "segment information,"

following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations. one component of our growth strategy is acquisitions, such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings, llc during fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of kate spade &amp; company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. our management team has and, in the future, will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms. the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex, costly and time-consuming. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business, such as stuart weitzman and kate spade, and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things: failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets; delays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets; higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or synergies and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties; difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations; diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations; the impact on our or an acquired business' internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business; consumers' failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees; assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; and other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. we are required annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred. if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. we determined there was no impairment in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017; however, we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets. should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. a delay, disruption in, failure of, or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow. we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations, including management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing in our brands' stores, our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes. we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems. the company embarked on a multi-year erp implementation in fiscal 2017. the substantial majority of the implementation was completed during fiscal 2019 and the remainder implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2020. implementing new systems 13 carries substantial risk, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with other systems, potential loss of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays and disruption of operations. third-party vendors are also relied upon to design, program, maintain and service our erp implementation program. any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business. other substantial risks associated with the multi-year erp implementation include the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands' stores or customers in a timely manner. in addition, any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our erp implementation plan could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate or inaccessible. furthermore, failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services, as well as consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations, individually or in accumulation, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally into a global house of lifestyle brands. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we plan to open additional retail stores throughout asia and other international markets, both directly and through strategic partners. our brands may not be well-established or widely sold in some of these markets, and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there. in addition, some of these markets have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. consequently, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 43.7% of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company's exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, including the potential impact of (1) new policies that may be implemented by the u.s. or other jurisdictions, particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or (2) the united kingdom ("u.k.") voting to leave the european union ("e.u."), commonly known as brexit. on march 29, 2017, the u.k. triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting negotiations with the e.u. the u.k. and e.u. announced in march 2018 an agreement in principle to transitional provisions under which e.u. law would remain in force in the u.k. until the end of december 2020, but this remains subject to the successful conclusion of a final withdrawal agreement between the parties. as a consequence, the e.u. and u.k. agreed to postpone brexit until october 31, 2019. this date will be accelerated to anytime between now and october 31, 2019 if a withdrawal agreement is successfully concluded between the parties and ratified by u.k. parliament. increased uncertainty surrounds future brexit talks due to the new leadership of the british government following theresa may's resignation as prime minister on june 7, 2019 and the election of boris johnson on july 23, 2019. in the absence of a withdrawal agreement there would be no transitional provisions and a "hard" brexit would occur on october 31, 2019. although the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. are still unknown, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the u.k. and e.u. brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees and resulting in increased cost by way of new or elevated customs duties or financial implications from operational challenges; 14 changes to the u.s.'s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs (including, but not limited to, the trump administration's tariffs on china and china's retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the u.s.), trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates; compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the u.k. bribery act, and other global anti-corruption laws, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials; changes in tourist shopping patterns, particularly that of the chinese consumer; natural and other disasters; and changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change and other environmental legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions. we face risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products most of our imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the u.s. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. to maximize opportunities, we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and, as a result, we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our cross-border activity. in may 2019, the united states increased the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on $200 billion of imports of select product categories into the u.s. from china. on august 1, 2019, the trump administration announced that the u.s. plans to implement an additional tariff of 10% on the remaining $300 billion of products imported into the u.s. from china on september 1, 2019. if the u.s. follows through on its further proposed china tariffs, or if the u.s. or other countries impose additional duties, taxes, quotas and/or withdraw from or materially modify trade agreements or other trade restrictions, the cost of our products manufactured in china or such other countries and imported into the u.s. or other countries could increase. this could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag, footwear and accessories categories generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the company's products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes in consumer spending patterns. if we misjudge the market for our products we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brands. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. furthermore, the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show 15 volatility. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales. the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by (1) the location of the store within the mall or shopping center; (2) surrounding tenants or vacancies; (3) increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located; (4) the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall; and (5) a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic. declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value. the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. tapestry, inc. is a new york-based house of modern luxury lifestyle brands. our company and our brands are founded upon a consumer-led view of luxury that stands for inclusivity and approachability. any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. our success also depends in part on our ability to execute on our plans and strategies. even if our products, marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have enterprise class and industry comparable security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer malware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers, employees and lawmakers is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personal information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats, or to comply with current and new state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation in the e.u. and the california consumer privacy act in california, u.s.a., as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face sizable fines, significant breach containment and notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. 16 in addition, we have e-commerce sites in certain countries throughout the world, including the u.s., canada, japan, mainland china, several throughout europe and south korea and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. additionally, tapestry has informational websites in various countries, as described in item i, "business." our e-commerce programs also include an invitation-only coach outlet flash sale site and kate spade flash sale site. given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer malware or power outages. any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of the company's wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure. in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our cross currency intercompany inventory transactions, as well as the company's cross currency intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries' foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result of having operations outside of the u.s., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted. our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance, including our ability to return value to investors. our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, operating income, net interest expense, earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections. while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases. investors may have an expectation that we will continue to pay our quarterly dividend at certain levels and / or repurchase shares available under our common stock repurchase program. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs from investors' expectations. refer to if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed for additional discussion of our quarterly dividend. 17 failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party's rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as u.s. laws. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; unavailability of, or significant fluctuations in the cost of, raw materials; compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations; increases in the cost of labor, fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation; compliance with our global business integrity program; compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct, as applicable; compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company's products and the fcpa, u.k. bribery act and other global anti-corruption laws, as applicable; disruptions or delays in shipments; loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites; inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company's cost-effective sourcing model; product quality issues; political unrest, including protests and other civil disruption; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases; natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; and acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. in addition, we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier code of conduct; however, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program documents, including our global operating principles, anti-corruption policy and supplier code of conduct are available through our website, www.tapestry.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18 we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers. if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, operated by tapestry. to support our growth in mainland china and europe, we established distribution centers in mainland china and the netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, hong kong, macau, singapore, taiwan, malaysia, the u.s., spain, italy, the u.k., canada, australia and south korea. the warehousing of the company's merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center's operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations. we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. if we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. we do not own any of our retail store locations. we lease the majority of our stores under long-term, non-cancelable leases, which usually have initial terms ranging from five and ten years, often with renewal options. we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be long-term and non-cancelable. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease and decide to close it as we have done in the past and will do in the future, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. in some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. in addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel. the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk. we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. in recent years, we have evolved our senior leadership team and have focused on retaining key roles. the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel. our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the wholesale industry. our wholesale business comprised approximately 11% of total net sales for fiscal 2019. continued fragmentation in the industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees' products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. additionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the u.s., have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, which could negatively impact our brands or could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. as we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions. as part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could 19 disrupt or harm our business. any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. on december 22, 2017, h.r.1, formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax legislation ) was signed into law. the tax legislation, which became effective on january 1, 2018, significantly revised the u.s. tax code. refer to item 2, management's discussion and analysis of financial condition &amp; results of operations - executive overview and note 15, income taxes, for further information on the provisions of the tax legislation and the currently expected impact on the company. the company has recorded its best estimate of impact of the tax legislation through its provision for income taxes in the fiscal year ended june 29, 2019 pursuant to accounting standards codification ("asc") 740, income taxes, and the sec staff accounting bulletin ( sab ) 118. all amounts recorded were based on available guidance on interpretation of the tax legislation and, the company believes, reasonable approaches to estimating its impact. as future guidance becomes available, adjustments may be made to reflect the impact of such guidance in the provision for income taxes. we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock. the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year. poor sales in the company's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. our brands currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for certain products. refer to item 1 - business - licensing for additional discussion of our key licensing arrangements. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner's ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners and bring certain categories in-house. we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with any action to bring currently licensed categories in-house. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or conduct stock repurchases at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. the dividend program and the stock repurchase program each require the use of a portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends and conduct stock repurchases will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease or entirely discontinue these programs at any time. any failure to pay dividends or conduct stock repurchases, or conduct either program at expected levels, after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. 20 we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. as of june 29, 2019, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.6 billion. we also have the capacity to borrow up to $900 million of additional indebtedness under our undrawn revolving credit facility, which may be used to finance our working capital needs, capital expenditures, permitted investments, share purchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes. this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities. in addition, the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, engage in mergers and dispose of assets. these consequences and limitations could reduce the benefits we expect to achieve from the acquisition of kate spade or impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. in addition, our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. provisions in the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party. the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board. the company's charter permits a majority of its entire board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue. in addition, the company's board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although the company's board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the company's stockholders. the company's bylaws can be amended by our board or by the approval of a majority of the vote entitled to be cast by our stockholders. the company's bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the company's board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by the company's board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the company's board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, at the time of giving notice and at the time of the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the company's bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including mergers, consolidations, share exchanges, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, between the company and any interested stockholder, generally defined as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the company's common stock, or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 47 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows, arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. the company manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the company's risk management policies, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, our foreign currency exchange risk is limited. the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries' transactions denominated in foreign currencies. to mitigate such risk, certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts. as of june 29, 2019 and june 30, 2018 , forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of $398.4 million and $257.4 million , respectively, were outstanding. as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions. the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 29, 2019 . the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany loans. this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the chinese renminbi. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company enters into forward currency contracts. as of june 29, 2019 and june 30, 2018 , the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were $14.5 million and $160.7 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding forward currency contracts included in current assets at june 29, 2019 and june 30, 2018 was $1.1 million and $6.0 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at june 29, 2019 and june 30, 2018 was $4.9 million and $2.4 million , respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss. as of june 29, 2019 , a 10% devaluation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values. interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its revolving credit facility entered into under the credit agreement dated may 30, 2017, the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes, 2027 senior notes (collectively the "senior notes") and investments. our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility. borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the company's option, either (a) an alternate base rate (which is a rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of 1% or (iii) the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%) or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin will be determined by reference to a grid, as defined in the credit agreement, based on the ratio of (a) consolidated debt plus 600% of consolidated lease expense to (b) consolidated ebitdar. a hypothetical 10% change in the credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in interest expense in fiscal 2019. the company is exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of the senior notes. at june 29, 2019 , the fair value of the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately $630 million , $399 million and $606 million , respectively. at june 30, 2018, the fair value of the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately $593 million , $389 million and $574 million , respectively. these fair values are based on external pricing data, 47 including available quoted market prices of these instruments, and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency, among other factors, and are classified as level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. the interest rate payable on the 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody's or s&amp;p or a substitute rating agency (as defined in the prospectus supplement furnished with the sec on june 7, 2017) downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the respective senior notes of such series. the company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company's investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes.risk factors 14 "risk factors, " for further information as it relates to the company's erp system implementation efforts. corporate responsibility tapestry's corporate responsibility strategy, our social fabric, unites teams across our business to work to meet our 2025 corporate responsibility goals and a shared objective: to create the modern luxury company of the future that balances true fashion authority with meaningful, positive change. the company is a signatory to the united nations ("un") global compact, and as such, our corporate responsibility strategy is aligned with the un sustainable development goals. tapestry's goals cover three strategic pillars: our people, our planet and our communities. our people: goals focus on diversity, inclusion, progression and wellness initiatives across our workforce. our planet: goals include sourcing and environmental initiatives to increase

information on our corporate responsibility strategy and 2025 corporate responsibility goals can be found at www.tapestry.com/responsibility . the content on this website and the content in our corporate responsibility reports are not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form 10-k or in any other report or document we file with the sec. trademarks and patents tapestry owns all of the material trademark rights around the world used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all branded products for coach, stuart weitzman and kate spade. in addition, it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects. tapestry also owns and maintains registrations in countries around the world for trademarks in relevant classes of products. major trademarks include tapestry, coach, stuart weitzman, kate spade and kate spade new york. it also owns brand-specific trademarks such as coach and horse &amp; carriage design, coach and story patch design, coach and lozenge design, coach and tag design, signature c design, coach est. 1941 and design for the coach brand; kate spade new york and spade design, live colorfully, walk on air and in full bloom for the kate spade new york brand; and the sw logo for the stuart weitzman brand. tapestry is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although tapestry believes that the coach, stuart weitzman and kate spade names are important for its business. in addition, tapestry owns a number of design patents and utility patents for its brands' products. tapestry aggressively polices its trademarks and trade dress, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. it also pursues counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the respective online reporting form for each brand, the tapestry hotline and business partners around the world. the company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them. seasonality the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. during the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the winter and holiday season. in the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events, including pandemics such as covid-19. government regulation most of the company's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the u.s. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. the company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. to maximize opportunities, the company operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. additionally, the company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. as a result, the company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the company's products. the company maintains an internal global trade, customs and product compliance organization to help manage its import/export and regulatory affairs activity. competition the global premium women's and men's handbag, accessories and footwear categories are highly competitive. the company competes primarily with european and american luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. over the last several years these industries have grown, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. this increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories. employees as of june 27, 2020 , the company employed approximately 17,300 globally, including both full and part time employees, but excluding seasonal and temporary employees. of these employees, approximately 9,200 and 4,900 were full time and part time employees, respectively, in the global retail field. the company believes that its relations with its employees are good, and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage.

factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of the company and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the covid-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions are and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. the covid-19 pandemic has impacted a significant majority of the regions in which we operate, disrupting operations, consumer spending and global supply chains and creating significant disruption and volatility of financial markets. the impacts of covid-19 have and may continue to materially adversely impact our operations, cash flow and liquidity. in march 2020, the outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the world health organization. national, state and local governments have responded to the covid-19 pandemic in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, by declaring states of emergency, restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance (i.e., social distancing), requiring individuals to stay at home, and in most cases, ordering non-essential businesses to close or limit operations. the company had temporarily closed the majority of its directly operated stores globally for some period of time to help reduce the spread of covid-19. as of the end of the fiscal year, the vast majority of the company's stores had been re-opened for either in-store or curb-side service. many of the company's wholesale partners also closed their bricks and mortar stores as required by government orders during the third and fourth fiscal quarter. the global covid-19 pandemic is continuing to evolve rapidly and the extent to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our results and our business - including unforeseen increased costs to our business - will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the ultimate duration, severity and sustained geographic spread of the virus, such as the possibility of a "second wave" of increased infections, and the success of actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. while the full magnitude of the effects on our business is difficult to predict at this time, the covid-19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. although the ultimate severity and impact of the covid-19 pandemic is uncertain at this time and depends on future events outside of our control, our business is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to: the potential economic effects of the pandemic, including a possible recession, increased unemployment and decreased consumer credit availability, may result in lower consumer confidence and decreased disposable income and discretionary spending levels, which may lead to reduced sales of our products. unfavorable economic conditions, fears of becoming ill and sustained travel restrictions may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which the company's stores are located. furthermore, reduced discretionary spending may result in an excess of inventory throughout the industry, which could lead to increased pressure on our gross margin in the near term if the company has to increase promotional activity above its normal levels to sell through its existing product. social distancing measures and general consumer behaviors due to the covid-19 pandemic may continue to impact mall and store traffic even after stores return to normal operations, which may have a further negative impact on our business. furthermore, declines in traffic beyond our current exceptions could result in additional impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value. the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in disruption to the financial markets and caused significant volatility and adverse impact on the value of our common stock. on march 30, 2020, we borrowed $700 million under our $900 million revolving credit facility. if a significant number of our stores are required to close again or sales are lower than expected for an extended period of time, our liquidity may continue to be negatively impacted and we may need to draw additional funds from our revolving credit facility or seek additional sources of financing, which may or may not be available. the company is subject to additional requirements under the terms of the revolving credit facility and its senior notes as described in " we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness" below. while we are making significant efforts to reduce our non-essential sg&amp;a expenses, including but not limited to, through discussions with our landlords and other vendors to obtain rent and other relief, we may not be successful in these endeavors and may be subject to continued expenses and potential litigation or claims from such landlords and vendors. we continue to sell products through our stores that have re-opened and through our e-commerce sites. the majority of our distribution centers remain open and operational through the date of this report; however, such distribution centers may be forced to close or limit operations due to governmental mandates, health and safety concerns, or illness or absence of a substantial number of distribution center employees. our third party logistics providers may also experience delays in fulfilling our orders to our customers. 14 we source and manufacture our products on a global scale and may experience material temporary or long-term disruption in our supply chain, given the global reach of the covid-19 pandemic. travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of business and facilities or social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact the operations of our raw material suppliers or manufacturing partners. the successful execution of our acceleration program is key to the long-term success of our business. the company is undergoing a review of its business under the acceleration program. the guiding principle of this multi-year growth agenda is to better meet the needs of each of its brands' unique customers by (i) sharpening our focus on the customer (ii) leveraging data and leading with a digital-first mindset and (iii) transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization. the company believes the successful execution of these priorities will fuel desire for the coach, kate spade and stuart weitzman brands, driving accelerated revenue growth, higher gross margins and substantial operating leverage across tapestry's portfolio. the acceleration program reflects: (i) actions to streamline the company's organization; (ii) select store closures as the company optimizes its fleet (including store closure costs incurred as the company exits certain regions in which it currently operates); and (iii) professional fees and compensation costs incurred as a result of the development and execution of the company's comprehensive strategic initiatives aimed at increasing profitability. the company believes that long-term growth and increased profitability can be realized through its strategic growth efforts over time. however, there is no assurance that we will be able to implement such efforts in accordance with our plans, that such efforts will result in the intended or otherwise desirable outcomes or that such efforts, even if successfully implemented, will be effective in achieving long-term growth or increased profitability. refer to part ii, item 7, "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" and note 7, "restructuring activities," for further information regarding the acceleration program. further, recent or future changes in our executive leadership team may have an adverse effect on our ability to implement or to achieve favorable results under the acceleration program and/or result in further changes to our strategy. if our execution of the initiatives under our acceleration program falls short, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, pandemics (such as the ongoing covid-19 pandemic) and natural disasters, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. the covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag, footwear and accessories categories generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the company's products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower. unfavorable economic conditions, as well as travel restrictions and potential changes in consumer behavior resulting from the covid-19 pandemic, may also reduce consumers' willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 42.8% of our net sales coming from operations outside of united states. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company's exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: 15 political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, including the potential impact of (1) new policies that may be implemented by the u.s. or other jurisdictions, particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or (2) the united kingdom ("u.k.") voting to leave the european union ("e.u."), commonly known as brexit. on march 29, 2017, the u.k. triggered article 50 of the lisbon treaty formally starting a 2 year negotiation period with the e.u., which was subsequently extended to january 31, 2020. the u.k. officially terminated its membership of the e.u. on january 31, 2020 under the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the u.k. and e.u. and is now a transition phase until december 31, 2020. during the transition phase, the u.k. will generally continue operating as if it were still a member of the e.u. trade talks between the e.u. and u.k., to determine their future relationship, are still underway. if a trade deal is not reached by december 31, 2020, the u.k. can expect checks and tariffs on products going to and coming from the e.u. beginning on january 1, 2021. if a trade deal is not reached by december 31, 2020, the u.k. can expect checks and tariffs on products going to and coming from the e.u. beginning on january 1, 2021. although the terms of the u.k.'s future relationship with the e.u. are still unknown, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the u.k. and e.u. brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees and resulting in increased cost by way of new or elevated customs duties or financial implications from operational challenges; public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemic diseases (including the ongoing covid-19 pandemic); changes to the u.s.'s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs (including, but not limited to, the trump administration's tariffs on china and china's retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the u.s.), trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls; changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates; compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act (fcpa) and the u.k. bribery act, and other global anti-corruption laws, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials; changes in tourist shopping patterns, particularly that of the chinese consumer and as a result of the covid-19 pandemic; natural and other disasters; political and civil unrest, such as the recent protests in hong kong sar, china and in the united states; and changes in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change and other environmental legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports; unavailability of, or significant fluctuations in the cost of, raw materials; compliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations; increases in the cost of labor, fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation; compliance with our global business integrity program; compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our supplier code of conduct and other applicable compliance policies; compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company's products and the fcpa, u.k. bribery act and other global anti-corruption laws, as applicable; disruptions or delays in shipments; loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites; 16 inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company's cost-effective sourcing model; product quality issues; political unrest, including protests and other civil disruption; public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, and other unforeseen outbreaks; natural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. in addition, we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our supplier code of conduct and other compliance policies under our global business integrity program; however, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program documents, including our global operating principles, anti-corruption policy and supplier code of conduct are available through our website, www.tapestry.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer's or supplier's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. we are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers. if any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including as a result of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, operated by tapestry. to support our growth in mainland china and europe, we established distribution centers in mainland china and the netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, parts of greater china (hong kong sar, macao sar and taiwan), singapore, malaysia, the u.s., spain, italy, the u.k., canada, australia and south korea. the warehousing of the company's merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center's operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations. we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. we may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. if we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. we do not own any of our retail store locations. we lease the majority of our stores under non-cancelable leases, which have historically had initial terms ranging from five and ten years, often with renewal options. we believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be non-cancelable. generally, our leases are net leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. in certain cases, as we have done in the past, we may determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease or we may seek to generally downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate or close some of our real estate locations. in such cases, we may be required to negotiate a lease exit with the applicable landlord or remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. for example, in connection with the impact of the covid-19 pandemic and our acceleration program, we are in active negotiations with our landlords on certain store exits. in some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. in addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. additionally, due to the volatile economic environment, it may be difficult to determine the fair market value of real estate properties when we are deciding whether to enter into leases or renew expiring leases. this may impact our ability to manage the 17 profitability of our store locations, or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets if market values decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. a decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales. the success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by (1) closures, operating restrictions and changes in consumer shopping behavior as a result of the covid-19 pandemic; (2) the location of the store within the mall or shopping center; (3) surrounding tenants or vacancies; (4) increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located; (5) the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall; and (6) a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic. declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. furthermore, declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our global omni-channel expansion efforts. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design, introduction of new products and maintaining an appropriate rationalization of our assortment. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products or to rationalize our assortment appropriately could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. our success and growth also depends on the continued development of our omni-channel presence for each of our brands globally, leaning into global digital opportunities for each brand, along with continued bricks and mortar expansion in select international regions, notably mainland china. our brands may not be well-established or widely sold in some of these markets, and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there. in addition, some of these markets, either through bricks and mortar stores or digital channels, have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, privacy, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, expanding in certain markets may have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the short-term. we may also have to compete for talent in international regions as we expand our omni-channel presence. consequently, if our global omni-channel expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected. 18 computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. since the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic, the majority of our corporate employees and contractors have worked remotely for some time and many continue to do so, which has increased our dependence on digital technology during this period. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have enterprise class and industry comparable security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer malware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers, employees and lawmakers is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personal information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats, or to comply with current and new state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential and personal information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the general data protection regulation in the e.u. and the california consumer privacy act in california, u.s.a., as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, covid-19 employee and visitor health checks deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face sizable fines, significant breach containment and notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. in addition, we have e-commerce sites in certain countries throughout the world, including the u.s., canada, japan, mainland china, several throughout europe, australia and south korea and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. additionally, tapestry has informational websites in various countries, as described in item i, "business." given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer malware or power outages. any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. we face risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products. most of our imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the u.s. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. to maximize opportunities, we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and, as a result, we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our cross-border activity. in may 2019, the united states increased the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on $200 billion of imports of select product categories into the u.s. from china. on august 1, 2019, the trump administration announced that the u.s. plans to implement an additional tariff of 10% on the remaining $300 billion of products imported into the u.s. from china on september 1, 2019. however, in january 2020, the u.s. and china reached a phase one trade deal which reduced tariffs to 7.5% on some of the $300 billion of select imports without imposing any retaliatory tariffs on the rest of the products. while the trade deal remains effective, there is no guarantee that the agreement will be honored by either party, which could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations as a result. our business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products. our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes 19 in consumer spending patterns. if we misjudge the market for our products or demand for our products are impacted by an unforeseen factor, such as the covid-19 pandemic, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brands. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. furthermore, the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. tapestry, inc. is a new york-based house of modern luxury lifestyle brands. our company and our brands are founded upon a consumer-led view of luxury that stands for inclusivity and approachability. any misstep in product quality or design, executive leadership, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. our success also depends in part on our and our executive leadership team's ability to execute on our plans and strategies. even if our products, marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. as we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions. as part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. while we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us. we have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness. as of june 27, 2020 , our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion. we also have the capacity to borrow an additional $200 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, which may be used to finance our working capital needs, capital expenditures, permitted investments, share purchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes. this substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities. in addition, the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, engage in mergers and dispose of assets. on may 19, 2020, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility, which requires us to maintain available liquidity of $700 million through october 2, 2021, and waives compliance with our leverage ratio covenant through the date our compliance certificate is delivered for the fiscal quarter ending july 3, 2021 (the covenant relief period ). the amendment also provides that, if any two of tapestry's three credit ratings are non-investment grade during the covenant relief period, tapestry's material domestic subsidiaries will guarantee the credit facility and be subject to liens on accounts receivable, inventory and intellectual property, in each case subject to customary exceptions. in addition to our standard covenants, the amendment also contains limitations on our ability to engage in share buybacks or issue cash dividends during the covenant relief period, amongst other restrictions. an increased interest rate will also be applicable during the covenant relief period when the company's gross leverage ratio exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. in addition, it is possible that the interest rate payable on our 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody's or s&amp;p or a substitute rating agency downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the respective senior notes of such series. refer to note 13, "debt", for additional information on the terms of our revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes. 20 the consequences and limitations under our credit agreement and the amendment thereto and our other outstanding indebtedness could impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions. in addition, a prolonged disruption in our business may impact our ability to satisfy the available liquidity requirement under the amendment to our credit facility and, beyond the term of the covenant relief period, the leverage ratio covenant. non-compliance with these terms would constitute an event of default under our credit facility, which may result in acceleration of payment to the lenders. in the event of an acceleration of payment to the lenders, this would result in a cross default of the company's senior notes, causing the company's outstanding borrowings to also become due and payable on demand. our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations. this, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the financial impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our business. we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. in addition, our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. our success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel. the ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk. we depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. in recent years, we have experienced numerous changes to our senior leadership team. there can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or that we will be able to identify and attract suitable successors for these individuals. the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the direct or indirect consequences of results thereof, or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals or the loss of these individuals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. we do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel. acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations. one component of our growth strategy historically has been acquisitions, such as our acquisition of stuart weitzman holdings, llc during fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of kate spade &amp; company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. although acquisitions are not currently contemplated in the company's near term strategy, our management team has and, in the future, will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms. the integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex, costly and time-consuming. the potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things: failure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets; delays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets; higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or synergies and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties; difficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations; diversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations; the impact on our or an acquired business' internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the sarbanes-oxley act of 2002; unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; retaining key customers, suppliers and employees; retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits; operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business; consumers' failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees; 21 assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; and other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. our failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. completed acquisitions may result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. we are required annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred. if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. during fiscal 2020, the fair value of the stuart weitzman reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand intangible asset did not exceed the respective carrying values, resulting in goodwill impairment charges of $210.7 million and indefinite-lived brand impairment charges of $267.0 million. we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets. should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of the company's wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure. in order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our cross currency intercompany inventory transactions, as well as the company's cross currency intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries' foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars. as a result of having operations outside of the u.s., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted. our stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance, including our ability to return value to investors. our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. we believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. at the same time, however, we recognize that, when possible, it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, operating income, net interest expense, earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections. we did not provide guidance in our earnings report for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding the financial impact of covid-19 on our business. we have decided to continue to not provide guidance at this time and we do not have any responsibility to do so going forward or to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. in addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. however, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. if, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price. we periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases. on march 26, 2020, we announced we were suspending our quarterly dividend payment, effective beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and stock repurchase program due to the impact of covid-19 pandemic. investors may have an expectation that we will resume our dividend at a certain time and at certain levels and / or repurchase shares available under our common stock repurchase program. the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs 22 from investors' expectations. refer to if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed for additional discussion of our quarterly dividend. failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party's rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries' laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as u.s. laws. our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the wholesale industry. our wholesale business comprised approximately 9% of total net sales for fiscal 2020. the retail industry, including wholesale customers, has experienced financial difficulty leading to consolidations, reorganizations, restructuring, bankruptcies and ownership changes. in addition, the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced operations or the closure, temporarily or permanently, of many of our wholesale partners. this is likely to continue and could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, wholesale stores that carry our and our licensees' products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. additionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the u.s., have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, which could negatively impact our brands or could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. a delay, disruption in, failure of, or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow. we rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations, including management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing in our brands' stores, our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes. we are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems. the company embarked on a multi-year erp implementation in fiscal 2017, which was completed in fiscal 2020. implementing new systems carries substantial risk, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with other systems, potential loss of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays and disruption of operations. third-party vendors are also relied upon to design, program, maintain and service our erp systems. any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business. in addition, any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our new erp systems could lead to the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands' stores or customers in a timely manner and/or cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate or inaccessible. furthermore, failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services, as well as consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations, individually or in accumulation, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. 23 current or future tax legislation may impact our tax structure and effective tax rates. on december 22, 2017, h.r.1, formerly known as the tax cuts and jobs act (the tax legislation ) was signed into law. the tax legislation, which became effective on january 1, 2018, significantly revised the u.s. tax code and required the company to estimate the impact of the tax legislation for fiscal year 2019. on march 27, 2020, the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act ( cares act ) was signed into law in response to the covid-19 pandemic. the cares act contains numerous income tax provisions, such as refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes, net operating loss carrybacks, modifications to net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. the tax legislation and the cares act require the company to make significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation of the law and in the calculation of the provision for income taxes. however, additional guidance may be issued by the internal revenue service ( irs ), the department of the treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, or financial conditions. the risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus by stakeholders on corporate responsibility issues, including those associated with climate change, could negatively affect our business and operations. our business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change, including through disruption to our supply chain, potentially impacting the production and distribution of our products and availability and pricing of raw materials. increased frequency and intensity of weather events (storms and floods) due to climate change could also lead to more frequent store closures and/or lost sales as customers prioritize basic needs. there is also increased focus from our stakeholders, including consumers, employees and investors, on corporate responsibility matters. although we have announced our corporate responsibility strategy and 2025 corporate responsibility goals, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our goals. failure to implement our strategy or achieve our goals could damage our reputation, causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in our company and brands, and negatively impact our operations. even if we are able to achieve our 2025 corporate responsibility goals, our business will continue to remain subject to risks associated with climate change. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the company's common stock. the company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year. poor sales in the company's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events, including the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. our brands currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for certain products. refer to item 1 - business - licensing for additional discussion of our key licensing arrangements. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner's ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. we also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners and bring certain categories in-house. we may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with any action to bring currently licensed categories in-house. we have decided to suspend our quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program; there can be no assurance if, when and at what level our board of directors will authorize dividend payments or stock repurchases in the future. on march 26, 2020, the company announced that, due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic, tapestry's quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, along with the stock repurchase program would be suspended. while our board of directors intends to authorize dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate, there can be no assurance if, when and at what level our board of directors may resume making dividend payments. the company is restricted from declaring cash dividends or repurchasing shares under the negative covenants associated with amendment no. 1 to the revolving credit facility during the covenant relief period. the dividend program and the stock repurchase program each require the use of a 24 portion of our cash flow. our ability to begin to pay dividends and conduct stock repurchases in the future will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease or entirely discontinue these programs at any time. any failure to pay dividends or conduct stock repurchases, or conduct either program at expected levels, after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. provisions in the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the company by a third party. the company's charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company without the consent of our board. the company's charter permits a majority of its entire board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the company has the authority to issue. in addition, the company's board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although the company's board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the company's stockholders. the company's bylaws can be amended by our board or by the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders. the company's bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the company's board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by the company's board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the company's board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, at the time of giving of notice by the stockholder pursuant to the company's bylaws and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on any such other business and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the company's bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including mergers, consolidations, share exchanges, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, between the company and any interested stockholder, generally defined as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the company's common stock, or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by our board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 54 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows, arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates. the company manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with the company's risk management policies, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the quantitative disclosures in the following discussion are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity's functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. the majority of the company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, our foreign currency exchange risk is limited. the company is exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from its operating subsidiaries' transactions denominated in foreign currencies. to mitigate such risk, certain subsidiaries enter into forward currency contracts. as of june 27, 2020 and june 29, 2019 , forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount of $586.2 million and $398.4 million , respectively, were outstanding. as a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments will fail to meet their contractual obligations. to mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected financial institutions. the company also reviews the creditworthiness of our counterparties on a regular basis. as a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative contracts as of june 27, 2020 . the company is also exposed to transaction risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany loans. this primarily includes exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in the chinese renminbi, the british pound sterling and the euro. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company enters into forward currency contracts. as of june 27, 2020 and june 29, 2019 , the total notional values of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts related to these loans were $76.9 million and $14.5 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding forward currency contracts included in current assets at june 27, 2020 and june 29, 2019 was $2.9 million and $1.1 million , respectively. the fair value of outstanding foreign currency contracts included in current liabilities at june 27, 2020 and june 29, 2019 was $1.7 million and $4.9 million , respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. a sensitivity analysis of the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the fair values of our derivative contracts was performed to assess the risk of loss. as of june 27, 2020 , a 10% devaluation of the u.s. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under contract would result in an immaterial impact on derivative contract fair values. interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its revolving credit facility entered into under the credit agreement dated october 24, 2019 as amended may 19, 2020, the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes, 2027 senior notes (collectively the "senior notes") and investments. our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily attributable to debt outstanding under the revolving credit facility. borrowings under the facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the company's option, either (a) an alternate base rate (which is a rate equal to the greatest of (i) the prime rate in effect on such day, (ii) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of 1% or (iii) the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus 1%) or (b) a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the interbank market for u.s. dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made plus, in each case, an applicable margin. the applicable margin will be determined by reference to a grid, as defined in the credit agreement, based on the ratio of (a) consolidated debt plus operating lease liability to (b) consolidated ebitdar. a hypothetical 10% change in the credit agreement interest rate would have resulted in an immaterial change in interest expense in fiscal 2020 . furthermore, a prolonged disruption on our business resulting from the covid-19 pandemic may impact our ability to satisfy the terms of our revolving credit facility, including our liquidity covenant. the company is exposed to changes in interest rates related to the fair value of the senior notes. at june 27, 2020 , the fair value of the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes was approximately $577 million , $393 million and $565 million , respectively. at june 29, 2019, the fair value of the 2025 senior notes, 2022 senior notes and 2027 senior notes 54 was approximately $630 million , $399 million and $606 million , respectively. these fair values are based on external pricing data, including available quoted market prices of these instruments, and consideration of comparable debt instruments with similar interest rates and trading frequency, among other factors, and are classified as level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. the interest rate payable on the 2022 and 2027 senior notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either moody's or s&amp;p or a substitute rating agency (as defined in the prospectus supplement furnished with the sec on june 7, 2017) downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the respective senior notes of such series. the company's investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company's investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes.risk factors 11 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of coach wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. 11 table of contents we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 24% of our net sales coming from operations outside the u.s. however, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products and result in decreased international consumer demand or increase our supply costs in those markets, political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, and changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements through foreign currency hedging of coach japan u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements. a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business. many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach sales. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: availability of raw materials, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, disruptions or delays in shipments, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality issues, political unrest, and natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business. our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. in addition, because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated. 12 table of contents our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. however, over the past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. we expect that these trends will continue. provisions in coach charter and bylaws, maryland law or its poison pill may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach board of directors. coach charter permits its board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach stockholders. on may 3, 2001 coach declared a poison pill dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach common stock. subject to limited exceptions, these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or more of coach common stock or announces a tender offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors. in this event, each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the then-current market price. subject to certain exceptions, coach board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of coach board of directors becomes aware that, a person has acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. as of the end of fiscal 2007, there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights plan. coach bylaws can only be amended by coach board of directors. coach bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach board of directors. coach board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 31 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of 31 table of contents derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach risk management policies. coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. substantially all of coach fiscal 2007 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states. these countries include china, india, hungary, indonesia, italy, korea, mauritius, singapore, spain, taiwan and turkey. additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding coach japan, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. in japan, coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of coach japan u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. coach japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 12 months. as of june 30, 2007 and july 1, 2006, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $111.1 million and $114.8 million, respectively, were outstanding. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its $231 million u.s. dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach. to manage this risk, on july 1, 2005, coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a u.s. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. the loan matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and u.s. dollar based principals. the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 30, 2007 and july 1, 2006 were $23.3 million and $2.6 million, respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in yen exchange rates. coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in japanese yen and canadian dollars, are not material to the company consolidated financial statements. interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt. the company investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes. the company investment portfolio consists of u.s. government and agency securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities. as the company has both the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. at june 30, 2007, the company short term investments consisted of $628.9 million of auction rate securities. as auction rate securities market price equals its fair value, there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. 32 table of contents as of june 30, 2007, the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facilities and the company does not expect to borrow against the facilities in the foreseeable future. however, the fair value of any outstanding borrowings in the future may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of june 30, 2007, coach outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $3.1 million. a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach.risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the

with a notional amount of $233.9 million and $111.1 million, respectively, were outstanding. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its $231.0 million u.s. dollar denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach. to manage this risk, on july 1, 2005, coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a u.s. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. the loan matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and u.s. dollar based principals. 32 table of contents the fair values of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 28, 2008 and june 30, 2007 were $7.9 million and $23.3 million, respectively. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities as june 28, 2008 and june 30, 2007 was $5.5 million and $0, respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in yen exchange rates. coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in japanese yen and canadian dollars, are not material to the company consolidated financial statements. interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt. the company investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes. the company investment portfolio consists of u.s. government and agency securities as well as municipal government and corporate debt securities. at june 28, 2008, the company investments, classified as available-for-sale, consisted of $8.0 million of auction rate securities. as auction rate securities adjusted book value equals its fair value, there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. as of june 28, 2008, the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facilities. however, the fair value of any outstanding borrowings in the future may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of june 28, 2008, coach outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $2.9 million. a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach.risk factors 9 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the current economic crisis is having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, fuel and energy costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. 9 table of contents demand for our products is significantly impacted by negative trends in consumer confidence and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. the downturn in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of coach wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 28% of our net sales coming from operations outside the u.s. however, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates, political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, and changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan through foreign currency hedging of coach japan u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements. a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business. many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. a downturn in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach sales. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: availability of raw materials, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, 10 table of contents compliance with our global business practices, disruptions or delays in shipments, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, product quality issues, political unrest, and natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business. our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. in addition, because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. however, over the past several years, we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non-holiday quarters, which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.075 per common share. the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. provisions in coach charter and bylaws, maryland law or its poison pill may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach board of directors. coach charter permits its board of directors, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach board of directors has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach stockholders. on may 3, 2001 coach declared a poison pill dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach common stock. subject to limited 11 table of contents exceptions, these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or more of coach common stock or announces a tender offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board of directors. in this event, each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the then-current market price. subject to certain exceptions, coach board of directors will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of coach board of directors becomes aware that, a person has acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. as of the end of fiscal 2009, there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights plan. coach bylaws can only be amended by coach board of directors. coach bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach board of directors and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach board of directors or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach board of directors. coach board has exempted any business combination with us or any of our affiliates from the five-year prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 32 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach risk management policies. coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. substantially all of coach fiscal 2009 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states. these countries include china, italy, united states, hong kong, india, thailand, vietnam, turkey, philippines, ecuador, malaysia, mauritius, peru, spain and taiwan. additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding coach japan and coach china, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. in japan, coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of coach japan u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases. coach japan enters into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. the foreign currency contracts entered into by the company have durations no greater than 12 months. as of june 27, 2009 and june 28, 2008, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $32.0 million and $233.9 million, respectively, were outstanding. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its $231.0 million u.s. dollar-denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach. to manage this risk, on july 1, 2005, coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a u.s. dollar fixed interest rate for a yen fixed interest rate. the loan matures in 2010, at which point the swap requires an exchange of yen and u.s. dollar based principals. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 27, 2009 and june 28, 2008 was $0 and $7.9 million, respectively. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at june 27, 2009 and june 28, 2008 was $37.1 million and $5.5 million, respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in yen exchange rates. coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in japanese yen, chinese renminbi, hong kong dollar, macau pataca and canadian dollars, are not material to the company consolidated financial statements. interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt. the company investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes. the company investment portfolio consists of u.s. government and agency securities as well as municipal 32 table of contents government and corporate debt securities. at june 27, 2009, the company investments, classified as available-for-sale, consisted of a $6.0 million auction rate security. as auction rate securities adjusted book value equals its fair value, there are no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. as of june 27, 2009, the company had outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility maintained by coach shanghai limited of $7.5 million. the fair value of any current outstanding or future borrowings may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of june 27, 2009, coach outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $25.6 million. a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach.risk factors 10 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. the current uncertain economic conditions are having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, fuel and energy costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products is significantly impacted by negative trends in consumer confidence and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. the general economic conditions in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china, and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in europe and to take control of certain of our retail operations in the asia-pacific region. we do not yet have significant experience operating in these countries, and in many of them we face established competitors. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements. 10 table of contents furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of coach wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 30% of our net sales coming from operations outside the u.s. however, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates, political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, and changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan and canada through foreign currency hedging of our subsidiaries u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases, as well as coach japan u.s. dollar-denominated intercompany loan. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements. a downturn in the economy could affect consumer purchases of luxury items and adversely affect our business. many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market, including, among others, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. a downturn or a worsening of the current conditions in the economies in which coach sells its products may adversely affect coach sales. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of raw materials, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, compliance with our global business practices, disruptions or delays in shipments, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, 11 table of contents product quality issues, political unrest, and natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business. our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. in addition, because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.15 per common share. the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. further, there is proposed tax legislation that may be enacted in the future, which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. provisions in coach charter and bylaws, maryland law or its poison pill may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach charter and bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach board. coach charter permits its board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach stockholders. 12 table of contents on may 3, 2001 coach declared a poison pill dividend distribution of rights to buy additional common stock to the holder of each outstanding share of coach common stock. subject to limited exceptions, these rights may be exercised if a person or group intentionally acquires 10% or more of coach common stock or announces a tender offer for 10% or more of the common stock on terms not approved by the coach board. in this event, each right would entitle the holder of each share of coach common stock to buy one additional common share of coach stock at an exercise price far below the then-current market price. subject to certain exceptions, coach board will be entitled to redeem the rights at $0.0001 per right at any time before the close of business on the tenth day following either the public announcement that, or the date on which a majority of coach board becomes aware that, a person has acquired 10% or more of the outstanding common stock. as of the end of fiscal 2010, there were no shareholders whose common stock holdings exceeded the 10% threshold established by the rights plan. coach bylaws can only be amended by coach board. coach bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach board. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 35 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan and coach canada. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach risk management policies. coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. substantially all of coach fiscal 2010 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states. these countries include china, italy, hong kong, india, thailand, vietnam, peru, philippines, turkey, ecuador, great britain, macau and malaysia. additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding coach japan and coach china, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. in japan and canada, coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from coach japan and coach canada u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. coach japan and coach canada enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. as of july 3, 2010 and june 27, 2009, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $248.6 million and $32.0 million, respectively, were outstanding. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its $139.4 million u.s. dollar-denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach. to manage this risk, on july 2, 2010, coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a yen fixed interest rate for a u.s. dollar fixed interest rate. the loan matures on june 30, 2011, at which point the swap requires an exchange of japanese yen and u.s. dollar based notional values. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 3, 2010 and june 27, 2009 was $2.1 million and $0, respectively. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at july 3, 2010 and june 27, 2009 was $7.5 million and $37.1 million, respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates. 35 table of contents coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in japanese yen, chinese renminbi, hong kong dollar, macau pataca and canadian dollars, are not material to the company consolidated financial statements. interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt. the company investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes. the company investment portfolio consists of u.s. government and agency securities as well as corporate debt securities. as the company does not have the intent to sell and will not be required to sell these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. at july 3, 2010 and june 27, 2009, the company investments, classified as held-to-maturity, consisted of commercial paper and treasury bills valued at $99.9 million and $0, on those dates respectively. as the adjusted book value of the commercial paper and treasury bills equals its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. at july 3, 2010, the company investments, classified as available-for-sale, consisted of a $6.0 million auction rate security. at july 3, 2010, as the auction rate securities adjusted book value equaled its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. as of july 3, 2010, the company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank of america facility. the fair value of any future borrowings may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of july 3, 2010, the company had no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility maintained by coach japan. the fair value of any future borrowings may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of july 3, 2010, the company had no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility maintained by coach shanghai limited. the fair value of any future borrowings may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of july 3, 2010, coach outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $24.9 million. a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach.risk factors 10 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. the current uncertain global economic conditions are having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the general economic conditions in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china, and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in europe and to take control of certain of our retail operations in the asia-pacific region. we do not yet have significant experience operating in these countries, and in many of them we face established competitors. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements. 10 table of contents furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of coach wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 30% of our net sales coming from operations outside the u.s. however, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates, political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, natural and other disasters in international and other markets such as the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan, and changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. we monitor our foreign currency exposure in japan and canada and in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we hedge our subsidiaries u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases, as well as coach japan u.s. dollar-denominated intercompany loan. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will succeed in offsetting any impact of foreign currency rate movements. failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operation. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal or other appropriate action. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associates with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws. 11 table of contents our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of or significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports, increases in the cost of labor, fuel, travel and transportation, compliance with our global business integrity program, disruptions or delays in shipments, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company cost-effective sourcing model, product quality issues, political unrest, and natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier selection guidelines, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website, coach.com. the violation of labor or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer or suppliers labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing sites, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our overall profitability. labor costs at many of our manufacturers has been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials or labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. these increasing costs of productions could also adversely affect our ability to achieve the gross margin objectives we have established. our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. in addition, because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our business. 12 table of contents our indirect segment could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our indirect segment, consisting of the u.s. wholesale and coach international businesses comprised approximately 13% of total net sales for fiscal 2011. continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within our indirect segment. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. poor sales in coach second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.225 per common share. the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. further, there is proposed tax legislation that may be enacted in the future, which could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. provisions in coach charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach board. coach charter permits its board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach stockholders. 13 table of contents coach bylaws can only be amended by coach board. coach bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach board. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 36 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan and coach canada. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach risk management policies. coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. 36 table of contents foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. substantially all of coach fiscal 2011 non-licensed product needs were purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states. these countries include china, united states, italy, hong kong, india, thailand, vietnam, macau, philippines, turkey, colombia, malaysia, mexico, peru, south africa and taiwan. additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding consumer sales at coach japan, coach canada and coach china, are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. in japan and canada, coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from coach japan and coach canada u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. coach japan and coach canada enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. as of july 2, 2011 and july 3, 2010, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $171.0 million and $248.6 million, respectively, were outstanding. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its $109.1 million u.s. dollar-denominated fixed rate intercompany loan from coach. to manage this risk, on june 30, 2011, coach japan entered into a cross currency swap transaction, the terms of which include an exchange of a yen fixed interest rate for a u.s. dollar fixed interest rate. the loan matures on december 29, 2011, at which point the swap requires an exchange of japanese yen and u.s. dollar based notional values. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at july 2, 2011 and july 3, 2010 was $2.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at july 2, 2011 and july 3, 2010 was $1.7 million and $7.5 million, respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates. coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in japanese yen, chinese renminbi, hong kong dollar, macau pataca and canadian dollars, are not material to the company consolidated financial statements. interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt. the company investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes. the company investment portfolio consists of u.s. government and agency securities as well as corporate debt securities. as the company does not have the intent to sell and will not be required to sell these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. at july 2, 2011 and july 3, 2010, the company investments, classified as held-to-maturity, consisted of commercial paper and treasury bills valued at $2.3 million and $99.9 million, on those dates respectively. as the adjusted book value of the commercial paper and treasury bills equals its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. at july 2, 2011, the company investments, classified as available-for-sale, consisted of a $6.0 million auction rate security. at july 2, 2011, as the auction rate securities adjusted book value equaled its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with this investment. 37 table of contents as of july 2, 2011, the company had no outstanding borrowings on its bank of america facility, its revolving credit facility maintained by coach japan, and its revolving credit facility maintained by coach shanghai limited. the fair value of any future borrowing may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of july 2, 2011, coach outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $24.2 million. a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach.risk factors 12 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. the current economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. the current uncertain global economic conditions are having a significant negative impact on businesses around the world. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the general economic conditions in the economy may continue to affect consumer purchases of our products for the foreseeable future and adversely impact our results of operations. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china and other international markets, and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in europe. in addition, we have recently taken control of certain of our retail operations in the asia-pacific region, including taiwan, malaysia and south korea during calendar year 2012. we do not yet have significant experience directly operating in these countries, and in many of them we face established competitors. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront short-term investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands as well as private label retailers, including some of coach wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, 12 table of contents which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 32% of our net sales coming from operations outside the u.s. however, sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates, political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, natural and other disasters in international and other markets, and changes in foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure and in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our subsidiaries u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in japan and canada, as well as coach cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operation. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associates with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws. cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use 13 table of contents reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of or significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports, increases in the cost of labor, fuel, travel and transportation, compliance with our global business integrity program, disruptions or delays in shipments, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company cost-effective sourcing model, product quality issues, political unrest, and natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier selection guidelines, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website, coach.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer or supplier labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business. we maintain three primary distribution centers: a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, owned and operated by coach, an asia distribution center in shanghai, owned and operated by a third-party, and a distribution center, through a third-party, in japan. see distribution section of item 1. business for further discussion. the warehousing of 14 table of contents coach merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center operation could adversely affect our business and operations. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our overall profitability. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials or labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. these increasing costs of productions could also adversely affect our ability to achieve the gross margin objectives we have established. our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. in addition, because coach places orders for products with its manufacturers before it receives wholesale customers orders, it could experience higher excess inventories if wholesale customers order fewer products than anticipated. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our business. our indirect segment could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our indirect segment, consisting of the u.s. wholesale and coach international businesses comprised approximately 11% of total net sales for fiscal 2012. continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within our indirect segment. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. poor sales in coach second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. our quarterly cash dividend is currently $0.30 per common share. the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our operating results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many u.s. and certain foreign jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which includes reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results 15 table of contents of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. provisions in coach charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach board. coach charter permits its board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach stockholders. coach bylaws can only be amended by coach board. coach bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach board. risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts ( hdrs ) an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly. we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange can develop or be sustained. if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained, the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected. as a result, the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach common stock on the nyse, even allowing for currency differences. the characteristics of the u.s. capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different. the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different levels of retail and institutional participation). as a result of these differences, the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same, even allowing for currency differences. fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances peculiar to the u.s. capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs. because of the different characteristics of the u.s. and hong kong equity markets, the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by u.s. federal and maryland state laws and regulations. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange. our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations. u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a 16 table of contents number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong. there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong. we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong (the sfc ) that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence, these codes will not apply to us. we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong. in addition, we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules. neither our stockholders nor the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules, regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied, and been granted, waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc. additionally, if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our non-compliance with applicable undertakings for any reason, additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming, and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance, which could adversely affect us and hdr holders. as the sfc does not have extra-territorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement, it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states. investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates. furthermore, prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware, among other things, that there are u.s. federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders. hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs (the hdr depositary ) to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company. hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders. they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs (the deposit agreement ). holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders meetings, and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary. there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs, or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote, although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote. as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs, holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary (or its nominee) to exercise rights on their behalf. in addition, holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs. holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them. if we decide to undertake an equity offering (that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders), hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock, as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering. holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers. any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs. an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers, including but not limited to the hdr depositary, the registrar for the hdrs, the custodian and any sub-custodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock. a failure by any of those service 17 table of contents providers to meet their contractual obligations, whether or not by culpable default, could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment. coach will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian, any sub-custodian or the registrar; hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited. however, coach and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary. withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs. our common stock is presently traded on the nyse. any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse. upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock, the relevant hdrs will be cancelled. in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled, the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected. the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock (and vice versa) might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period. there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded. in addition, the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa). investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay. in addition, there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate. investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and u.s. dollars. the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar/hong kong dollar exchange rate. while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the u.s. dollar using a specified trading band, no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 41 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. coach manages these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments with respect to coach japan and coach canada. the use of derivative financial instruments is in accordance with coach risk management policies. coach does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. the following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying 41 table of contents terms and maturities and theoretical pricing models. these quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. foreign currency exchange foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s. dollars. substantially all of coach fiscal 2012 non-licensed product needs are purchased from independent manufacturers in countries other than the united states, including china, vietnam, india, philippines, thailand, italy, taiwan, peru, malaysia, columbia, turkey and great britain. additionally, sales are made through international channels to third party distributors. substantially all purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding consumer sales at coach japan, coach canada, coach china, coach singapore, and coach taiwan are denominated in u.s. dollars and, therefore, are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. in japan and canada, coach is exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from coach japan and coach canada u.s. dollar denominated inventory purchases. coach japan and coach canada enter into certain foreign currency derivative contracts, primarily zero-cost collar options, to manage these risks. as of june 30, 2012 and july 2, 2011, open foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges with a notional amount of $310.9 million and $171.0 million, respectively, were outstanding. coach had exposure to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to coach japan as a result of its $65.0 million u.s. dollar-denominated fixed rate intercompany loan. to manage this risk, on december 29, 2011, coach japan entered into a cross-currency swap transaction, the terms of which included an exchange of japanese yen fixed interest for u.s. dollar fixed interest. the loan and swap were settled at maturity in june 2012, at which point the swap required an exchange of japanese yen and u.s. dollar based notional values. coach is also exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to various cross-currency intercompany and related party loans. these loans are denominated in various foreign currencies, with a total notional value of approximately $207 million as of june 30, 2012. to manage the exchange rate risk related to these loans, the company entered into forward exchange and cross-currency swap contracts, the terms of which include the exchange of foreign currency fixed interest for u.s. dollar fixed interest and an exchange of the foreign currency and u.s. dollar based notional values at the maturity dates of the contracts, the latest of which is june 2013. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current assets at june 30, 2012 and july 2, 2011 was $1.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively. the fair value of open foreign currency derivatives included in current liabilities at june 30, 2012 and july 2, 2011 was $4.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. coach believes that exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with revenues and expenses of foreign operations, which are denominated in japanese yen, chinese renminbi, hong kong dollar, macanese pataca, canadian dollar, singapore dollar, taiwan dollar, malaysian ringgit, korean won and the euro, are not material to the company consolidated financial statements. interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments, revolving credit facilities and long-term debt. the company investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company investment policy, which identifies allowable investments, specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes. the company investment portfolio primarily consists of u.s. government and agency securities as well as 42 table of contents corporate debt securities. as the company does not have the intent to sell and will not be required to sell these securities until maturity, investments are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost, except for auction rate securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. at july 2, 2011, the company investments, classified as held-to-maturity, consisted of commercial paper and treasury bills valued at $2.3 million. these investments matured during 2012, and the company does not hold any similar investments at june 30, 2012. as the adjusted book value of the commercial paper and treasury bills equaled its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with these investments. at june 30, 2012, the company investments, classified as available-for-sale, consisted of a $6.0 million auction rate security. at june 30, 2012, as the auction rate securities adjusted book value equaled its fair value, there were no unrealized gains or losses associated with this investment. as of june 30, 2012, the company had no outstanding borrowings on its jp morgan facility, its revolving credit facility maintained by coach japan, and its revolving credit facility maintained by coach shanghai limited. the fair value of any future borrowing may be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. as of june 30, 2012, coach outstanding long-term debt, including the current portion, was $23.4 million. a hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate applied to the fair value of debt would not have a material impact on earnings or cash flows of coach.risk factors 12 risk factors you should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of coach and forward-looking information in this document. please also see special note on forward-looking information at the beginning of this report. the risks described below are not the only ones we face. additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. if any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer. economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items. our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, fuel and energy costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. demand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag and accessories market generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as coach products, tend to decline during recessionary periods, when disposable income is lower. the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our efforts to expand internationally into a global lifestyle brand. our growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design and introduction of new products. our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. the failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position. additionally, our current growth strategy includes plans to expand in a number of international regions, including asia and europe. we currently plan to open additional coach stores in china, europe and other international markets, and we have entered into strategic agreements with various partners to expand our operations in south america. in addition, we have recently taken control of certain of our retail operations in europe and the asia-pacific region, including the united kingdom, spain, ireland, portugal, france and germany during calendar 2013, and malaysia and south korea during calendar year 2012. we do not yet have significant experience directly operating in these countries, and in many of them we face established competitors. many of these countries have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, and local reporting or legal requirements. furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. further, such markets will have upfront short-term investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to coach in the short-term. in many of these countries, there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. we have recently undertaken a transformation to broaden coach brand identification from primarily accessories, to instead being viewed as a global lifestyle brand, anchored in accessories. we plan to achieve this by building upon our strong management and design teams and enhancing and building out the coach experience through expanded and new product categories, enhanced retail environments and integrated marketing communications. however, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful in changing the perception of coach from an accessories brand to a global lifestyle brand. consequently, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, our transformation falls short, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our financial results could be materially adversely affected. 12 table of contents significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business. we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. our competitors are european and american luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of coach wholesale customers. there is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. we may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability. the success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of the coach brand and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner. we believe that the coach brand, established over 70 years ago, is regarded as america's preeminent designer, producer, and marketer of fine accessories and gifts for women and men. we attribute the prominence of the coach brand to the unique combination of our original american attitude and design, our heritage of fine leather goods and custom fabrics, our superior product quality and durability and our commitment to customer service. any misstep in product quality or design, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brand with our customers. furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. if we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing and retail environments that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. even if our products do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. we face risks associated with operating in international markets. we operate on a global basis, with approximately 31% of our net sales coming from operations outside of north america. while geographic diversity helps to reduce the company exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to: changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates, compliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the foreign corrupt practices act, the u.k. bribery act, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials, political or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, natural and other disasters, and changes in legal and regulatory requirements resulting in the imposition of new or more onerous trade restrictions, tariffs, embargoes, exchange or other government controls. we monitor our global foreign currency exposure and in order to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our subsidiaries u.s. dollar-denominated inventory purchases in japan and canada, as well as coach cross currency denominated intercompany loan portfolio. we cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to u.s. dollars. if the u.s. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. sales to our international wholesale customers are denominated in u.s. dollars. 13 table of contents failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure the brand and negatively affect sales. we believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. we devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. in spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operation. we are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. we cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associates with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. finally, many countries laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as us laws. computer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business. we depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. the possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. as part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. in addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. we also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. we have confidential security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. consumer awareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats is at an all-time high. any misappropriation of confidential or personally identifiable information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. we may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to comply with state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. lastly, we could face increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches. in addition, we maintain e-commerce sites in the u.s., canada, japan and china and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. in fiscal 2013, coach had informational websites in 28 countries. lastly, our e-commerce programs also include an invitation-only coach factory flash sale site and third-party flash sales sites. given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (ii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer viruses or power outages. any 14 table of contents material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. our business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities. as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: unavailability of or significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, compliance with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations, imposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports, increases in the cost of labor, fuel, travel and transportation, compliance with our global business integrity program, compliance with u.s. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of conflict minerals sourced from the democratic republic of the congo in the company products, disruptions or delays in shipments, loss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites, inability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the company cost-effective sourcing model, product quality issues, political unrest, and natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control. while we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our global operating principles and/or supplier selection guidelines, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. copies of our global business integrity program, global operating principles and supplier selection guidelines are posted on our website, coach.com. the violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer or supplier labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the u.s., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. while we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have an adverse impact on our business. we maintain a distribution center in jacksonville, florida, owned and operated by coach. to support our growth in china and the region, in fiscal 2010 we established an asia distribution center in shanghai, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in this region while reducing costs. we also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in japan, china, hong kong, singapore, taiwan, malaysia, korea and the netherlands. the warehousing of coach merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center operation could adversely affect our business and operations. increases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. the cost of transportation has been increasing as well and it is unlikely such cost pressure will abate if oil prices continue to increase. we may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means. 15 table of contents our business is subject to increased costs due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our products. if coach misjudges the market for its products it may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. if that occurs, we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brand. our north american wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the retail industry. our wholesale business, consisting of the u.s. wholesale business comprised approximately 5% of total net sales for fiscal 2013. continued consolidation in the retail industry could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, stores that carry our and our licensees products. furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel. we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business. we currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for our footwear, sunwear, watches and fragrance products. see item 1 business products where discussed further. in the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. the risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. while we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. further, while we believe that we could replace out existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business. our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of coach common stock. because coach products are frequently given as gifts, coach has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of november and december. poor sales in coach second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. in addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed. the dividend program requires the use of a modest portion of our cash flow. our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. this ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. our board of directors ( board ) may, at its discretion, decrease the intended level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price. 16 table of contents fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price. we are subject to income taxes in many u.s. and foreign jurisdictions. we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. at any one time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. as a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. in addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could negatively impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates. provisions in coach charter, bylaws and maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of coach by a third party. coach charter, bylaws and maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire coach without the consent of coach board. coach charter permits its board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that coach has the authority to issue. in addition, coach board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. although coach board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for coach common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of coach stockholders. coach bylaws can only be amended by coach board. coach bylaws also provide that nominations of persons for election to coach board and the proposal of business to be considered at a stockholders meeting may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by coach board or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures of coach bylaws. also, under maryland law, business combinations, including issuances of equity securities, between coach and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of coach common stock or an affiliate of such person are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the date such person last becomes a 10% stockholder, unless exempted in accordance with the statute. after this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless some conditions are met or the business combination is exempted by coach board. we could experience cost overruns and disruptions to our operations in connection with the construction of, and relocation to, our new global corporate headquarters. the company has entered into various agreements relating to the development of the company new global corporate headquarters in a new office building to be located at the hudson yards development site in new york city. the financing, development and construction of the new building is taking place through a joint venture between the company and the developers. construction of the new building has commenced and occupancy in the new global headquarters is currently expected to take place in calendar 2015. during fiscal 2013, the company invested $93.9 million in the hudson yards joint venture. the company expects to invest approximately $440 million in the joint venture over the next three years, with approximately $130 million to $160 million estimated in fiscal 2014, depending on construction progress. outside of the joint venture, the company is directly investing in aspects of the new corporate headquarters. in fiscal 2013, $24.8 million was included in capital expenditures and we expect $190 million of additional expenditures over the remaining period of construction. the company allocable share of the joint venture investments and capital expenditures will be financed by the company with cash on hand, borrowings under its credit facility and approximately $130 million of proceeds from the sale of its current headquarters buildings. due to the inherent difficulty in estimating costs associated with projects of this scale and nature, together with the fact that we are in the early stages of construction of the project, certain of the costs associated with this project may be higher than estimated and it may take longer than expected to complete 17 table of contents the project. in addition, the process of moving our headquarters is inherently complex and not part of our day to day operations. thus, that process could cause significant disruption to our operations and cause the temporary diversion of management resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. in addition, we cannot give any assurance that our developer will complete its obligations in a timely manner or at all or how changes in the overall development of the hudson yards project may impact the development of, or value of, the building in which our new global headquarters will be located. further, our developer has financing, construction and development obligations to parties other than us, and we cannot give any assurance as to how those obligations may impact the development of the project. the ownership of real property, such as the new global corporate headquarters, also subjects us to various other risks, including, among others: - the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with correcting any environmental problems; - the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the new building as a result of fire, floods, or other natural disasters; and - adverse changes in the value of these properties, due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors. risks relating to our hong kong depositary receipts ( hdrs ) an active trading market for the hong kong depositary receipts on the hong kong stock exchange might not develop or be sustained and their trading prices might fluctuate significantly. we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange can develop or be sustained. if an active trading market of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange does not develop or is not sustained, the market price and liquidity of the hdrs could be materially and adversely affected. as a result, the market price for hdrs in hong kong might not be indicative of the trading prices of coach common stock on the nyse, even allowing for currency differences. the characteristics of the u.s. capital markets and the hong kong capital markets are different. the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange have different trading hours, trading characteristics (including trading volume and liquidity), trading and listing rules, and investor bases (including different levels of retail and institutional participation). as a result of these differences, the trading prices of common stock and the hdrs representing them might not be the same, even allowing for currency differences. fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to circumstances peculiar to the u.s. capital markets could materially and adversely affect the price of the hdrs. because of the different characteristics of the u.s. and hong kong equity markets, the historic market prices of our common stock may not be indicative of the performance of the hdrs. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our corporate governance practices are principally governed by u.s. federal and maryland state laws and regulations. we are a corporation incorporated in the state of maryland in the united states and our hdrs are listed on the hong kong stock exchange. our corporate governance practices are primarily governed by and subject to u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations. u.s. federal and maryland laws and regulations differ in a number of respects from comparable laws and regulations in hong kong. there are certain differences between the stockholder protection regimes in maryland and the united states and in hong kong. we have obtained a ruling from the securities and futures commission of hong kong (the sfc ) that we will not be regarded as a public company in hong kong for the purposes of the code on takeovers and mergers and the share repurchases code of hong kong and hence, these codes will not apply to us. we have also obtained a partial exemption from the sfc in respect of the disclosure of interest provisions set out in the securities and futures ordinance of hong kong. in addition, we have been granted waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange from certain requirements under its listing rules. neither our stockholders nor 18 table of contents the hdr holders will have the benefit of those hong kong rules, regulations and the listing rules of the hong kong stock exchange for which we have applied, and been granted, waivers or exemptions by the hong kong stock exchange and sfc. additionally, if any of these waivers or exemptions were to be revoked in circumstances including our non-compliance with applicable undertakings for any reason, additional legal and compliance obligations might be costly and time consuming, and might result in issues of interjurisdictional compliance, which could adversely affect us and hdr holders. as the sfc does not have extra-territorial jurisdiction on any of its powers of investigation and enforcement, it will also have to rely on the regulatory regimes of maryland state authorities and the sec to enforce any corporate governance breaches committed by us in the united states. investors in the hdrs should be aware that it could be difficult to enforce any judgment obtained outside the united states against us or any of our associates. furthermore, prospective investors in the hdrs should be aware, among other things, that there are u.s. federal withholding and estate tax implications for hdr holders. hdr holders are not stockholders of the company and must rely on the depositary for the hdrs (the hdr depositary ) to exercise on their behalf the rights that are otherwise available to the stockholders of the company. hdr holders do not have the rights of stockholders. they only have the contractual rights set forth for their benefit under the deposit agreement for the hdrs (the deposit agreement ). holders of hdrs are not permitted to vote at stockholders meetings, and they may only vote by providing instructions to the hdr depositary. there is no guarantee that holders of hdrs will receive voting materials in time to instruct the hdr depositary to vote and it is possible that holders of hdrs, or persons who hold their hong kong depositary shares through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote, although both we and the hdr depositary will endeavor to make arrangements to ensure as far as practicable that all holders of hdrs will be able to vote. as the hdr depositary or its nominee will be the registered owner of the common stock underlying their hdrs, holders of hdrs must rely on the hdr depositary (or its nominee) to exercise rights on their behalf. in addition, holders of hdrs will also incur charges on any cash distribution made pursuant to the deposit agreement and on transfers of certificated hdrs. holders of hdrs will experience dilution in their indirect interest in the company in the event of an equity offering which is not extended to them. if we decide to undertake an equity offering (that is not a rights or other offering that is extended to hdr holders), hdr holders may suffer a dilution in their indirect ownership and voting interest in the common stock, as compared to their holdings in the hdrs immediately prior to such an offering. holders of hdrs will be reliant upon the performance of several service providers. any breach of those service providers of their contractual obligations could have adverse consequences for an investment in hdrs. an investment in hdrs will depend for its continuing viability on the performance of several service providers, including but not limited to the hdr depositary, the registrar for the hdrs, the custodian and any sub-custodian appointed in respect of the underlying common stock. a failure by any of those service providers to meet their contractual obligations, whether or not by culpable default, could detract from the continuing viability of the hdrs as an investment. coach will not have direct contractual recourse against the custodian, any sub-custodian or the registrar; hence the potential for redress in circumstances of default will be limited. however, coach and the hdr depositary have executed a deed poll in favor of hdr holders in relation to the exercise by them of their rights as hdr holders under the deposit agreement against the company or the hdr depositary. 19 table of contents withdrawals and exchanges of hdrs into common stock traded on the nyse might adversely affect the liquidity of the hdrs. our common stock is presently traded on the nyse. any hdr holder may at any time request that their hdrs be withdrawn and exchanged into common stock for trading on the nyse. upon the exchange of hdrs into common stock, the relevant hdrs will be cancelled. in the event that a substantial number of hdrs are withdrawn and exchanged into common stock and subsequently cancelled, the liquidity of the hdrs on the hong kong stock exchange might be adversely affected. the time required for hdrs to be exchanged into common stock (and vice versa) might be longer than expected and investors might not be able to settle or effect any sales of their securities during this period. there is no direct trading or settlement between the nyse and the hong kong stock exchange on which the common stock and the hdrs are respectively traded. in addition, the time differences between hong kong and new york and unforeseen market circumstances or other factors may delay the exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa). investors will be prevented from settling or effecting the sale of their securities across the various stock exchanges during such periods of delay. in addition, there is no assurance that any exchange of hdrs into common stock (and vice versa) will be completed in accordance with the timelines investors might anticipate. investors are subject to exchange rate risk between hong kong dollars and u.s. dollars. the value of an investment in the hdrs quoted in hong kong dollars and the value of dividend payments in respect of the hdrs could be affected by fluctuations in the u.s. dollar/hong kong dollar exchange rate. while the hong kong dollar is currently linked to the u.s. dollar using a specified trading band, no assurance can be given that the hong kong government will maintain the trading band at its current limits or at all. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 49

including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than the entity functional currency, and from foreign-denominated revenues and expenses translated into u.s.

swap contracts, the terms of which include the exchange of foreign currency fixed interest for u.s. dollar fixed interest and an exchange of the foreign currency and u.s. dollar based notional values at the maturity dates of the contracts, the latest of which is may 2014. as of june 29, 2013 and june 30, 2012, the total notional values of outstanding forward exchange and cross-currency swap

million, respectively. the fair value of these contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. interest rate coach is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to its investments and revolving credit facilities. the company investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with the company investment policy, which defines our investment principles including credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer. the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing interest income and minimizing risk. we do not hold any investments for trading purposes. beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the company investment portfolio also consisted of high-credit quality u.s. and non-u.s. issued corporate debt securities, classified as available-for-sale, with a fair value of $99.5 million at june 29, 2013. these securities have maturity dates between calendar years 2014 and 2016. at june 29,

and june 30, 2012, respectively, primarily consisted of a cash equivalent portfolio and corporate debt securities and u.s. government and agency securities. as the company does not have the intent to sell and will not be required to sell these securities until maturity, cash equivalents are classified as held-to-maturity and stated at amortized cost. as of june 29, 2013, the company had no outstanding borrowings on its jp morgan facility, the coach japan credit facilities, and the coach shanghai limited credit facility. the fair value of any future borrowing may be impacted by
